These kinases function downstream of RAS as part of the MAPK (RAF_MEK_ERK) signaling cascade that facilitates cell proliferation, survival and transformation (Holderfield et al., 2014; 24957944, Burotto et al., 2014; 24948110). BRAF mutations have been reported in up to 20% of all cancers, with the majority of mutations occurring at the V600 position (Davies et al., 2002; 12068308, Kandoth et al., 2013; 24132290). Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. BRAF mutation has been reported in up to 9.1% of small intestine adenocarcinoma cases, and the incidence may vary by site (Pandya et al., 2022; 35267592, Schrock et al., 2017; 28617917, Jun et al., 2016; 26892442, Xia et al., 2017; 27258561). Small intestine adenocarcinomas were reported to harbor a relatively low frequency of V600E mutations among the BRAF_mutant cases (3/29 or 10%) compared to other gastrointestinal cancer types (Pandya et al., 2022; 35267592, Schrock et al., 2017; 28617917). Unlike the case in colorectal cancer, BRAF mutations are not enriched in microsatellite_unstable small intestine adenocarcinomas (Warth et al., 2011; 21297586, Xia et al., 2017; 27258561). One study reported a non_significant trend toward shorter OS for patients with KRAS_ or BRAF_mutated small intestine adenocarcinoma compared to those with tumors lacking mutations in either KRAS or BRAF (Jun et al., 2016; 26892442). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of BRAF alterations in small intestine carcinoma are limited (PubMed, Jun 2022). BRAF and MEK inhibitors have shown efficacy for patients with activating BRAF alterations at the V600 codon; clinical outcomes are more limited for class 2 alterations in BRAF such as one or more of the alterations seen here. A retrospective study of immunotherapies in NSCLC reported a 69% DCR (9/13) for patients with class 2 mutations (Marin_Acevedo et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract e21016). MEK inhibitors alone or in combination with RAF inhibitors also may be of benefit in these alterations (Nikanjam et al., 2021; 33722853, Nebhan et al., 2021; 33861486, Gautschi et al., 2015; 26200454, Negrao et al., 2020; 32540409). Doublet RAF_ and MEK_directed therapy may be more efficacious relative to either monotherapy; a retrospective analysis of BRAF_mutated melanoma observed 5/16 patient responses to BRAF inhibitor with MEK inhibitor therapy in BRAF class 2 tumors and 0/13 responses to BRAF inhibitor monotherapy (Menzer et al., 2019; 31580757). A basket trial of single_agent BRAF_inhibitor vemurafenib (n=11) (Hainsworth et al., 2018; 29320312) and a trial in NSCLC (n=9) (Mazieres et al., 2020; 31959346) also did not yield any responses for patients with class 2 tumors. In a basket trial of single_agent MEK_inhibitor trametinib, no responses were observed for patients with class 2 tumors (3 SDs, n=5) (Johnson et al., 2020; 31924734). Investigational ERK inhibitors are also in development; a basket trial of ulixertinib reported 3 PRs for patients across class 2_mutated tumors (Sullivan et al., 2018; 29247021). A basket trial of second_generation investigational BRAF inhibitor PLX8394 reported 3 SDs and 4 PDs for patients with class 2 tumors (Janku et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT212). In 2 Phase 1 studies evaluating the MEK_pan_RAF dual inhibitor CH5126766, 3 patients harboring BRAF V600E mutations experienced PRs, including 2 patients with melanoma (Martinez_Garcia et al., 2012; 22761467) and 1 patient with low_grade serous ovarian carcinoma (Guo et al., 2020; 33128873).

FBXW7 inactivation is associated with chromosomal instability and with stabilization of proto_oncogenes, such as mTOR, MYC, cyclin E, NOTCH, and JUN; FBXW7 is therefore considered a tumor suppressor (Akhoondi et al., 2007; 17909001, Welcker and Clurman, 2008; 18094723). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt FBXW7 function or expression (Welcker et al., 2013; 24298052, Welcker et al., 2007; 17298674, Strohmaier et al., 2001; 11565034, Pashkova et al., 2010; 21070969, Akhoondi et al., 2007; 17909001, O Neil et al., 2007; 17646409, Malyukova et al., 2013; 23228967, Thompson et al., 2007; 17646408). FBXW7 mutations have been reported in various solid tumors including endometrial (14%), colorectal (9.3%), bladder (7.6%), head and neck (5.4%), and gastroesophageal (3.2%) (cBio_Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of FBXW7 alteration in small intestine adenocarcinoma are limited (PubMed, Jun 2022). FBXW7 inactivating alterations may indicate sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors (Mao et al., 2008; 18787170, Yang et al., 2015; 25749036).

Activating mutations in RAS genes can cause uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor formation (Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Kahn et al., 1987; 3310850). KRAS alterations affecting amino acids G12, G13, Q22, P34, A59, Q61, and A146, as well as mutations G10_A11insG, G10_A11insAG (also reported as G10_A11dup and G12_G13insAG), A18D, L19F, D33E, G60_A66dup/E62_A66dup, E62K, E63K, R68S, and K117N have been characterized as activating and oncogenic (Akagi et al., 2007; 17150185, Bollag et al., 1996; 8955068, Buhrman et al., 2010; 20194776, Colicelli, 2004; 15367757, Edkins et al., 2006; 16969076, Feig and Cooper, 1988; 3043178, Gremer et al., 2011; 20949621, Janakiraman et al., 2010; 20570890, Kim et al., 2016; 27147599, Lukman et al., 2010; 20838576, Naguib et al., 2011; 21371307, Prior et al., 2012; 22589270, Priv\u00e9 et al., 1992; 1565661, Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Scheffzek et al., 1997; 9219684, Scholl et al., 2009; 19490892, Smith et al., 2010; 20147967, Tyner et al., 2009; 19075190, Valencia et al., 1991; 2029511, White et al., 2016; 26854029, Wiest et al., 1994; 8058307, Kim et al., 2016; 27147599, Angeles et al., 2019; 31289513, Tong et al., 2014; 24642870, Loree et al., 2021; 34117033). Genomic alterations in KRAS have been observed in 55% of small intestine cancers analyzed in 1 study (Takeda et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 642). In 1 study of 37 small bowel adenocarcinomas, KRAS mutations were reported to be more prevalent in chromosomal instable carcinomas (CIN; 55%) than in either microsatellite instable carcinomas (MSI_H; 0%) or microsatellite and chromosomally stable carcinomas (MACS; 10%) (Warth et al., 2011; 21297586). One study reported a non_significant trend toward shorter OS for patients with KRAS_ or BRAF_mutated small intestine adenocarcinoma compared to those with tumors lacking mutations in either KRAS or BRAF (Jun et al., 2016; 26892442). A study of duodenal adenocarcinoma tumors reported that KRAS G_to_A transition mutations were associated with late stage and poor tumor differentiation, as well as with a higher risk of relapse and shorter overall patient survival (Fu et al., 2013; 23065691). Preclinical evidence suggests that KRAS activation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, such as trametinib, binimetinib, cobimetinib, and selumetinib (Nakano et al., 1984; 6320174, Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Yamaguchi et al., 2011; 21523318, Watanabe et al., 2013; 23438367, Gilmartin et al., 2011; 21245089, Yeh et al., 2009; 19372556). In a Phase 1 study evaluating the MEK_pan_RAF dual inhibitor CH5126766, 6 patients harboring KRAS mutations experienced PRs, including 3 with non_small cell lung cancer (NCSLC), 1 with low_grade serous ovarian carcinoma (LGSOC), 1 with endometrial adenocarcinoma, and 1 with multiple myeloma (Guo et al., 2020; 33128873). Combination of CH5126766 with the FAK inhibitor defactinib elicited PR rates of 50% (4/8) for patients with KRAS_mutated low_grade serous ovarian cancer and 12% (2/17) for patients with KRAS_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a Phase 1 study (Krebs et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT019, Shinde et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT143). Preclinical and clinical data suggest that KRAS mutations may predict clinical benefit from SHP2 inhibitors (Lu et al., 2019; 31068384, Mainardi et al., 2018; 29808006, Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001, Brana et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3005, Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). A Phase 1 study of RMC_4630 for relapsed/refractory solid tumors reported a DCR of 58% (23/40) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS mutations and a DCR of 75% (12/16) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS G12C mutations (Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001). Interim results from a Phase 1/2 study of RMC_4630 plus cobimetinib reported tumor reduction in 3 of 8 patients with KRAS_mutated colorectal cancer (Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). Preclinical data suggest that KRAS mutation may confer sensitivity to SOS1 inhibitors (Hillig et al., 2019; 30683722, Hofmann et al., 2021; 32816843, Gerlach et al., 2020; AACR Abstract 1091). Phase 1 studies of the SOS1 inhibitor BI 1701963 alone or in combination with MEK inhibitors, KRAS G12C inhibitors, or irinotecan are recruiting for patients with solid tumors harboring KRAS mutations (Hofmann et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT210, Gort et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract TPS3651). While clinical responses have been reported for patients with KRAS_mutated ovarian (Monk et al., 2020; 32822286, Farley et al., 2013; 23261356, Pejovic et al., 2015; Am J Clin Exp Obstet Gynecol 2:140_143, Slosberg et al., 2018; 29765547, Han et al., 2018; 29946554), cervical small cell neuroendocrine (Lyons et al., 2014; 26075998), or uterine cancer (Slosberg et al., 2018; 29765547) treated with MEK inhibitor monotherapy, multiple clinical trials have not demonstrated increased response rates for patients with KRAS_altered tumors including KRAS_mutated CRC (Tsimberidou et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract e22086, Infante et al., 2012; 22805291, Zimmer et al., 2014; 24947927, Bennouna et al., 2011; 20127139, Weekes et al., 2013; 23434733), pancreatic cancer (Van Laethem et al., 2017; 27975152, Infante et al., 2014; 24915778, Van Cutsem et al., 2018; 29756206), and NSCLC (Blumenschein et al., 2015; 25722381, Leijen et al., 2012; 22767668, Zimmer et al., 2014; 24947927). A Phase 2 study of trametinib and uprosertib for patients with recurrent cervical cancer reported no responses for patients with KRAS_mutated (2/2 SDs) or KRAS_amplified (1/1 SD) cancer (Lui et al., 2019; 31118140). Clinical responses have been reported for combination treatment strategies including MEK inhibitors with PI3K or AKT inhibitors for patients with KRAS_mutated ovarian cancer (Spreafico et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 5506, Juric et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 9051, Banerji et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract e13559) and KRAS_mutated endometrioid adenocarcinoma (Shapiro et al., 2019; 31020608).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "KRAS activating mutations or amplification may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of MAPK pathway components, including MEK inhibitors.

High bTMB levels were not detected in this sample. It is unclear whether the bTMB levels in this sample would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Depending on the clinical context, TMB testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. Average bTMB levels in solid tumors other than NSCLC have not been evaluated (PubMed, Mar 2022). One study reported that amongst a cohort of patients with small bowel cancer (n=23), high TMB (>10 Mut/Mb) was associated with favorable OS (p<0.05) (Tsuboi et al., 2021; 34014970). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB) may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716), anti_PD_1 (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716), anti_PD_1/CTLA4 therapies (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P), anti_PD_L1/CTLA4 therapies (Chen et al., 2020; 32379280, Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511, Rizvi et al., 2020; 32271377, Si et al., 2021; 33355200, Leighl et al., 2022; 34800700). A Phase 2 multi_solid_tumor trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022). In non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single_agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 Muts/Mb_16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2020; 32271377, Si et al., 2021; 33355200, Leighl et al., 2022; 34800700). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI_H has been frequently reported in carcinomas of the small bowel (Alvi et al., 2015; 26315110, Gingras et al., 2015; AACR Pancreatic Cancer Abstract PR06)(Blaker et al., 2002; 11791187, Bruecki et al., 2004; 14732226, Hibi et al., 1995; 7775257, Overman et al., 2010; 19935793, Rashid et al., 1997; 9207270, Wheeler et al., 2002; 11788563), with larger studies reporting a rate of 10.4_19.6% of small intestine carcinomas (Planck et al., 2003; 12627520, Michel et al., 2010; 19852062, Ruemmele et al., 2009; 19252434). MSI_H small intestine adenocarcinomas were reported to be higher tumor grade and associated with longer median overall survival (49.6 vs. 23.2 months) than MSS tumors (Bruecki et al., 2004; 14732226, Ruemmele et al., 2009; 19252434, Muneyuki et al., 2000; 11117578, Agaramet al., 2010; 20395525). On the basis of prospective clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD_1_targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Shitara et al., 2022; 35322232, Andre et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 244, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143), as well as PD_L1_targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92).

TET2 alterations have been reported at relatively low frequencies in solid tumors and are more prevalent in hematological malignancies (cBioPortal, Jan 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of TET2 alterations in solid tumors are limited (PubMed, Jan 2022). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in TET2 in solid tumors. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838).

TP53 alterations have been reported in 50_60% of small intestine cancer cases (Alvi et al., 2015; 26315110, Takeda et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 642), and mutations were observed in 1 of 10 duodenal carcinomas and 3 of 10 jejunal/ileal carcinomas in another study (Muneyuki et al., 2000; 11117578). Loss of 17p heterozygosity, where the TP53 gene resides, has been observed in 20_67% of duodenal and 20% of ileal/jejunal carcinomas (Achille et al., 1998; 9514055, Muneyuki et al., 2000; 11117578). Expression of p53 has been observed in 24_53.3% of small intestine carcinomas (Arai et al., 1997; 9033644, Wheeler et al., 2002; 11788563, Nishiyama et al., 2002; 11836595). In one study, expression of p53 was more common in poorly differentiated tumors (71%) as compared with well_differentiated cases (30%) (Nishiyama et al., 2002; 11836595). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended.

The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with elevated tumor fraction values have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus high sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at low risk of false negative results. However, if elevated tumor fraction is not detected, it does not exclude the presence of disease burden or compromise the confidence of reported alterations. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels. In the research setting, changes in tumor fraction estimates have been associated with treatment duration and clinical response and may be a useful indicator for future cancer management (Bronkhorst et al., 2019; 30923679, Raja et al., 2018; 30093454, Hrebien et al., 2019; 30860573, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5039, Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Goodall et al., 2017; 28450425, Goldberg et al., 2018; 29330207).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "BRAF", "Alteration": "I592V", "Title": "Safety and Oversight of the Individually Tailored Treatment Approach: A Novel Pilot Study", "StudyPhase": "PHASE null", "Target": "CDK4, CDK6, PI3K_alpha, PD_L1, MEK, PARP, PD_1, BRAF", "Locations": "Melbourne (Australia)", "NCTID": "NCT04801966", "Note": "BRAF activating alterations may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of BRAF, MEK, or ERK.
