HRD and consequent genomic LOH occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one or more of the homologous recombination pathway proteins, including BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51C, ATM, PALB2, and BRIP1 (Vanderstichele et al., 2017; 28950147, Watkins et al., 2014; 25093514, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2011; 21720365, Venkitaraman, 2003; 12736286). This sample harbors a genomic LOH score below levels that have been associated with improved rates of clinical benefit from treatment with the PARP inhibitor rucaparib in patients with platinum_sensitive, BRCA1/2 wild_type ovarian, peritoneal, or Fallopian tube carcinoma (Coleman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5540, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). However, patients with lower genomic LOH have also responded to rucaparib, and this type of LOH score does not preclude benefit from PARP inhibitors (Coleman et al., 2017; 28916367, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). In a study of more than 4,000 ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer samples, genomic LOH score \u2265 16% was identified in 24.2% of BRCA1/2 wild_type cases, deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation was identified in an additional 17.2% of cases, and the remaining 58.7% of cases had LOH score < 16% and were BRCA1/2 wild_type (Elvin et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 5512). Among the histological subtypes, LOH score \u2265 16% or BRCA1/2 mutation was reported in 42.4% of serous carcinomas, 37.6% of endometrioid carcinomas, 23.5% of carcinosarcomas, 20.6% of neuroendocrine carcinomas, 13.6% of clear cell carcinomas, and 8.1% of mucinous carcinomas; in BRCA1/2 wild_type samples, the median LOH score was significantly higher in serous as compared with non_serous cases (Elvin et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 5512). In ovarian carcinoma, the median LOH score is significantly higher for BRCA1/2_mutated cases than BRCA1/2 wild_type cases (22.2% vs. 9.8%) (Elvin et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 5512), and mutation or methylation of BRCA1, BRCA2, or RAD51C has been reported to be enriched in cases with increased genomic LOH (Wang et al., 2012; 22912389, Abkevich et al., 2012; 23047548). One study reported no association between LOH and either tumor stage or grade in ovarian serous carcinoma (Marquard et al., 2015; 26015868). In patients with high_grade serous ovarian carcinoma, the frequency of LOH has been reported to increase significantly with age (Pedersen et al., 2013; 23716468). On the basis of emerging clinical data in ovarian cancer, elevated genomic LOH may be associated with greater sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Coleman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5540, Coleman et al., 2017; 28916367, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). In platinum_sensitive, BRCA1/2 wild_type ovarian, peritoneal, or Fallopian tube carcinoma, rucaparib elicited significantly longer median PFS (7.2 vs. 5.0 months, HR=0.51) and improved ORR (33.3% vs. 9.6%, p=0.0003) for patients with LOH score \u2265 16% (Coleman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5540, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). In the maintenance setting in platinum_sensitive, BRCA1/2 wild_type patients, rucaparib was superior to placebo in both the LOH score \u2265 16% (median PFS, 9.7 vs. 5.4 months; HR=0.44) and LOH score < 16% (median PFS, 6.7 vs. 5.4 months; HR=0.58) cohorts (Coleman et al., 2017; 28916367). Similar results have been reported for maintenance treatment with niraparib in ovarian cancer (Mirza et al., 2016; 27717299) when using a different measure of HRD that includes genomic LOH (Telli et al., 2016; 26957554, Timms et al., 2014; 25475740). Increased LOH has also been associated with improved sensitivity to platinum_containing chemotherapy regimens in patients with ovarian or breast cancer (Wang et al., 2012; 22912389, Telli et al., 2015; 25847929, Isakoff et al., 2015; 25847936).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "MUTYH", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "splice site 892_2A>G", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "splice site 892_2A>G"}}, "Interpretation": "MUTYH (also known as MYH) encodes an enzyme involved in DNA base excision repair, and loss of function mutations in MUTYH result in increased rates of mutagenesis and promotion of tumorigenesis (David et al., 2007; 17581577). The two most frequently reported MUTYH loss of function mutations are G382D (also referred to as G396D) and Y165C (also referred to as Y179C) (Molatore et al., 2010; 19953527, Kundu et al., 2009; 19836313, D Agostino et al., 2010; 20418187, Hegde et al., 2014; 24310308, Aretz et al., 2013; 22872101). Numerous other MUTYH mutations have also been shown to result in loss of function (Molatore et al., 2010; 19953527, Kundu et al., 2009; 19836313, Ali et al., 2008; 18534194, D Agostino et al., 2010; 20418187). In general, somatic MUTYH mutations are infrequently reported across cancer types (COSMIC, 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Monoallelic MUTYH mutation occurs in 1_2% of the general population (Hegde et al., 2014; 24310308, Aretz et al., 2013; 22872101). There is conflicting data regarding the impact of monoallelic mutations on the risk of developing CRC (Win et al., 2014; 24444654, Lubbe et al., 2009; 19620482, Jones et al., 2009; 19394335). Patients with MUTYH_mutant CRC were reported to have significantly improved overall survival compared to patients without MUTYH mutation (Nielsen et al., 2010; 21044966). There are no therapies or clinical trials available to address MUTYH alterations in cancer. One or more of the MUTYH variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with MUTYH_associated polyposis (ClinVar, Sep 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline biallelic MUTYH mutation causes MUTYH_associated polyposis (also known as MYH_associated polyposis or MAP), an autosomal recessive condition characterized by multiple colorectal adenomas and increased lifetime risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) (Hegde et al., 2014; 24310308, Sampson et al., 2003; 12853198, Sieber et al., 2003; 12606733, Al_Tassan et al., 2002; 11818965). MAP accounts for approximately 0.7% of all CRC cases and 2% of early_onset CRC cases (Hegde et al., 2014; 24310308). In contrast to CRC, the role of MUTYH mutation in the context of other cancer types is not well established (Rennert et al., 2012; 21952991, Zhang et al., 2006; 16492928, von der Th\u00fcsen et al., 2011; 21189386, Casper et al., 2014; 24420788, Smith et al., 2009; 20110747). Estimates for the prevalence of MAP in the general population range from 1:5,000_1:10,000 (Aretz et al., 2013; 22872101). Therefore, in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of MUTYH is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI_high (MSI_H) has been reported in 1.6_19.7% of ovarian cancer samples (Segev et al., 2015; 26775351, Plisiecka_Ha\u0142asa et al., 2008; 18507046), including 3.8% (1/26) of ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinomas (Huang et al., 2015; 25195947), and 10.0% (3/30) of ovarian clear cell carcinomas (CCOCs) (Strickland et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5514). No association of MSI_H with stage or survival was found in patients with ovarian cancer (Segev et al., 2015; 26775351, Aysal et al., 2012; 22189970). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "00", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "00"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB level associated with lower rates of clinical benefit from treatment with PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors compared with patients with tumors harboring higher TMB levels, based on several studies in multiple solid tumor types (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). Ovarian carcinomas, including peritoneal and Fallopian tube carcinomas, harbor a median TMB of 2.7_3.6 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb) depending upon subtype, and up to 2.1% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). In a study of high grade serous ovarian cancer, homologous recombination (HR)_deficient tumors, which comprised ~50% of all samples, harbored a higher neoantigen load compared to HR_proficient tumors; higher neoantigen load was associated with longer OS but not disease free survival (Strickland et al., 2016; 26871470). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, increased tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Ott et al., 2019; 30557521, Cristescu et al., 2022; 35101941, Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). In the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors, significant improvement in ORR was observed for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) compared with those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526); similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). At the same TMB cutpoint, retrospective analysis of patients with solid tumors treated with any checkpoint inhibitor identified that tissue TMB scores \u2265 10 Muts/Mb were associated with prolonged time to treatment failure compared with scores <10 muts/Mb (HR=0.68) (Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). For patients with solid tumors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the CheckMate 848 trial, improved responses were observed in patients with a tissue TMB \u2265 10 Muts/Mb independent of blood TMB at any cutpoint in matched samples (Schenker at al., 2022; AACR Abstract 7845). However, support for higher TMB thresholds and efficacy was observed in the prospective Phase 2 MyPathway trial of atezolizumab for patients with pan_solid tumors, where improved ORR and DCR was seen in patients with TMB \u2265 16 Muts/Mb than those with TMB \u2265 10 and <16 Muts/Mb (Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409). Similarly, analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": null, "References": {"Reference": [{"number": "0", "ReferenceId": "26337942", "FullCitation": "Kocarnik JM, et al.
