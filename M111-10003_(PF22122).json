CCND2 has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210), and may be biologically relevant in this context (Zack et al., 2013; 24071852, Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). In the TCGA dataset, CCND2 amplification was observed in 3% of glioblastoma cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142) and 7% of lower grade glioma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751). CCND2 amplification has been reported in 3% of primary malignant gliomas in one study, with amplification occurring in one anaplastic astrocytoma and two glioblastoma cases (B\u00fcschges et al., 1999; 10416984). CCND2 mRNA expression has been reported to be increased in higher grade (3 and 4) astrocytoma tumors as compared to lower grade tumors (Kheirollahi et al., 2011; 20077038). Cyclin D2 has been reported to be the main cyclin expressed in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) but was barely detectable in differentiated glioblastoma cells (Koyama_Nasu et al., 2013; 22964630). Cyclin D2, in complex with CDK4/6, has been reported to be involved in the cell cycle progression of undifferentiated GSCs, but not differentiated GSCs, and to be involved in their tumorigenicity (Koyama_Nasu et al., 2013; 22964630). High CCND2 nuclear expression at the time of initial surgery for patients with glioblastoma was reported to significantly associate with early mortality in a multivariate analysis of 72 patients (Bouchart et al., 2019; 31568682). Although preclinical studies suggest that cyclin D2 activates CDK4/6 (Busk et al., 2005; 15707582, Busk, 2003; 12695654), it is unknown whether CCND2 amplification or activating mutation predicts response to CDK4/6 inhibitors such as abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib. Clinical studies of CDK4/6 inhibitors have shown the most promise for estrogen receptor_positive breast cancer (Finn et al., 2014; 25524798, DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "CCND2 amplification or activation may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04282031", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04391595", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02933736", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05159245", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03994796", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02981940", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05252416", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02896335", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03310879", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "CDK4", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "CDK4 encodes the cyclin_dependent kinase 4, which regulates the cell cycle, senescence, and apoptosis (reviewed in Choi et al., 2014; 23644662). CDK4 and its functional homolog CDK6 are activated by D_type cyclins and promote cell cycle progression by inactivating the tumor suppressor Rb (Weinberg et al., 1995; 7736585, Musgrove et al., 2011; 21734724). Amplification of the chromosomal region that includes CDK4 has been reported in multiple cancer types, including lung cancer, glioblastoma, and liposarcoma, and has been associated with overexpression of CDK4 protein (Wikman et al., 2005; 15543620, Rao et al., 2010; 19609742, Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Chung et al., 2009; 19574885, Ragazzini et al., 2004; 15024701, Dujardin et al., 2011; 21336260, Zhang et al., 2013; 23393200, Horvai et al., 2009; 19734852). CDK4 amplification has been observed in 9.4% of glioma cases (cBio_Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031). A study has reported amplification of the 12q14_15 region, where CDK4 and MDM2 reside, in 4.8% (2/42) of glioblastomas (Zheng et al., 2013; 23796897). Amplification of CDK4 and corresponding increased CDK4 protein expression has been reported to be associated with a poorer patient outcome in anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma (Kim et al., 2010; 20080666, Ruano et al., 2009; 19141386, Fischer et al., 2008; 18403636, B\u00e4cklund et al., 2005; 15970925).

Clinical benefit has been reported for limited tumor types including patients with CDK4_amplified liposarcoma and sarcoma in response to treatment with abemaciclib (Dickson et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 11004), palbociclib (Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Dickson et al., 2016; 27124835), and ribociclib (Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04282031", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03239015", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04391595", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02933736", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05159245", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03994796", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02981940", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05252416", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02896335", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "IDH1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "R132H", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "R132H"}}, "Interpretation": "The isocitrate dehydrogenases IDH1 and IDH2 encode highly homologous enzymes that are involved in the citric acid (TCA) cycle and other metabolic processes, playing roles in normal cellular metabolism and in protection against oxidative stress and apoptosis (Reitman and Yan, 2010; 20513808). R132 is located within the active site of IDH1 and is a hotspot for mutations in cancer (Jin et al., 2011; 21326614, Gross et al., 2010; 20142433, Ward et al., 2010; 20171147, Leonardi et al., 2012; 22442146, Reitman and Yan, 2010; 20513808). Substitutions at IDH1 R132 alter the enzymatic activity of IDH1, resulting in the production of the oncometabolite, D_2_hydroxyglutarate (2_HG)(Dang et al., 2009; 19935646, Ward et al., 2012; 21996744, Ward et al., 2010; 20171147, Gross et al., 2010; 20142433, Leonardi et al., 2012; 22442146), which promotes tumorigenesis (Gross et al., 2010; 20142433, Figueroa et al., 2010; 21130701, Xu et al., 2011; 21251613, Turcan et al., 2012; 22343889, Duncan et al., 2012; 22899282). IDH1 mutation is characteristic of low_grade gliomas and secondary glioblastoma, and is relatively rare in primary glioblastoma (Chaumeil et al., 2013; 24019001, Hartmann et al., 2013; 23918605, Rossetto et al., 2011; 21885076, Shin et al., 2013; 24129546, Parsons et al., 2008; 18772396). In the TCGA datasets, IDH1 mutation has been found in 77% of lower grade glioma cases and in 5% of glioblastoma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751, cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). IDH1/2 mutations are a strong favorable prognostic marker for OS in Grade 2_3 glioma, particularly in combination with 1p/19q codeletion (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022). Several studies have found IDH1 mutations to be associated with improved prognosis and longer PFS and OS in patients with various types of glioma including anaplastic astrocytoma and GBM (Hartmann et al., 2010; 21088844, Sonoda et al., 2009; 19765000, Ahmadi et al., 2012; 22528790, Jiang et al., 2013; 23486687, Shibahara et al., 2012; 21971842, Parsons et al., 2008; 18772396, Juratli et al., 2012; 23015095, Weller et al., 2009; 19805672). IDH1 mutations that lead to production of 2_HG, most commonly R132 alterations, may predict sensitivity to IDH1_mutation_specific inhibitors such as ivosidenib (Abou_Alfa et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA10, Fan et al., 2019; 31028664, Mellinghoff et al., 2017; SNO Abstract ACTR_46, Tap et al., 2016; CTOS Abstract P1_138). A Phase 1b/2 study of the IDH1 inhibitor olutasidenib for patients with IDH1_mutated glioma reported a DCR of 50% (n=24) with 1 PR (De La Fuente et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 2505). A Phase 1 study of the pan_IDH1/IDH2 inhibitor vorasidenib for patients with IDH1_ or IDH2_mutated glioma reported an ORR of 18.2% (4/22; RANO criteria) and median PFS of 31.4 months for non_enhancing cases and median PFS of 7.5 months for the overall glioma population (n=52) (Mellinghoff et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 2504). Preclinical studies suggested that IDH1 neomorphic mutations may also confer sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Philip et al., 2018; 29719265, Molenaar et al., 2018; 29339439, Lu et al., 2017; 28202508, Sulkowski et al., 2017; 28148839). In a Phase 1 trial of the PD_L1 inhibitor atezolizumab for patients with glioblastoma (GBM), 2/3 patients with IDH1_mutated tumors experienced clinical benefit (1 PR, 1 long_term SD, 1 short_term SD), whereas none of the 8 patients with IDH1_wildtype GBM experienced benefit (8/8 PD); significantly longer PFS and a trend toward longer OS were observed for patients with IDH1_mutated tumors compared with the patients with IDH1_wildtype tumors (Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642). A Phase 1 trial of the oral brain_penetrant mutated IDH1 selective inhibitor DS_1001 for patients with recurrent or progressive IDH1_mutated glioma reported 2 CRs and 4 PRs for 35 patients with enhancing tumors and 1 PR and 3 minor responses (MRs) for 12 patients with non_enhancing tumors (Natsume et al., 2022; 35722822). Preclinical data indicate that IDH1_mutated glioma may be sensitive to the glutaminase inhibitor telaglenastat in combination with radiotherapy (McBrayer et al., 2018; 30220459, Kizilbash et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract TPS2075). IDH1/2 mutations are associated with improved survival outcomes for patients with glioma treated with radiation or alkylating chemotherapy (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022). Addition of procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (PCV) to radiotherapy significantly improved OS for patients with IDH_mutated (9.4 vs. 5.7 years, HR=0.59) but not IDH_non_mutated (1.3 versus 1.8 years, HR=1.14) anaplastic oligodendroglioma/oligoastrocytoma (Cairncross et al., 2014; 24516018). As adjuvant therapy after radiation for patients with IDH1/2_mutated anaplastic astrocytoma, temozolomide (van den Bent et al., 2021; 34000245) or PCV (Esteyrie et al., 2021; 33524191) improved median PFS and median OS relative to radiotherapy or temozolomide alone, respectively. IDH mutation in the absence of TERT mutation is suggestive of astrocytoma (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022)(Weller et al., 2020; 33293629). IDH1/2 mutation is associated with Grade 2 and 3 astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, with the latter also harboring 1p19q deletion, and distinguishes secondary glioblastoma (GBM) from primary GBM (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022). ATRX mutations often co_occur with IDH1/2 mutations and may be indicative of Grade 2_3 astrocytoma or secondary glioblastoma (GBM) (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022)(Louis et al., 2016; 27157931, Weller et al., 2020; 33293629).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "IDH1 mutations may predict sensitivity to IDH1 inhibitors.

Activating mutations in RAS genes can cause uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor formation (Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Kahn et al., 1987; 3310850). In numerous cancer type_specific studies as well as a large_scale pan_cancer analysis, KRAS amplification was shown to correlate with increased expression (McIntyre et al., 2005; 16354586, Mita et al., 2009; 19545448, Birkeland et al., 2012; 23099803, Chen et al., 2014; 24874471). Additionally, KRAS amplification correlated with sensitivity of cancer cell lines to KRAS knockdown, suggesting that amplified KRAS is an oncogenic driver (Chen et al., 2014; 24874471). In the TCGA dataset, KRAS mutations or amplification was detected in 1.8% of glioblastomas (GBM)(cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142) and 2.8% of lower grade gliomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751). In other studies KRAS mutations were observed in 2 out of 125 pilocytic astrocytomas, 1 out 25 grade 1 and 2 astrocytomas (Cin et al., 2011; 21424530, Janzarik et al., 2007; 17712732), and 2 out of 94 patients with GBM (Knobbe et al., 2004; 15517309). While the importance of RAS signaling in astrocytomas has been established, there is very little information regarding clinical implications of KRAS alterations in human astrocytoma (Mellinghoff et al., 2011; 22015553, Cin et al., 2011; 21424530). In mouse models of cancer, activating KRAS mutation in combination with AKT mutation was sufficient to induce GBM in astrocytes and neural progenitors (Holland et al., 2000; 10802656). Furthermore, mutant KRAS_driven signaling was required for the maintenance of mouse GBM tumors (Holmen and Williams, 2005; 16166301), suggesting that targeting KRAS signaling may be an appropriate therapeutic strategy in KRAS_driven GBMs. Preclinical evidence suggests that KRAS activation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, such as trametinib, binimetinib, cobimetinib, and selumetinib (Nakano et al., 1984; 6320174, Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Yamaguchi et al., 2011; 21523318, Watanabe et al., 2013; 23438367, Gilmartin et al., 2011; 21245089, Yeh et al., 2009; 19372556). Clinical evidence that KRAS amplification in the absence of a concurrent KRAS activating mutation is sensitive to MEK inhibitors is limited. A Phase 2 study of selumetinib plus docetaxel in patients with gastric cancer reported 1/2 patients with KRAS amplification experienced a PR (Lee et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 4061).

The PDGFRA juxtamembrane (JM) domain has been reported to inhibit PDGFRA kinase activity (Stover et al., 2006; 16690743), and multiple alterations to the PDGFRA JM domain, including S566_E571>R and V561_I562insE, have been shown to be activating and sensitive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib (Hirota et al., 2003; 12949711, Heinrich et al., 2003; 12522257, Corless et al., 2005; 15928335, Medeiros et al., 2004; 15223958). PDGFRA amplification has been suggested to be more common in higher grade astrocytomas than in lower grade astrocytomas; studies have reported PDGFRA amplification in 16.3% (27/166) of Grade 2 astrocytomas and in 23.6% (91/386) of Grade 3 and 4 astrocytomas analyzed (Holtkamp et al., 2007; 17504929, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035, Motomura et al., 2013; 23242283). PDGFRA amplification has been reported in 5.2_33% of glioblastoma cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Nobusawa et al., 2011; 21382095, Joensuu et al., 2005; 16021678, Alentorn et al., 2012; 23074200). PDGFRA mutation has been identified in 5.6% of Grade 3 and 5.4% of Grade 4 astrocytomas, 2.4% of Grade 3 oligodendrogliomas, and 12% (3/25) of gliosarcomas analyzed in COSMIC (Feb 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). PDGFRA mutations have been reported in 0_5% of lower grade glioma and glioblastoma samples (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890, cBio_Hoadley et al., 2018; 29625048, cBio_Ellrott et al., 2018; 29596782, cBio_Taylor et al., 2018; 29622463, cBio_Gao et al., 2018; 29617662, cBio_Liu et al., 2018; 29625055, cBio_Sanchez_Vega et al., 2018; 29625050), Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751, cBio_Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, cBio_Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509, cBio_Jones et al., 2013; 23817572). A retrospective analysis of TCGA glioma samples reported elevated expression of ERBB3 correlated with PDGFRA expression and co_expression of these genes was an indicator of poor prognosis in a GBM patient cohort (Song et al., 2018; 29888103). Amplification of PDGFRA has been associated with tumor grade and poor progression_free and overall survival in patients with glioblastoma (Alentorn et al., 2012; 23074200, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035). In addition, PDGFRA amplification has been reported to occur in conjunction with IDH1 mutation in glioblastoma, and both alterations in the same tumor have been associated with poor patient prognosis (Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035). Amplification of PDGFRA has also been strongly correlated with the presence of KDR and/or KIT amplification in glioblastomas, as well as with EGFR amplification (Joensuu et al., 2005; 16021678, Holtkamp et al., 2007; 17504929, Puputti et al., 2006; 17189383, Szerlip et al., 2012; 22323597). On the basis of extensive clinical evidence in solid tumors and hematologic cancers, PDGFRA activating alterations are associated with sensitivity to imatinib (Arefi et al., 2012; 22806436, Baccarani et al., 2007; 17666373, Cassier et al., 2012; 22718859, Chalmers et al., 2015; 25658984, Cools et al., 2003; 12660384, Curtis et al., 2007; 17555450, Debiec_Rychter et al., 2016; 15010069, Dileo et al., 2011; 20473908, Fanta et al., 2015; 24638008, Florian et al., 2006; 16406018, Frenard et al., 2016; 27051816, Griffin et al., 2003; 12808148, Heinrich et al., 2003; 14645423, Helbig et al., 2009; 19120352, Helbig et al., 2014; 24009127, Hus et al., 2011; 21093052, Ikezoe et al., 2010; 20303172, Intermesoli et al., 2009; 19735261, Jain et al., 2009; 19013640, Jovanovic et al., 2007; 17299092, Kang et al., 2012; 22150077, Klion et al., 2004; 14504092, Kobayashi et al., 2009; 19192229, Koc\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al., 2014; 24635438, Metzgeroth et al., 2008; 18950453, Murayama et al., 2012; 22645636, Ogbogu et al., 2009; 19910029, Ohnishi et al., 2006; 16856885, Pardanani et al., 2003; 12842979, Pardanani et al., 2004; 15284118, Qu et al., 2016; 27120808, Score et al., 2006; 16498388, Shah et al., 2011; 24669761, Sugimoto et al., 2015; 26319757, Volz et al., 2011; 20609486, von Bubnoff et al., 2005; 15618966, Walz et al., 2006; 16845659, Yoo et al., 2016; 26130666). Sorafenib has shown clinical and preclinical activity against the FIP1L1_PDGFRA fusion in chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) and mutations associated with clinical resistance to imatinib and sunitinib in both CEL and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)(Fumagalli et al., 2012; ESMO Abstract 1491P, Al_Riyami et al., 2013; 23157309, Lierman et al., 2006; 16645167, Lierman et al., 2009; 19212337, Metzgeroth et al., 2012; 21818111, Roubaud et al., 2012; 22294526, Von Bubnoff et al., 2011; 20972453). Complete responses to nilotinib have been reported in patients with CEL or hypereosinophilic syndrome with FIP1L1_PDGFRA or activating mutations (Hochhaus et al., 2013; 24057647, Ikezoe et al., 2010; 20303172, Tabouret et al., 2011; 20832858); preclinical evidence has reported efficacy of nilotinib in the context of PDGFRA mutations associated with GIST (Dewaele et al., 2008; 18794084, Weisberg et al., 2006; 17087936). Patients with GIST harboring PDGFRA activating mutations have been reported to derive clinical benefit from treatment with sunitinib (Heinrich et al., 2006; ASCO Abstract 9502, Brohl et al., 2015; 26396737) or regorafenib (Grellety et al., 2015; 28031906, Kollar et al., 2014; 25905001). Preclinical studies have reported sensitivity of activating PDGFRA mutations and FIP1L1_PDGFRA fusion to dasatinib (Dewaele et al., 2008; 18794084, Lierman et al., 2009; 19212337). PDGFRA D842 mutations were reported to be sensitive to avapritinib in clinical (Heinrich et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 11011, Evans et al., 2017; 29093181) and preclinical (Evans et al., 2017; 29093181) studies of GIST, and demonstrated sensitivity to ripretinib for 1 patient (Jaku et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 2515).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PDGFRA amplification may predict sensitivity to imatinib and to anti_PDGFRA antibodies.

A Phase 1/2 trial of temsirolimus in combination with sorafenib in patients with glioblastoma was terminated at the Phase 2 interim analysis after patients failed to meet the primary endpoint of 6 month progression_free survival (Lee et al., 2012; 23099651).

RNF43 and the homologous E3 ubiquitin ligase ZNRF3 are tumor suppressors that function as negative regulators of WNT signaling (Hao et al., 2012; 22575959, Koo et al., 2012; 22895187, Jiang et al., 2013; 23847203, Koo et al., 2015; 26023187, Tsukiyama et al., 2015; 25825523). An additional tumor_suppressor_like role for RNF43 in colon cancer is hypothesized to occur via its interaction with the ubiquitin_protein ligase NEDL1, which is predicted to enhance the pro_apoptotic effects of p53 (Shinada et al., 2011; 21108931). Mutations in RNF43 have been reported in 18_27% of endometrial cancers (Kinde et al., 2013; 23303603, Giannakis et al., 2014; 25344691), 3_5% of pancreatic cancers (Madan and Virshup, 2015; 25901018), 21% of ovarian mucinous carcinomas (Ryland et al., 2013; 23096461), 9% of liver fluke_associated cholangiocarcinomas (Ong et al., 2012; 22561520), and up to 18% of colorectal cancers (Giannakis et al., 2014; 25344691, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696). RNF43 mutations are associated with mismatch repair deficiency and microsatellite instability (MSI) in colorectal (Giannakis et al., 2014; 25344691), endometrial (Giannakis et al., 2014; 25344691), and gastric cancers (Wang et al., 2014; 24816253, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317); one study reported RNF43 alterations in more than 50% of MSI gastric carcinomas (Wang et al., 2014; 24816253). Preclinical studies have reported that RNF43 is a negative regulator of WNT signaling, and RNF43 loss or inactivation leads to WNT activation and confers sensitivity to WNT pathway inhibitors, particularly Porcupine inhibitors, in multiple tumor types (Hao et al., 2012; 22575959, Koo et al., 2012; 22895187, Jiang et al., 2013; 23847203, Koo et al., 2015; 26023187, Tsukiyama et al., 2015; 25825523, Cook et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 517MO). In a Phase 1 basket study for the Porcupine inhibitor RXC004, 1 of 2 patients with tumors harboring an RNF43 mutation achieved SD (Cook et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 517MO). Of the patients with WNT_ligand_dependent tumors, including those with RNF43 mutations, RSPO fusions, or those with biliary tract or thymus cancer, 71% (5/7) experienced SD (Cook et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 517MO).

ATRX inactivation or loss of expression is associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)(Lovejoy et al., 2012; 22829774, Bower et al, 2012; 23185534; Heaphy et al., 2011; 21719641, Liau et al., 2015; 25229770). Alterations that disrupt the ADD domain (aa 167_270) or helicase domain (aa 2010_2280) of ATRX are predicted to result in loss of ATRX function (Nan et al., 2007; 17296936, Garrick et al., 2004; 14729260, Eustermann et al., 2011; 21666677); however, the loss of ATRX function is not sufficient to induce ALT, which requires other undetermined factors (Clynes et al., 2013; 23916100, Flynn et al., 2015; 25593184). Germline mutations in ATRX give rise to alpha_thalassemia X_linked intellectual disability syndrome (ATR_X syndrome)(Gibbons et al., 1995; 7697714). Somatic mutation of ATRX has been reported in a number of solid tumor types, often associated with ALT (Heaphy et al., 2011; 21719641). ATRX mutation correlating with ALT has been reported in 10_20% of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs)(Singhi et al., 2015; USCAP Abstract 1797)(Jiao et al., 2011; 21252315, Heaphy et al., 2011; 21719641), 12.6% of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (Fishbein et al., 2015; 25608029), and 48% of adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with glioblastoma (GBM) or neuroblastoma (Morosini et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 11008)(Cheung et al., 2012; 22416102, Molenaar et al., 2012; 22367537, Pugh et al., 2013; 23334666, Cheung and Dyer, 2013; 23702928). ATRX loss in PNET (Singhi et al., 2015; USCAP Abstract 1797)(Marinoni et al., 2014; 24148618) and melanoma (Qadeer et al., 2014; 24468746) and mutation in other neuroendocrine tumors (Fishbein et al., 2015; 25608029) is associated with poor prognosis. Pediatric patients with high_grade glioma and ATRX mutation were shown to have more aggressive disease but are more responsive to treatment with double_strand break therapy (Koschmann et al., 2016; 26936505). ATRX mutation or loss of expression is more frequent in Grade 2/3 astrocytoma and secondary GBM than primary GBM, oligodendroglioma, and oligoastrocytoma (Kannan et al., 2012; 23104868, Haberler and W\u00f6hrer, 2014; 24559763, Reuss et al., 2014; 25427834, Sahm et al., 2014; 25143301) and has been proposed as a distinguishing biomarker (Haberler and W\u00f6hrer, 2014; 24559763, Reuss et al., 2014; 25427834, Sahm et al., 2014; 25143301). ATRX mutation has not been detected in concurrence with MYCN amplification in glioma and neuroblastoma (Cheung et al., 2012; 22416102, Molenaar et al., 2012; 22367537, Pugh et al., 2013; 23334666, Cheung and Dyer, 2013; 23702928). Low_grade gliomas with both IDH1/2 mutation and ATRX mutation are associated with worse prognosis than those with IDH1/2 mutation but no ATRX mutation (Haberler and W\u00f6hrer, 2014; 24559763). Loss of ATRX protein expression has been reported in 33_39% of incidences of leiomyosarcoma (LMS) associating with ALT, a poor prognostic factor across all LMS subtypes, and with poor prognosis in extrauterine LMS but not in uterine LMS (Singhi et al., 2015; USCAP Abstract 93)(Liau et al., 2015; 25229770). No targeted therapies are available to directly address ATRX inactivation. Based on preclinical (Liang et al., 2020; 31551363, Garbarino et al., 2021; 34118569) and limited clinical data (Cole et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT059), ATRX alterations may confer sensitivity to combination strategies involving WEE1 inhibition. In a Phase 2 study evaluating the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib plus irinotecan for the treatment of pediatric patients with neuroblastoma, prolonged SD was reported for 44% (4/9) of patients with ATRX_deficient tumors and responses were seen in two tumors that had evidence of ALT (Cole et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT059). Preclinical evidence also suggests that ATRX deficiency may impart sensitivity to synthetic lethal approaches involving PARP inhibition and irinotecan (George et al., 2020; 32846370), combined PARP and ATR inhibition (Garbarino et al., 2021; 34118569), or double_strand break_induction with agents such as doxorubicin, irinotecan, and topotecan (Koschmann et al., 2016; 26936505); however, these approaches have not been demonstrated clinically. ATRX mutations often co_occur with IDH1/2 mutations and may be indicative of Grade 2_3 astrocytoma or secondary glioblastoma (GBM) (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022)(Louis et al., 2016; 27157931, Weller et al., 2020; 33293629).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "FGF23", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "FGF23 encodes a member of the fibroblast growth factor protein family that plays a central role in phosphate homeostasis (Jonsson et al., 2003; 12711740).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947).

In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "RAD21", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "RAD21 encodes a protein involved in DNA double_strand break repair and sister chromatid cohesion as a part of the cohesin complex (Xu et al., 2011; 21326324, Hill et al., 2016; 27207471, Solomon et al., 2014; 24856830, Bauerschmidt et al., 2010; 19906707). In preclinical studies, downregulation of RAD21 or other cohesin components leads to loss of expression from amplified genes, as well as amplifications themselves upon cell passaging (Yun et al., 2016; 26420833), but also leads to an increase in deletions, insertions, and other rearrangements (Gelot et al., 2016; 27326661). High RAD21 expression has also been associated with increased genomic instability (Yan et al., 2012; 22537934). Cohesin complex also organizes chromatin domains and regulates gene expression (Sofueva et al., 2013; 24185899, Deng et al., 2012; 23010778). Both overexpression and reduction of expression of RAD21 has been reported to alter gene expression (Yun et al., 2016; 27466323). RAD21 amplification has been correlated with increased expression in breast (Yan et al., 2012; 22537934, Xu et al., 2011; 21255398, Mahmood et al., 2014; 24148822) and endometrial (Supernat et al., 2012; 23205091) cancers. Other RAD21 alterations, including truncating and point mutations, have been reported in the context of cancer, but the majority have not been characterized. RAD21 amplifications have been reported in solid tumors, including breast cancers (7%), melanoma (5.4%), and prostate (2.4%) cancers (cBio_Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359). RAD21 overexpression has been correlated with poor prognosis in endometrial cancer (Supernat et al., 2012; 23205091), breast cancer (Xu et al., 2011; 21255398, Sharaf et al., 2022; 35227290), Ewing sarcoma (Su et al., 2021; 33766983), and colorectal cancer (CRC), especially in KRAS_mutant CRC (Deb et al., 2014; 24548858).

Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). In the TCGA dataset, TP53 alterations have been reported in 35% of glioblastomas (GBMs), with a high incidence in pediatric and secondary GBMs and a low incidence in primary GBMs (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890, Jha et al., 2011; 22089350). One study detected TP53 alterations in 31% (73/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed, with most of the events being mutations (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). TP53 mutations have been reported in 18_40% of astrocytoma samples, and preferentially in anaplastic astrocytoma; one study reported TP53 loss of function and partially/fully functional mutations in 15% and 25% of anaplastic astrocytomas, respectively (Uno et al., 2005; 15914282, Uno et al., 2006; 16711514, Lass et al., 2012; 22844452, Faria et al., 2012; 23009112, Milinkovic et al., 2013; 24358143, Galatro et al., 2013; 23613880). Some studies suggest that the presence of a TP53 mutation is correlated with a favorable prognosis in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) (Schmidt et al., 2002; 11939587). One study reported that TP53 alterations were associated with poorer OS (12.9 months altered vs. 19.7 months wildtype, HR=1.58, p=0.0054) in IDH_wildtype GBM (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Mutation of TP53 is thought to be an early step in the tumorigenesis of astrocytomas, which can progress into anaplastic astrocytoma and then glioblastoma through gain of other genetic abnormalities such as loss of CDKN2A or RB1, followed by loss of PTEN (Nozaki et al., 1999; 11550308). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "01", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "01"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Touat et al., 2020; 32322066, Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556, Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642). Glioblastoma (GBM) harbors a median TMB of 2.7 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 4.2% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). For pediatric patients, high TMB has been reported in a subset of high_grade gliomas, frequently in association with mutations in mismatch repair or proofreading genes and in TP53, whereas BRAF alterations or other oncogene fusions were observed more frequently in brain tumors harboring low TMB (Patel et al., 2020; 32386112, Johnson et al., 2017; 28912153). Increased TMB has been reported to correlate with higher tumor grade in glioma (Draaisma et al., 2015; 26699864) and glioblastoma (GBM) tissue samples with biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD) (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570), as well as with shorter OS of patients with diffuse glioma (Wang et al., 2020; 32164609). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In glioma, a lack of association between TMB and clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors has been reported (Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Touat et al., 2020; 32322066). However, multiple case studies have reported that patients with ultramutated gliomas driven by POLE mutations have benefited from treatment with anti_PD_1 (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556) or anti_PD_L1 (Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642) therapies. Therefore, although increased TMB alone may not be a strong biomarker for PD_1 or PD_L1 inhibitors in this cancer type, these agents may have efficacy for patients with glioma harboring both high TMB
