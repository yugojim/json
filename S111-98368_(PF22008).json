FBXW7 inactivation is associated with chromosomal instability and with stabilization of proto_oncogenes, such as mTOR, MYC, cyclin E, NOTCH, and JUN; FBXW7 is therefore considered a tumor suppressor (Akhoondi et al., 2007; 17909001, Welcker and Clurman, 2008; 18094723). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt FBXW7 function or expression (Welcker et al., 2013; 24298052, Welcker et al., 2007; 17298674, Strohmaier et al., 2001; 11565034, Pashkova et al., 2010; 21070969, Akhoondi et al., 2007; 17909001, O Neil et al., 2007; 17646409, Malyukova et al., 2013; 23228967, Thompson et al., 2007; 17646408).

FBXW7 has been reported to be the fourth most commonly mutated gene in colorectal cancer, with mutations in 6_10% of cases in the scientific literature (Kemp et al., 2005; 16357143, Rajagopalan et al., 2004; 14999283, Grim et al., 2012; 22473991). Low FBXW7 mRNA levels are associated with poor patient prognosis, and FBXW7 inactivation in colorectal cancer has been associated with chromosomal instability (Rajagopalan et al., 2004; 14999283, Iwatsuki et al., 2010; 19739118). FBXW7 inactivating alterations may indicate sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors (Mao et al., 2008; 18787170, Yang et al., 2015; 25749036). Several case studies reported clinical benefit for patients with FBXW7_mutated cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma (Villaruz and Socinski, 2014; 24360397), renal cell carcinoma (Olson et al., 2016; 27079472), and cervical squamous cell carcinoma (Kulkarni et al., 2020; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygyno.2020.05.244). Multiple clinical studies report that inhibitors of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway have not produced significant clinical benefit as monotherapies to treat CRC, even for tumors that harbor alterations in PIK3CA or PTEN; data are more limited for alterations in other genes in this pathway (Ng et al., 2013; 23743569, Ganesan et al., 2013; 24092809, Janku et al., 2014; 24440717).

Mutations in KRAS have been reported in approximately 35_50% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) (Lievre et al., 2006; 16618717, De Roock et al., 2011; 21163703, Chen et al., 2014; 25367198, Li et al., 2015; 25929517, Hu et al., 2016; 27977612, Zekri et al., 2017; 28218784, Staudacher et al., 2017; 29048416, Wang et al., 2018; 29705968, Guo et al., 2018; 29666387). Numerous studies have reported that KRAS mutations are associated with increased metastasis, adverse clinicopathological features, and shorter survival of patients with CRC (Chen et al., 2014; 25367198, Li et al., 2015; 25929517, Hu et al., 2016; 27977612, M\u00e1rmol et al., 2017; 28106826, Zekri et al., 2017; 28218784, Kwak et al., 2017; 28858102). Preclinical evidence suggests that KRAS activation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, such as trametinib, binimetinib, cobimetinib, and selumetinib (Nakano et al., 1984; 6320174, Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Yamaguchi et al., 2011; 21523318, Watanabe et al., 2013; 23438367, Gilmartin et al., 2011; 21245089, Yeh et al., 2009; 19372556). However, multiple clinical trials have reported lack of efficacy of trametinib and other MEK inhibitors when used as monotherapy for treatment of patients with KRAS_mutant CRC (Tsimberidou et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract e22086)(Infante et al., 2012; 22805291, Zimmer et al., 2014; 24947927, Bennouna et al., 2011; 20127139, Weekes et al., 2013; 23434733). Both clinical (Hochster et al., 2013; ASCO GI Abstract 380, Juric et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 9051) and preclinical (Lamba et al., 2014; 25199829, Sun et al, 2014; 24685132) studies suggest that combinatorial approaches including MEK inhibitors are likely to be more effective for the treatment of CRC, including strategies such as combination of MEK inhibitors with PI3K inhibitors (Juric et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 9051), RAF inhibitors (Lamba et al., 2014; 25199829), pan_ERBB inhibitors (Sun et al, 2014; 24685132), or chemotherapeutic agents (Hochster et al., 2013; ASCO GI Abstract 380). In a Phase 1 study evaluating the MEK_pan_RAF dual inhibitor CH5126766, 6 patients harboring KRAS mutations experienced PRs, including 3 with non_small cell lung cancer (NCSLC), 1 with low_grade serous ovarian carcinoma (LGSOC), 1 with endometrial adenocarcinoma, and 1 with multiple myeloma (Guo et al., 2020; 33128873). Combination of CH5126766 with the FAK inhibitor defactinib elicited PR rates of 50% (4/8) for patients with KRAS_mutated low_grade serous ovarian cancer and 12% (2/17) for patients with KRAS_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a Phase 1 study (Krebs et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT019, Shinde et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT143). Preclinical and clinical data suggest that KRAS mutations may predict clinical benefit from SHP2 inhibitors (Lu et al., 2019; 31068384, Mainardi et al., 2018; 29808006, Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001, Brana et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3005, Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). A Phase 1 study of RMC_4630 for relapsed/refractory solid tumors reported a DCR of 58% (23/40) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS mutations and a DCR of 75% (12/16) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS G12C mutations (Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001). Interim results from a Phase 1/2 study of RMC_4630 plus cobimetinib reported tumor reduction in 3 of 8 patients with KRAS_mutated colorectal cancer (Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). Preclinical data suggest that KRAS mutation may confer sensitivity to SOS1 inhibitors (Hillig et al., 2019; 30683722, Hofmann et al., 2021; 32816843, Gerlach et al., 2020; AACR Abstract 1091). Phase 1 studies of the SOS1 inhibitor BI 1701963 alone or in combination with MEK inhibitors, KRAS G12C inhibitors, or irinotecan are recruiting for patients with solid tumors harboring KRAS mutations (Hofmann et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT210, Gort et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract TPS3651). Preclinical and limited clinical evidence suggest that KRAS mutation may predict sensitivity to PLK1 inhibitors (Luo et al., 2009; 19490893, Lenz et al., 2020; ASCO GI Abstract TPS265). A Phase 1b/2 study of PLK1 inhibitor onvansertib in combination with FOLFIRI and bevacizumab for patients with KRAS_mutated metastatic CRC previously treated with chemotherapy reported an 87.5% (7/8; 3 PR, 4 SD) clinical benefit rate, with 1 patient going on to successful curative surgery (Barzi et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT235). Activating mutations in KRAS or NRAS are associated with lack of clinical benefit from cetuximab (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Bokemeyer et al., 2011; 21228335, Karapetis et al., 2008; 18946061, De Roock et al., 2008; 17998284) or panitumumab (Douillard et al., 2014; 24718886, Douillard et al., 2012; 24024839, Amado et al., 2008; 18316791) for patients with CRC.

It is an oncogene and may be activated in as many as 20% of cancers (Dang et al., 2006; 16904903). MYC dysregulation (amplification, overexpression, translocation) has been identified in a number of different cancer types (Nesbit et al., 1999; 10378696). MYC amplification has been significantly linked with increased mRNA and protein levels and results in the dysregulation of a large number of target genes (Blancato et al., 2004; 15083194, Dang et al., 2006; 16904903, Fromont et al., 2013; 23574779). Mutation and amplification of MYC have been observed in up to 2% and 5% of patients with colorectal cancer, respectively (cBioPortal, COSMIC, Sep 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Overexpression of MYC in colorectal carcinoma has been reported to occur in the absence of MYC amplification (Erisman et al., 1985; 3837853, Erisman et al., 1988; 3283655, Wang et al., 1994; 8086630). MYC is a target gene of beta_catenin and may be upregulated by aberrant WNT signaling in colorectal cancer (Herbst et al., 2014; 24467841). MYC overexpression has been reported in 62_91% of colorectal carcinomas studied (Huang et al., 2013; 24240588, Toon et al., 2014; 24503701, Erisman et al., 1985; 3837853, Wang et al., 1994; 8086630). MYC protein overexpression was reported to be a favorable prognostic biomarker in patients with colorectal cancer, and patients with low_level MYC amplification have been found to have significantly longer survival (Toon et al., 2014; 24503701, Augenlicht et al., 1997; 9135021). However, MYC amplification and high expression have been associated with metastatic and aggressive colorectal tumors (Wang et al., 1994; 8086630, Monnat et al., 1987; 3040597). There are no available therapies that directly target MYC. However, preclinical data indicate that MYC overexpression may predict sensitivity to investigational agents targeting CDK1 (Horiuchi et al., 2012; 22430491, Goga et al., 2007; 17589519), CDK2 (Molenaar et al., 2009; 19525400), Aurora kinase A (Dammert et al., 2019; 31375684, Mollaoglu et al., 2017; 28089889, Robert et al., 2017; 29088717, Wang et al., 2017; 28417568, Takahashi et al., 2015; 25632068, Li et al., 2018; 30226440, Kong et al., 2017; DOI: 10.21037/tcr.2017.06.41, Mahadeva et al.,2014; 24893165, Park et al., 2019; 31429028), Aurora kinase B (Helfrich et al., 2016; 27496133, Hook et al., 2012; 22222631, Yang et al., 2010; 20643922, He et al., 2019; 30540594), glutaminase (Shroff et al., 2015; 25964345, Effenberger et al., 2017; 29156762, Shen et al., 2018; 30103944, Xiang et al., 2015; 25915584), or BET bromodomain_containing proteins (Delmore et al., 2011; 21889194, Bandopadhayay et al., 2013; 24297863, Loven et al., 2013; 23582323, Otto et al., 2019; 31734632), as well as agents targeting both HDAC and PI3K (Dong et al., 2013; 23866964, Pei et al., 2016; 26977882; Fu et al., 2019; 30224636). A Phase 2 study reported a PFS benefit associated with a combination of the Aurora A kinase inhibitor alisertib and paclitaxel as second_line therapy for patients with MYC_overexpressed small cell lung cancer but not for patients without MYC overexpression (Simmons et al., 2020; 31655296). A patient with MYC_amplified invasive ductal breast carcinoma experienced a PR to an Aurora kinase inhibitor (Ganesan et al., 2014; 25253784). The glutaminase inhibitor CB_839, in combination with either everolimus or cabozantinib, has demonstrated encouraging efficacy in Phase 1 and 2 studies enrolling patients with pretreated advanced renal cell carcinoma (Tannir et al., 2018; ASCO GU Abstract 603, Motzer et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA54). MYC amplification has also been suggested to predict response to chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer in some studies (Pereira et al., 2013; 23555992, Yasojima et al., 2011; 21741827). Preclinical evidence suggests that colon cancer cells with MYC amplification may be more sensitive to 5_fluorouracil and paclitaxel (Arango et al., 2001; 11406570, Bottone et al., 2003; 14516787).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "MYC overexpression may predict sensitivity to inhibition of CDKs, especially CDK1 and CDK2, of Aurora kinases, including Aurora kinase A and B, and of BET domain proteins, which are reported to downregulate MYC expression and MYC_dependent transcriptional programs.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT03220347", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03297424", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04555837", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT01434316", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS colorectal cancers (CRCs) make up 70_85% of CRC cases (Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894). MSS colorectal cancers are molecularly heterogeneous, driven by diverse mechanisms such as extensive DNA methylation, oncogenic mutations in KRAS or BRAF, or chromosomal instability (Jass, 2007; 17204026). Multiple studies have shown that MSS CRCs have a worse prognosis than MSI_high tumors (Samowitz et al., 2001; 11535541, Elsaleh and Iacopetta, 2001; 12445368, Brueckl et al., 2003; 12820457, Guidoboni et al., 2001; 11438476, Gryfe et al., 2000; 10631274, Sinicrope et al., 2006; 16952542, Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Laghi and Malesci, 2012; 22722556). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60). For patients with chemotherapy_refractory microsatellite_stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), a Phase 3 trial reported no OS advantage from the combination of the PD_L1 inhibitor atezolizumab plus cobimetinib relative to regorafenib (8.9 vs. 8.5 months, HR=1.00); atezolizumab monotherapy similarly did not prolong OS (7.1 vs. 8.5 months, HR=1.19) (Ciardiello et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract LBA_004). For patients with MSS CRC, a Phase 2 study combining ipilimumab and nivolumab reported an overall DCR of 25% (10/40) (Parikh et al., 2021; DOI: 10.1038/s43018_021_00269_7). Two Phase 1 studies for patients with MSS CRC treated with regorafenib and nivolumab reported PFSs of 7.9 months (Fukuoka et al., 2020; 32343640) and 5.7 months (Kim et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1016/j.annonc.2020.04.073), and a patient with MSS CRC refractory to chemotherapy treated with the PD_1 inhibitor sintilimab and regorafenib reported a CR (Zhang et al., 2021; 34688262). MSI has not been found to be a predictive biomarker for combination chemotherapy regimens, including FOLFOX (Sinicrope et al., 2013; 24019539, Gavin et al., 2012; 23045248) and FOLFIRI (Bertagnolli et al., 2009; 19273709, Van Cutsem et al., 2009; 19451425). Patients with MSS CRC are more likely to benefit from postsurgical fluorouracil (FU)_based adjuvant therapy (Ribic et al., 2003; 12867608, Sargent et al., 2010; 20498393) but less likely to benefit from irinotecan chemotherapy (Fallik et al., 2003; 14522894).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "NRAS", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "wildtype", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "wildtype"}}, "Interpretation": "NRAS encodes a member of the RAS family of small GTPases that mediate transduction of growth signals.

No alterations in NRAS were identified in this case. The majority of colorectal cancers (CRCs) (91_98%) have been reported to lack NRAS mutations (Pentheroudakis et al., 2013; 23374602, Vaughn et al., 2011; 21305640, Janku et al., 2013; 23400451, De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739, Irahara et al., 2010; 20736745, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Schirripa et al., 2015; 24806288, Guo et al., 2018; 29666387).

Activating mutations in either KRAS (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Bokemeyer et al., 2011; 21228335, Karapetis et al., 2008; 18946061, De Roock et al., 2008; 17998284) or NRAS (Di Bartolomeo et al., 2013; 23821376, De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739), which function downstream of EGFR, are associated with lack of benefit of cetuximab for patients with CRC and indicate against the use of cetuximab (NCCN Guidelines v3.2021). Activating mutations in either KRAS (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Bokemeyer et al., 2011; 21228335, Karapetis et al., 2008; 18946061, De Roock et al., 2008; 17998284) or NRAS (Di Bartolomeo et al., 2013; 23821376, De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739), which function downstream of EGFR, are associated with lack of benefit of cetuximab for patients with CRC and indicate against the use of cetuximab (NCCN Colon Cancer Guidelines v3.2021). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> Cetuximab has been shown to improve OS, PFS, and response rate for patients with KRAS_wild_type CRC, both as first_line combination therapy with FOLFIRI or FOLFOX4 (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Bokemeyer et al., 2011; 21228335, Jonker et al., 2007; 18003960) and as monotherapy or combination therapy with irinotecan for chemotherapy_refractory patients (Cunningham et al., 2004; 15269313, De Roock et al., 2008; 17998284, Karapetis et al., 2008; 18946061). A prospective study of first_line cetuximab for patients with KRAS/NRAS/BRAF mutation_negative metastatic CRC resulted in limited efficacy, with 10.5% (2/19) of participants experiencing PRs and 57.9% (11/19) experiencing SDs (Moiseyenko et al., 2018; 29470838). The Phase 2 AVETUX trial of cetuximab combined with avelumab and mFOLFOX6 for patients with RAS_ and BRAF_wild_type metastatic CRC resulted in an ORR of 79.5% (6 CR and 25 PRs, n=39) and a DCR of 92.3% (Stein et al., 2020; ASCO GI Abstract 96). In the Phase 3 ASPECCT study, panitumumab was found to be non_inferior to cetuximab with respect to median OS (10.4 vs. 10.0 months, HR=0.97) for patients with previously treated KRAS exon 2 wildtype metastatic colorectal cancer; median PFS was also similar between the two treatment groups (4.4 vs. 4.1 months, HR=1.00)(Price et al., 2014; 24739896). In a similar patient population, a Phase 2 study of combination panitumumab and irinotecan versus combination cetuximab and irinotecan also demonstrated non_inferiority with respect to median PFS (5.4 vs. 4.3 months, HR = 0.64) and median OS (14.9 vs. 11.5 months, HR=0.66)(Sakai et al., 2020; 32526634). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Resistant", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "SMAD2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "loss", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "loss"}}, "Interpretation": "SMAD2 encodes an intracellular transducer that is activated by TGF_beta or activin to dimerize with SMAD4 and regulate transcription of TGF_beta or activin_activated genes (Lebrun et al., 1999; 9892009, Lin et al., 2006; 16751101). SMAD2 alterations that disrupt the MH1 domain (amino acids 10_176), MH2 domain (amino acids 274_467), or critical phosphorylation sites are predicted to result in a loss of function (Fleming et al., 2013; 23139211, Funaba et al., 2002; 12193595, Mac\u00edas_Silva et al., 1996; 8980228, Massague et al., 2005; 16322555, Matsuzaki et al., 2009; 19531654, Wu et al., 2012; 22539990). SMAD2 mutations have been reported in various tumor types, including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC; 6_10%)(Li et al., 2015; 25589618), colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC; 3_7%)(Fleming et al., 2013; 23139211, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696), endometrial cancers (2_5%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2013; 23636398), stomach adenocarcinoma (2_3%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317), lung SCC (1_2%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745), and lung adenocarcinoma (1_2%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, cBio_Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Uchida et al., 1996; 8971158, cBio_Ding et al., 2008; 18948947). SMAD2 deletion, as well as loss of expression or phosphorylation (p_SMAD2), has been reported in several cancers (Boulay et al., 2001; 11391794, Xie et al., 2003; 12967141, Koumoundourou et al., 2007; 17695423, Xie et al., 2002; 11809701, Liapis et al., 2007; 17295676, Wu et al., 2007; 17729405, Mac\u00edas_Silva et al., 1996; 8980228) and has been correlated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular, gastric, breast, and colorectal cancer (Xie et al., 2003; 12967141, Koumoundourou et al., 2007; 17695423, Xie et al., 2002; 11809701, Liapis et al., 2007; 17295676, Wu et al., 2007; 17729405) but good prognosis in HNSCC (Xie et al., 2013; 22275186, Mangone et al., 2010; 20462450). There are no therapies that target the loss of SMAD2 or loss of TGF_beta signaling in cancer. Because TGF_beta can exert both tumor suppressor as well as pro_tumor effects, the development of therapies aimed at this pathway must be carefully considered for each patient. In preclinical studies, several novel small_molecule TGF_beta pathway inhibitors have been shown to reduce SMAD2 phosphorylation and tumor invasion in breast cancer cells and to increase survival in mouse xenograft models (Ehata et al., 2007; 17129361, Rausch et al., 2009; 19528470).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "R175H", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "R175H"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 mutations have been reported in up to 60% of colorectal cancer cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Goh et al., 1995; 7585578, Berg et al., 2010; 21103049, Han et al., 2013; 23700467, Peeters et al., 2013; 23325582, Malhotra et al., 2013; 23526092, Di Bartolomeo et al., 2013; 23821376). A study reported p53 expression in 49% of analyzed colorectal cancer cases (Wangefjord et al., 2013; 23337059). TP53 mutation has not been consistently demonstrated to be a significant independent prognostic marker in the context of CRC (Russo et al., 2005; 16172461). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may also be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as APR_246 (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571, Lehmann et al., 2012; 22965953, Mohell et al., 2015; 26086967, Franssonet al., 2016; 27179933). In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, APR_246 combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "04", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "04"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Fabrizio et al., 2018; 30151257, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526). Elevated tumor mutational burden (TMB) has been reported in 8_25% of colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (George et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3587, Nagahashi et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e15103, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117, Shao et al., 2020; 33119110). Multiple studies have reported that up to 90% of hypermutated CRC cases exhibit high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI_H) and mismatch repair deficiency (MMR_D) (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). Increased TMB is significantly associated with MSI_H and MMR_D, with studies reporting that 100% of MSI_H CRCs harbor elevated TMB and conversely that 100% of tumors with low TMB harbor intact MMR (George et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3587, Nagahashi et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e15103, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). A subset of CRCs that harbor increased TMB but not MSI_H are driven by mutations in POLE, which leads to an \u201cultramutated\u201d phenotype with especially high TMB (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). Tumors with increased TMB harbor BRAF V600E mutations more frequently than those with low TMB (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117), whereas TMB_low tumors more frequently harbor mutations in TP53 and APC (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696). In a study for 61 patients with metastatic, microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC treated with best standard of care, plasma TMB scores \u226528 muts/Mb (approximately 14 muts/Mb as measured by this assay) were associated with reduced OS as compared with plasma TMB scores <28 muts/Mb (3.0 vs. 5.3 months, HR 0.76, p=0.007), whereas tissue TMB was not found to be prognostic in this population (Chen et al., 2020; 32379280, Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, higher TMB has been reported to be associated with increased ORR and OS from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). Higher TMB was found to be significantly associated with improved OS upon immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment for patients with 9 types of advanced tumors (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254). Analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy, compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386). However, the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors found significant improvement in ORR for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (based on this assay or others) compared to those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb, in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types; similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). Together, these studies suggest that patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb may derive clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1 inhibitors. In CRC specifically, a retrospective analysis of immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy reported significantly improved OS for patients with tumors harboring TMB \u22659.8 Muts/MB compared with those with tumors with TMB <9.8 Muts/Mb (~ equivalency <12 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254). Another retrospective study reported that a TMB \u226512 Muts/Mb cutoff identifies >99% of MSI_High CRC cases but only 3% of MSS cases, indicating the utility of this cutoff for identification of patients with CRC likely to benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Fabrizio et al., 2018; 30151257).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "APC", "Alteration": "R283*E1451fs*25", "Title": "A Study of E7386 in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Previously Treated Participants With Selected Solid Tumors", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1/2", "Target": "CBP, Beta_catenin, PD_1", "Locations": "Tokyo (Japan)", "NCTID": "NCT05091346", "Note": "Based on preclinical and limited clinical data, APC inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to CBP/beta_catenin interaction inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "APC", "Alteration": "R283*E1451fs*25", "Title": "A Study of E7386 in Combination With Other Anticancer Drug in Participants With Solid Tumor", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "CBP, Beta_catenin, FGFRs, RET, PDGFRA, VEGFRs, KIT", "Locations": "Osakasayama (Japan), Chuo_Ku (Japan), Kashiwa (Japan)", "NCTID": "NCT04008797", "Note": "Based on preclinical and limited clinical data, APC inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to CBP/beta_catenin interaction inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "APC", "Alteration": "R283*E1451fs*25", "Title": "A Study of E7386 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumor Including Colorectal Cancer (CRC)", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "CBP, Beta_catenin", "Locations": "Chuo Ku (Japan), Kashiwa (Japan)", "NCTID": "NCT03833700", "Note": "Based on preclinical and limited clinical data, APC inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to CBP/beta_catenin interaction inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "APC", "Alteration": "R283*E1451fs*25", "Title": "Study of E7386 in Participants With Selected Advanced Neoplasms", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "CBP, Beta_catenin", "Locations": "Glasgow (United Kingdom), Manchester (United Kingdom), Sutton (United Kingdom)", "NCTID": "NCT03264664", "Note": "Based on preclinical and limited clinical data, APC inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to CBP/beta_catenin interaction inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "FBXW7", "Alteration": "R465C", "Title": "Trametinib Combined With Everolimus and Lenvatinib for Recurrent/Refractory Advanced Solid Tumors", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "mTOR, FGFRs, RET, PDGFRA, VEGFRs, KIT, MEK", "Locations": "Guangzhou (China)", "NCTID": "NCT04803318", "Note": "Loss or inactivation of FBXW7 may lead to increased mTOR activation and may predict sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors.
