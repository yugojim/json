In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). Amplification of EGFR has been associated with increased expression of EGFR mRNA and protein in several cancer types (Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Bhargava et al., 2005; 15920544, Yang et al., 2012; 22490401). EGFR amplification has been observed in MPNST (Holtkamp et al., 2008; 18650488, Du et al., 2013; 24341609, Albritton et al., 2006; ASCO Abstract 9518), but was not detected in 20 schwannomas (Prayson et al., 2007; 17870017) or in 8 plexiform neurofibromas (Holtkamp et al., 2008; 18650488). EGFR protein expression has been reported in 28_63% of MPNST (Holtkamp et al., 2008; 18650488, Keizman et al., 2009; 19330289, Tawbi et al., 2008; 18448562), whereas EGFR expression was not detected in schwannomas (0/20)(Prayson et al., 2007; 17870017). In a study of 46 MPNST patients, overexpression of EGFR was found to correlate with lower 5_year DFS (17.4 months), time to progression (mean 5.2 months), and 5_year survival (25%) as compared to patients without overexpression (DFS 30.1 months; time to progression, mean 9.2 months; 5_year survival, 52%)(Keizman et al., 2009; 19330289). Similar findings were reported in another study of 51 MPNST patients, with high expression of EGFR correlating with poor DFS and OS (Du et al., 2013; 24341609). Based on clinical studies across multiple tumor types, EGFR amplification or expression may predict sensitivity to the second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib (Kim et al., 2017; 28418920, Kwak et al., 2013; 23775486, Janjigian et al., 2014; AACR Abstract CT228, Sanchez_Vega et al., 2019; 30463996, Hong et al., 2020; 32749686, Chen et al., 2020; 32184619, Lai et al., 2019; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00186, Cohen et al., 2016; ASTRO Abstract 10, Machiels et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 1079P, Machiels et al., 2018; 29346507) and dacomitinib (Necchi et al., 2018; 28921872, Kim et al., 2015; 25424851). There are conflicting data on the efficacy of anti_EGFR antibodies for the treatment of EGFR_amplified tumors.

MYC dysregulation (amplification, overexpression, translocation) has been identified in a number of different cancer types (Nesbit et al., 1999; 10378696). MYC amplification has been significantly linked with increased mRNA and protein levels and results in the dysregulation of a large number of target genes (Blancato et al., 2004; 15083194, Dang et al., 2006; 16904903, Fromont et al., 2013; 23574779).

Exploratory biomarker analysis in a Phase 2 study reported a PFS benefit associated with a combination of the Aurora A kinase inhibitor alisertib and paclitaxel as second_line therapy for patients with MYC_overexpressed small cell lung cancer but not for patients without MYC overexpression (Owonikoko et al., 2020; 31655296). A PR was reported for a patient with MYC_amplified invasive ductal breast carcinoma treated with an unspecified Aurora kinase inhibitor and taxol (Ganesan et al., 2014; 25253784). MYC amplification has also been suggested to predict response to chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer in some studies (Pereira et al., 2013; 23555992, Yasojima et al., 2011; 21741827).

Neurofibromin acts as a tumor suppressor by repressing RAS signaling (Morcos et al., 1996; 8628317). The consequences of alterations that may leave the GAP_related domain intact, such as seen here, are unclear; however, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. NF1 loss, either through deletion or inactivation, has been reported frequently in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), which may be associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 and have been shown to occur in approximately 10% of patients with this disorder (Upadhyaya et al., 2008; 17960768). One study reported NF1 deletion in 82% (28/34) of MPNST samples and NF1 mutation in another three tumors, for NF1 loss in 91% (31/34) of MPNST samples analyzed (Upadhyaya et al., 2008; 17960768). Somatic mutations in the NF1 gene have been identified in both neurofibromatosis_associated and sporadic MPNSTs, and are found in approximately 40% of patients (Bottillo et al., 2009; 19142971). Neurofibromas are a characteristic clinical feature exhibited by neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients. Germline NF1 mutations have been reported in 83_95% of NF1 patients, and somatic NF1 mutations were also found to be common in neurofibromas, with 77 somatic mutations found in 109 cutaneous neurofibromas from 46 NF1 patients (Laycock_van et al., 2011; 22155606, Thomas et al., 2012; 22108604, Messiaen et al., 2000; 10862084). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at NF1 has been found in approximately 20_40% of cutaneous neurofibromas, and in plexiform neurofibromas, a more diffuse type of tumor of which about 10_15% of cases may transform to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), NF1 LOH is found in approximately 70% of cases (Laycock_van et al., 2011; 22155606, Thomas et al., 2012; 22108604, Upadhyaya et al., 2008; 18484666). NF1 status has been reported to be correlated with the tumor_free and overall survival of MPNST patients (Fan et al., 2013; 23749326). On the basis of clinical evidence in neurofibromatosis Type 1_associated neurofibroma (Dombi et al., 2016; 28029918, Schalkwijk et al., 2021; 33903938, Glassberg et al., 2020; ASPHO Abstract 2015, Coyne et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 3612, McCowage et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 10504, Mueller et al., 2020; SNO Abstract NFB_17, Toledano et al., 2021; 33751171, Waldner et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1055/s_0040_1715638, Ronsley et al., 2021; 33939292), glioma or glioblastoma (Fangusaro et al., 2019; 31151904, Manoharan et al., 2020; 32780261, Kondyli et al., 2018; 30097824, Ronsley et al., 2021; 33939292, Romo et al., 2019; SNO Abstract RARE_54, Awada et al., 2020; 33082744), and non_small cell lung cancer (Middleton et al., 2020; 32669708), NF1 inactivation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors such as cobimetinib, trametinib, binimetinib, and selumetinib. Loss or inactivation of NF1 may also predict sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors, including everolimus and temsirolimus, based on limited clinical data (Lim et al., 2016; 26859683, Weiss et al., 2015; 25314964, Janku et al., 2014; 24931142) and strong preclinical data in models of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST)(Johannessen et al., 2008; 18164202, Johannessen et al., 2005; 15937108). A preclinical study suggests that combined mTOR and MEK inhibition is effective in a model of NF1_deficient MPNST (Malone et al., 2014; 24913553). Whereas frequent adverse events precluded a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for the combination of trametinib and everolimus in a Phase 1b trial for solid tumors (Tolcher et al., 2014; 25344362), a retrospective study for heavily pretreated patients with solid tumors reported tolerable regimens of the combination for 23/31 patients, with 16 patients treated >3 months and evaluable patients achieving a median PFS of 6.5 months (Patterson et al., 2018; AACR Abstract 3891). It is not known whether these therapeutic approaches would be relevant in the context of alterations that have not been fully characterized, as seen here. NF1, CDKN2A/B, and PRC2 components such as EED and SUZ12 are recurrently co_mutated in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (NCCN Soft Tissue Sarcoma Guidelines, v2.2022)(Pernov et al., 2019; 32642732, Lee et al., 2014; 25240281, Kallen et al., 2020; 32796172, Upadhyaya et al., 2008; 17960768, Bottillo et al., 2009; 19142971). One or more of the NF1 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (ClinVar, Mar 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in NF1 cause the autosomal dominant disorder neurofibromatosis type 1, which is characterized in part by increased risk of developing various tumors, including sarcoma, glioma, breast carcinoma, and neuroendocrine and hematological neoplasms (Jett and Friedman, 2010; 20027112, Patil and Chamberlain, 2012; 22240541, Evans et al., 2012; 23036231). Estimates for the prevalence of the disorder in the general population range from 1:2,500 to 1:3,000 (Upadhyaya et al., 1995; 8544190, Williams et al., 2009; 19117870), and in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of NF1 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "On the basis of clinical evidence and strong preclinical evidence, NF1 inactivation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors.

A Phase 2 clinical trial of selumetinib for children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) reported an ORR of 68% (51/75), all of which were PRs (Schalkwijk et al., 2021; 33903938, Glassberg et al., 2020; ASPHO Abstract 2015). A Phase 2 study of selumetinib for adults with PNs resulted in 50% (13/26) PRs (Coyne et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 3612). A Phase 1 clinical trial for selumetinib for children with NF1 and inoperable PN reported 71% (17/24) PRs (Dombi et al., 2016; 28029918). A Phase 2 study of selumetinib for patients with tumors with activating alterations in the MAPK pathway observed SD for 13 cycles as best response for the single patient with PN (Eckstein et al., 2022; 35363510). In 1 case study, selumetinib resulted in a significant tumor volume reduction in a pediatric patient with PN and an ongoing clinical response of 23 months (Passos et al., 2019; 31917098). Selumetinib has demonstrated efficacy in NF1_associated neurofibroma in Phase 2 studies (Schalkwijk et al., 2021; 33903938, Glassberg et al., 2020; ASPHO Abstract 2015, Coyne et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 3612) and a Phase 1 study (Dombi et al., 2016; 28029918). Phase 2 studies reported clinical responses in low_grade glioma (Fangusaro et al., 2019; 31151904, Banerjee et al., 2017; 28339824), melanoma (Gupta et al., 2014; 24567366, Robert et al., 2013; 23735514, Kirkwood et al., 2012; 22048237, Banerji et al., 2010; 20179232, Boers_Sonderen et al., 2012; 22293660), and in lung (Lopez_Chavez et al., 2015; 25667274, Hainsworth et al., 2010; 20802351, Middleton et al., 2020; 32669708) and endometrial cancer (Coleman et al., 2015; 25887099). A Phase 2 study of selumetinib for patients with activating alterations in the MAPK pathway reported a DCR of 15% (3/20), with no objective responses observed (Eckstein et al., 2022; 35363510). Phase 1 studies of selumetinib to treat patients with solid tumors reported 1/15 PR for a patient with colorectal cancer (CRC) and 5/15 SDs for patients with tonsil squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and CRC (Deming et al., 2016; 26666244); 2/39 PRs (for patients with CRC) and 18/39 SDs were achieved when selumetinib was administered in combination with cyclosporin A (Krishnamurthy et al., 2018; 30042150).

Both p15INK4b and p16INK4a bind to and inhibit CDK4 and CDK6, thereby maintaining the growth_suppressive activity of the Rb tumor suppressor; loss or inactivation of either p15INK4b or p16INK4a contributes to dysregulation of the CDK4/6_cyclin_Rb pathway and loss of cell cycle control (Gazzeri et al., 1998; 9484839, Roussel, 1999; 10498883). The tumor suppressive functions of p14ARF involve stabilization and activation of p53, via a mechanism of MDM2 inhibition (Sherr et al., 2005; 16869746, Ozenne et al., 2010; 20549699). One or more alterations observed here are predicted to result in p16INK4a loss of function (Ruas et al., 1999; 10498896, Jones et al., 2007; 17909018, Haferkamp et al., 2008; 18843795, Huot et al., 2002; 12417717, Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Gombart et al., 1997; 9324288, Yang et al., 1995; 7780957, Parry and Peters, 1996; 8668202, Greenblatt et al., 2003; 12606942, Yarbrough et al., 1999; 10491434, Poi et al., 2001; 11255261, Byeon et al., 1998; 9660926, Kannengiesser et al., 2009; 19260062, Lal et al., 2000; 10719365, Koh et al., 1995; 7777061, McKenzie et al., 2010; 20340136, Miller et al., 2011; 21462282, Arap et al., 1997; 905385, Scaini et al., 2014; 24659262, Jenkins et al., 2013; 23190892, Walker et al., 1999; 10389768, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). One or more alterations seen here are predicted to result in p14ARF loss of function (Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Itahana and Zhang, 2008; 18538737, Zhang and Xiong, 1999; 10360174, Zhang et al., 1998; 9529249, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). CDKN2B alterations such as seen here are predicted to inactivate p15INK4b (Jafri et al., 2015; 25873077). In the malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) MSKCC dataset, homozygous deletion of both CDKN2A and CDKN2B was reported in 67% (10/15) of cases (cBio_Lee et al., 2014; 25240281). Deletion of the CDKN2A/B locus has been reported in approximately 33% of MPNST tumors (Mantripragada et al., 2009; 19603524, Endo et al., 2011; 21262917). Loss of CDKN2A and CDKN2B expression has been reported at a higher level, from 50_80% (Endo et al., 2011; 21262917, Perrone et al., 2003; 14519636, Agesen et al., 2005; 15715087). Genomic loss of CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been associated with poor prognosis in patients with MPNST (Endo et al., 2011; 21262917). Clinical data in mesothelioma, breast cancer, and uterine leiomyosarcoma indicate that CDKN2A loss may predict sensitivity to abemaciclib (Fennell et al., 2022; 35157829) and palbociclib treatment (Elvin et al., 2017; 28283584, Gao et al., 2015; 26715889). However, multiple other clinical studies have shown no significant correlation between p16INK4a loss or inactivation and therapeutic benefit of these agents (Gopalan et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8077, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Konecny et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5557)(DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Johnson et al., 2014; 24797823); it is not known whether CDK4/6 inhibitors would be beneficial in this case. Although preclinical studies have suggested that loss of p14ARF function may be associated with reduced sensitivity to MDM2 inhibitors (Van Maerken et al., 2011; 21460101, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357), the clinical relevance of p14ARF as a predictive biomarker is not clear. Preclinical data suggest that tumors with loss of p16INK4a function may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, ribociclib, and palbociclib (Konecny et al., 2011; 21278246, Katsumi et al., 2011; 21871868, Cen et al., 2012; 22711607, Logan et al., 2013; 23898052). There are no drugs that directly target the mutation or loss of CDKN2B in cancer. Because the p15INK4b protein encoded by CDKN2B is known to inhibit CDK4, tumors with CDKN2B mutation or loss may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as ribociclib, abemaciclib, and palbociclib (Infante et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 2528, Shapiro et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 2500)(Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126). NF1, CDKN2A/B, and PRC2 components such as EED and SUZ12 are recurrently co_mutated in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (NCCN Soft Tissue Sarcoma Guidelines, v2.2022)(Pernov et al., 2019; 32642732, Lee et al., 2014; 25240281, Kallen et al., 2020; 32796172, Upadhyaya et al., 2008; 17960768, Bottillo et al., 2009; 19142971). Germline CDKN2A mutation is associated with melanoma_pancreatic cancer syndrome, a condition marked by increased risk of developing malignant melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer (Whelan et al., 1995; 7666917). Mutation carriers within families may develop either or both types of cancer, and melanoma cases may be referred to as familial or hereditary melanoma (Hansson, 2010; 20687502, Hogg et al., 1998; 9479083). CDKN2A is the most implicated gene in familial melanoma, with germline mutations present in 16% to 20% of familial melanoma cases (De Unamuno et al., 2018; 29543703, Soura et al., 2016; 26892650, Huerta et al., 2018; 29405243). CDKN2A alteration has also been implicated in familial melanoma_astrocytoma syndrome, an extremely rare tumor association characterized by dual predisposition to melanoma and nervous system tumors (Kaufman et al., 1993; 8414022, Bahuau et al., 1998; 9622062, Chan et al., 2017; 28699883).

Deletion of the CDKN2A/B locus has been reported in approximately 33% of MPNST tumors (Mantripragada et al., 2009; 19603524, Endo et al., 2011; 21262917). Loss of CDKN2A and CDKN2B expression has been reported at a higher level, from 50_80% (Endo et al., 2011; 21262917, Perrone et al., 2003; 14519636, Agesen et al., 2005; 15715087). Genomic loss of CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been associated with poor prognosis in patients with MPNST (Endo et al., 2011; 21262917). Clinical data in mesothelioma, breast cancer, and uterine leiomyosarcoma indicate that CDKN2A loss may predict sensitivity to abemaciclib (Fennell et al., 2022; 35157829) and palbociclib treatment (Elvin et al., 2017; 28283584, Gao et al., 2015; 26715889). However, multiple other clinical studies have shown no significant correlation between p16INK4a loss or inactivation and therapeutic benefit of these agents (Gopalan et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8077, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Konecny et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5557)(DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Johnson et al., 2014; 24797823); it is not known whether CDK4/6 inhibitors would be beneficial in this case. Although preclinical studies have suggested that loss of p14ARF function may be associated with reduced sensitivity to MDM2 inhibitors (Van Maerken et al., 2011; 21460101, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357), the clinical relevance of p14ARF as a predictive biomarker is not clear. Preclinical data suggest that tumors with loss of p16INK4a function may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, ribociclib, and palbociclib (Konecny et al., 2011; 21278246, Katsumi et al., 2011; 21871868, Cen et al., 2012; 22711607, Logan et al., 2013; 23898052). There are no drugs that directly target the mutation or loss of CDKN2B in cancer. Because the p15INK4b protein encoded by CDKN2B is known to inhibit CDK4, tumors with CDKN2B mutation or loss may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as ribociclib, abemaciclib, and palbociclib (Infante et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 2528, Shapiro et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 2500)(Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126). NF1, CDKN2A/B, and PRC2 components such as EED and SUZ12 are recurrently co_mutated in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (NCCN Soft Tissue Sarcoma Guidelines, v2.2022)(Pernov et al., 2019; 32642732, Lee et al., 2014; 25240281, Kallen et al., 2020; 32796172, Upadhyaya et al., 2008; 17960768, Bottillo et al., 2009; 19142971). Germline CDKN2A mutation is associated with melanoma_pancreatic cancer syndrome, a condition marked by increased risk of developing malignant melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer (Whelan et al., 1995; 7666917). Mutation carriers within families may develop either or both types of cancer, and melanoma cases may be referred to as familial or hereditary melanoma (Hansson, 2010; 20687502, Hogg et al., 1998; 9479083). CDKN2A is the most implicated gene in familial melanoma, with germline mutations present in 16% to 20% of familial melanoma cases (De Unamuno et al., 2018; 29543703, Soura et al., 2016; 26892650, Huerta et al., 2018; 29405243). CDKN2A alteration has also been implicated in familial melanoma_astrocytoma syndrome, an extremely rare tumor association characterized by dual predisposition to melanoma and nervous system tumors (Kaufman et al., 1993; 8414022, Bahuau et al., 1998; 9622062, Chan et al., 2017; 28699883). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of CDKN2A is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI has been studied in small cohorts of MPNST. One study reported a 30% (3/10) MSI_low frequency; another reported MSI in 45% (5/11) of samples (Kobayashi et al., 2006; 16527603, Upadhyaya et al., 2004; 14722917). MSI_high (MSI_H) has been observed at high frequency in endometrial cancers (14_33%)(Santin et al., ASCO 2016; Abstract 414, Zighelboim et al., 2007; 17513808, Hampel et al., 2006; 16885385, Stelloo et al., 2016; 27006490, Kanopiene et al., 2014; 25458958, Black et al., 2006; 16549821, Nout et al., 2012; 22609107, Steinbakk et al., 2011; 21547578, Bilbao et al., 2010; 20005452), colorectal cancers (CRCs; 10_15%)(Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), and gastric cancers (12_35%)(Hiyama et al., 2004; 15209621, Wu et al., 1998; 9537253, dos Santos et al., 1996; 8536886, Fang et al., 2013; 23555086) and at lower frequencies in many other tumor types, including esophageal (Hall et al., 2016; ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancer Symposium Abstract 528, Farris et al., 2011; 21422910), small bowel (Gingras et al., 2015; AACR Pancreatic Cancer Abstract PR06, Agaramet al., 2010; 20395525, Ruemmele et al., 2009; 19252434, Planck et al., 2003; 12627520, Hibi et al., 1995; 7775257, Muneyuki et al., 2000; 11117578), hepatobiliary (Zhang et al., 2005; 15918185, Chiappini et al., 2004; 14656944, Suto et al., 2001; 11223838, Momoi et al., 2001; 11580146, Liengswangwong et al., 2003; 14506736, Moy et al., 2015; 25680569, Yoshida et al., 2000; 11063221), prostate (Cheng et al., 2016; Genitourinary Cancers Symposium Abstract 251, Pritchard et al., 2014; 25255306, Azzouzi et al., 2007; 17233803, Burger et al., 2006; 16924473), and urinary tract carcinomas (Harper et al., 2015; USCAP Abstract 905, Bai et al., 2013; 23690119, Giedl et al., 2014; 25319978, Yamamoto et al., 2006; 16675567). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of MSI in nerve sheath tumors are limited (PubMed, Feb 2022). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "RB1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "rearrangement exon 11", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "rearrangement exon 11"}}, "Interpretation": "RB1 encodes the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), a tumor suppressor and negative regulator of the cell cycle (Burkhart and Sage, 2008; 18650841, Knudsen and Knudsen, 2008; 19143056). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt RB1 function or expression (Berge et al., 2010; 20594292, Giacinti et al., 2006; 16936740, Otterson et al., 1997; 9342358, Otterson et al., 1999; 10486322, Qin et al., 1992; 1534305, Rubin et al., 2005; 16360038, Sun et al., 2006; 16449662). In one study, RB1 mutation was observed in 7% (1/15) malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), and RB1 homozygous deletion was not observed (cBio_Lee et al., 2014; 25240281). RB1 alterations have been reported in neurofibromatosis type_1 (NF1)_associated MPNSTs (Upadhyaya, 2011; 21196210). One study has reported loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for RB1 in 40% (4/10) of MPNSTs analyzed (Thomas et al., 2012; 23244685). The prognostic significance of RB1 alterations in the context of MPNST has not been extensively investigated (PubMed, Sep 2021). On the basis of limited clinical data (Owonikoko et al., 2016; ESMO Abstract 14230) and strong preclinical data (Hook et al., 2012; 22222631, Gong et al., 2019; 30373917, Oser et al., 2019; 30373918, Yang et al., 2022; 34741392), RB1 inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to inhibitors of Aurora kinase A, particularly in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). A clinical study evaluating the Aurora kinase A inhibitor alisertib for patients with prostate cancer did not find an association between RB1 deletion and clinical benefit (Beltran et al., 2019; 30232224). Other approaches to target RB1 inactivation under investigation in preclinical studies include inhibitors of BCL_2 family members (Allaman_Pillet et al., 2013; 21955141) and activation of the NOTCH pathway (Viatour et al., 2011; 21875955). Mutations in RB1 underlie the development of retinoblastoma (RB), a rare tumor that arises at a rate of approximately 1:20,000 live births, with nearly 5,000 new cases worldwide per year (Chen et al., 2014; 24282159). Germline mutations in RB1 account for approximately 40% of RB tumors (Yun et al., 2011; 22553621) and are associated with an increased risk of developing secondary malignancies that include soft tissue and bone sarcoma and malignant melanoma (Houston et al., 2011; 21139478, Ng et al., 2010; 19959033). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of RB1 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "A138fs*32", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "A138fs*32"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 mutations have been reported in 9.6% of soft tissue malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), but have not been reported in any of the 66 soft tissue neurofibroma or 11 soft tissue schwannoma samples analyzed in COSMIC (Mar 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). In the literature, TP53 mutations have been reported in up to 40% of MPNSTs (Brohl et al., 2017; 29118384, cBio_Lee et al., 2014; 25240281, Verdijk et al., 2010; 20010306, Evans et al., 2012; 23036231, Upadhyaya et al., 2008; 17960768). Heterozygous deletions or homozygous loss of TP53 have been reported in 17_50% of cases (Yu et al., 2011; 21325289, Holtkamp et al., 2008; 18650488, Mantripragada et al., 2008; 18650488). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of TP53 has also been observed in MPNST; one study noted TP53 mutation in 11/19 MPNST (Upadhyaya et al., 2008; 17960768) and another reported a high level of intra_tumoral heterogeneity for TP53 LOH (Thomas et al., 2012; 23244685). Loss of the chromosomal region encoding TP53 (17p13) has been observed in 9 cases of NF1_positive neurofibroma (Koga et al., 2002; 12081210). Reports of p53 protein overexpression in MPNST have varied, but p53 protein overexpression has been correlated with TP53 mutation (Mawrin et al., 2002; 12070601, Verdijk et al., 2010; 20010306, Holtkamp et al., 2007; 17786186). The prognostic impact of TP53 aberrations in MPNST is unclear, with some studies associating TP53 alterations with higher tumor grade (Upadhyaya et al., 2008; 17960768, Holtkamp et al., 2007; 17786186), but other studies observing that TP53 alterations were not prognostic in MPNST or schwannoma (Yu et al., 2011; 21325289, Mantripragada et al., 2008; 18650488, Pekmezci et al., 2015; 25189642). High TP53 expression correlated with inferior PFS on the univariate, but not multivariate analysis in one study (Fan et al., 2014; 23749326), but no significant impact of TP53 expression on OS was observed (Yu et al., 2011; 21325289, Fan et al., 2014; 23749326). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "03", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "03"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen.

This sample harbors a TMB level associated with lower rates of clinical benefit from treatment with PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors compared with patients with tumors harboring higher TMB levels, based on several studies in multiple solid tumor types (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) harbors a median TMB of 2.5 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 8.2% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). The prognostic significance of TMB in nerve sheath tumors has not been extensively studied (PubMed, Oct 2021). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, increased tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Ott et al., 2019; 30557521, Cristescu et al., 2022; 35101941, Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). In the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors, significant improvement in ORR was observed for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) compared with those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526); similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). At the same TMB cutpoint, retrospective analysis of patients with solid tumors treated with any checkpoint inhibitor identified that tissue TMB scores \u2265 10 Muts/Mb were associated with prolonged time to treatment failure compared with scores <10 muts/Mb (HR=0.68) (Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). For patients with solid tumors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the CheckMate 848 trial, improved responses were observed in patients with a tissue TMB \u2265 10 Muts/Mb independent of blood TMB at any cutpoint in matched samples (Schenker at al., 2022; AACR Abstract 7845). However, support for higher TMB thresholds and efficacy was observed in the prospective Phase 2 MyPathway trial of atezolizumab for patients with pan_solid tumors, where improved ORR and DCR was seen in patients with TMB \u2265 16 Muts/Mb than those with TMB \u2265 10 and <16 Muts/Mb (Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409). Similarly, analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "EGFR", "Alteration": "amplification", "Title": "A Study of CC_95251, a Monoclonal Antibody Directed Against SIRP\u03b1, in Subjects With Advanced Solid and Hematologic Cancers", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "CD20, EGFR, SIRP_alpha", "Locations": "Seoul (Korea, Republic of), Heidelberg (Australia), Melbourne (Australia), Edmonton (Canada), Rouen (France), Oregon, Creteil (France), Nantes Cedex 01 (France), Borddeaux Cedex (France), Villejuif CEDEX (France)", "NCTID": "NCT03783403", "Note": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.
