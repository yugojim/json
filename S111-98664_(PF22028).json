In colorectal cancer, 20q gain has been associated with BCL_XL protein overexpression (Annunziata et al., 2007; 18006758, Kar et al., 2007; 17611399, Sillars_Hardebol et al., 2012; 22009326). Gain of the 20q region where BCL2L1 is located has been reported in 34% of lung adenocarcinoma samples and in 75% of lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR mutations (Shen et al., 2009; 18848758, Reinmuth et al., 2008; 18450321). Expression of BCL_XL protein has been associated with poor prognosis in patients with ovarian cancer and has been reported to be associated with taxane resistance in colorectal cancer (Elstrand et al., 2009; 19620938, Postma et al., 2007; 17429145, Biroccio et al., 2001; 11290547, Williams et al., 2005; 15661210, Wong et al., 2012; 22302098). There are no approved therapies that target BCL2L1 amplification in cancer. Multiple investigational drugs that target BCL_2 family members including ABT_737, oblimersen sodium, AT_101, ABT_263 (navitoclax), and GX15_070 (obatoclax) are being studied in clinical trials (Kang et al., 2009; 19228717). Preclinical studies have shown activity of BCL_XL inhibitors in NSCLC cell lines and a xenograft mouse model (Zhou et al., 2012; 22747598, Zhou et al., 2012; 22448988). Elevated BCL_XL levels protect cancer cells against apoptosis in multiple cancer types and may contribute to chemotherapy resistance (Zhang et al., 2008; 18494061, Ni Chonghaile et al., 2011; 22033517, Lei et al., 2007; 17492131, Qian et al., 2009; 19139118).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "MLL2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "L3329fs*1", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "L3329fs*1"}}, "Interpretation": "MLL2 encodes an H3K4_specific histone methyltransferase that is involved in the transcriptional response to progesterone signaling (Vicent et al., 2011; 21447625). Germline de novo mutations of MLL2 are responsible for the majority of cases of Kabuki syndrome, a complex and phenotypically distinctive developmental disorder (Hannibal et al., 2011; 21671394). A significant number of inactivating MLL2 alterations have been observed in multiple tumor types, suggesting a tumor suppressor role (Fagan et al.,2019; 31128216). MLL2 alterations are observed in a number of solid tumor contexts (COSMIC, Jan 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878), and are especially prevalent in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2012; 22960745) and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) (Augert et al., 2017; 28007623). MLL2 mutation was found to be an independent prognostic factor of poor PFS and OS in non_small cell lung cancer, but not in SCLC (Ardeshir_Larijani et al., 2018; 29627316). One study reported that MLL2 truncating mutations were more common in recurrent ovary granulosa cell tumors (GCT) compared with primary GCTs (24% [10/42] vs. 3.0% [1/32])(Hillman et al., 2018; 29950560). In a study of esophageal SCC, high MLL2 expression positively correlated with tumor stage, differentiation, and size, and negatively correlated with OS (Abudureheman et al., 2018; 29532228). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in MLL2. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors may detect nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI has been reported in 3.1_14.6% of prostate cancer samples (Hall et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 1523, Cheng et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 251)(Pritchard et al., 2014; 25255306, Schwarzenbach et al., 2008; 18336598, Suzuki et al., 1995; 7493915). A study of prostate cancer in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) families reported MSI_H in 4_50% of cases (Dominguez_Valentin et al., 2016; 27013479, Rosty et al., 2014; 25117503, Ahman et al., 2001; 11251526). For patients with advanced prostate cancer, dMMR/MSI status was associated with shorter median OS compared with patients with proficient MMR (3.8 vs. 7.0 years) by univariate and multivariate analysis (adjusted HR=4.09; P=0.005)(Rodrigues et al., 2018; 30382943). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "RB1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "loss exon 1", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "loss exon 1"}}, "Interpretation": "RB1 encodes the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), a tumor suppressor and negative regulator of the cell cycle (Burkhart and Sage, 2008; 18650841, Knudsen and Knudsen, 2008; 19143056). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt RB1 function or expression (Berge et al., 2010; 20594292, Giacinti et al., 2006; 16936740, Otterson et al., 1997; 9342358, Otterson et al., 1999; 10486322, Qin et al., 1992; 1534305, Rubin et al., 2005; 16360038, Sun et al., 2006; 16449662). RB1 mutation has been reported in 0_10% of prostate carcinoma cases (cBio_Robinson et al., 2015; 26000489, cBio_Baca et al., 2013; 23622249, cBio_Barbieri et al., 2012; 22610119, cBio_Taylor et al., 2010; 20579941, cBio_Grasso et al., 2012; 22722839). RB1 deletion and loss of heterozygosity have been reported to occur frequently in the progression from primary to castration_resistant prostate cancer and have been cited in up to 65% of prostate cancer cases in the scientific literature (Friedlander et al., 2012; 22158653, Bettendorf et al., 2008; 18383208, Latil et al., 1999; 10414500, Cooney et al., 1996; 8640774, Phillips et al., 1994; 7526887). Loss of Rb protein expression has also been detected in 22_74% of prostate cancers (Cooney et al., 1996; 8640774, Sharma et al., 2010; 21099110). RB1 mutation, deletion, or loss has been correlated with increased androgen receptor (AR) signaling and poor prognosis in patients with castration_resistant prostate cancer (Sharma et al., 2010; 21099110, Chen et al., 2019; 30928160, Chen et al., 2019; 31010837, Kohli et al., 2020; 32268276, Graf et al., 2021; 34716049). Concurrent alterations in at least 2 of the TP53, RB1, and PTEN genes, as seen in this sample, molecularly define a subtype of prostate cancer with aggressive clinical course and reduced sensitivity to androgen_deprivation therapies (NCCN Prostate Cancer Guidelines, v3.2022)(Corn et al., 2019; 31515154, Tsaur et al., 2019; 30875581, Spetsieris et al., 2020; 33339136, Aparicio et al., 2013; 23649003, Aparicio et al., 2015; 26546618, Koczka et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 193, Aparicio et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5052). RB1 alterations have been associated with favorable outcomes of time to next treatment and OS for patients with castration_resistant prostate cancer treated with taxanes versus novel hormonal therapies such as abiraterone or enzalutamide (Graf et al., 2021; 34716049). On the basis of limited clinical data (Owonikoko et al., 2016; ESMO Abstract 14230) and strong preclinical data (Hook et al., 2012; 22222631, Gong et al., 2018; 30373917, Oser et al., 2018; 30373918), RB1 inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to inhibitors of Aurora kinase A, particularly in small cell lung cancer. It should be noted that a trial of the Aurora kinase A inhibitor alisertib in advanced prostate cancer did not find an association between RB1 deletion and clinical benefit (Beltran et al., 2019; 30232224). Other approaches to target RB1 inactivation under investigation in preclinical studies include inhibitors of BCL_2 family members (Allaman_Pillet et al., 2013; 21955141) and activation of the NOTCH pathway (Viatour et al., 2011; 21875955). Rb inactivation may predict resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors such as palbociclib, abemaciclib, and ribociclib, which act upstream of Rb (Condorelli et al., 2018; 29236940, Fry et al., 2004; 15542782, Dean et al., 2010; 20473330, Dean et al., 2012; 22767154, Garnett et al., 2012; 22460902, Roberts et al., 2012; 22302033, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27217383, O\u2019Leary et al., 2018; 30206110, Costa et al., 2020; 31594766, Chen et al., 2018; 29059158). Loss of Rb function has been associated with increased sensitivity to cytotoxic agents and chemotherapeutics in both preclinical studies and in patients with bladder or breast cancer (Derenzini et al., 2008; 18381962, Knudsen and Knudsen, 2008; 19143056). Post_hoc analysis of a Phase 2 trial in metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer suggests that patients with aggressive variant prostate cancer (AVPC), molecularly characterized by harboring alterations in at least 2 genes of TP53, RB1, and PTEN, as seen in this sample, may benefit from cabazitaxel combined with carboplatin compared with cabazitaxel alone (median PFS of 5.1 vs. 2.2 months, p=0.03; estimated median OS of 11.2 vs. 10.5 months, p=0.11), whereas patients who were AVPC_negative did not benefit from the more intense chemotherapy combination in this study (Corn et al., 2019; 31515154). Mutations in RB1 underlie the development of retinoblastoma (RB), a rare tumor that arises at a rate of approximately 1:20,000 live births, with nearly 5,000 new cases worldwide per year (Chen et al., 2014; 24282159). Germline mutations in RB1 account for approximately 40% of RB tumors (Yun et al., 2011; 22553621) and are associated with an increased risk of developing secondary malignancies that include soft tissue and bone sarcoma and malignant melanoma (Houston et al., 2011; 21139478, Ng et al., 2010; 19959033). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of RB1 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "L194R", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "L194R"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 mutations have been reported in 18_40% of prostate cancers (Kumar et al., 2011; 21949389, Beltran et al., 2013; 22981675). Overexpression of p53, which is indicative of TP53 dysregulation, has been reported to be significantly more common in late_stage and hormone_refractory prostate cancers and has been found to be associated with prostate_specific antigen (PSA) recurrence in low_ and intermediate_grade prostate cancer (Schlomm et al., 2008; 18552821). TP53 loss has been found to be associated with prostate cancer_specific mortality in univariate analysis (Liu et al., 2013; 23609948). Concurrent alterations in at least 2 of the TP53, RB1, and PTEN genes, as seen in this sample, molecularly define a subtype of prostate cancer with aggressive clinical course and reduced sensitivity to androgen_deprivation therapies (NCCN Prostate Cancer Guidelines, v3.2022)(Corn et al., 2019; 31515154, Tsaur et al., 2019; 30875581, Spetsieris et al., 2020; 33339136, Aparicio et al., 2013; 23649003, Aparicio et al., 2015; 26546618, Koczka et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 193, Aparicio et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5052). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may also be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as APR_246 (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571, Lehmann et al., 2012; 22965953, Mohell et al., 2015; 26086967, Franssonet al., 2016; 27179933). In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, APR_246 combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. Post_hoc analysis of a Phase 2 trial in metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer suggests that patients with aggressive variant prostate cancer (AVPC), molecularly characterized by harboring alterations in at least 2 genes of TP53, RB1, and PTEN, as seen in this sample, may benefit from cabazitaxel combined with carboplatin compared with cabazitaxel alone (median PFS of 5.1 vs. 2.2 months, p=0.03; estimated median OS of 11.2 vs. 10.5 months, p=0.11), whereas patients who were AVPC_negative did not benefit from the more intense chemotherapy combination in this study (Corn et al., 2019; 31515154). Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "01", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "01"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB level associated with lower rates of clinical benefit from treatment with PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors compared with patients with tumors harboring higher TMB levels, based on several studies in multiple solid tumor types (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). Prostate acinar adenocarcinoma harbors a median TMB of 2.7 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 3.4% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb) (FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). Prostate cancer has been reported to harbor a relatively low TMB among solid tumors (Lawrence et al., 2013; 23770567, Alexandrov et al., 2013; 23945592), with approximately 0.5_1.5 (muts/Mb) in localized tumor samples (Barbieri et al., 2012; 22610119, Baca et al., 2013; 23622249, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26544944), and a higher but still low TMB of 2_5 muts/Mb in metastatic, castration_resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) samples (Grasso et al., 2012; 22722839, Gundem et al., 2015; 25830880, cBio_Robinson et al., 2015; 26000489). One study reported that 4 of 150 (2.7%) mCRPC cases harbored high TMB (nearly 50 muts/Mb), which was due to defects in mismatch repair genes MLH1 and MSH2 in 3 of the 4 cases (cBio_Robinson et al., 2015; 26000489). The effects of hypermutation on prognosis and clinical features in prostate cancer have not been extensively investigated (PubMed, Feb 2022). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, higher TMB has been reported to be associated with increased ORR and OS from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). Higher TMB was found to be significantly associated with improved OS upon immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment for patients with 9 types of advanced tumors (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254). Analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy, compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386). However, the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors found significant improvement in ORR for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (based on this assay or others) compared to those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb, in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types; similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). Together, these studies suggest that patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb may derive clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1 inhibitors. The Phase 2 CheckMate 650 trial of nivolumab and ipilimumab treatment for patients with metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer reported that patients harboring above the median study TMB experienced increased ORR and PSA responses (Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": null, "References": {"Reference": [{"number": "0", "ReferenceId": "18650841", "FullCitation": "Burkhart DL, et al.
