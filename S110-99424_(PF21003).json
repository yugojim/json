Alterations such as seen here may disrupt BRCA1 function or expression (Nelson et al., 2010; 20681793, Silver and Livingston, 2012; 22843421, Ludwig et al., 2001; 11358863). BRCA1 mutations have been reported in 1% of glioblastoma cases analyzed (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). Multiple cases of glioblastoma in patients with germline BRCA1 mutation and prior history of breast cancer have been described (Raugi et al., 2017; 28382102, Boukerroucha et al., 2015; 25880076, Elmariah et al., 2006; 16958968). A germline BRCA1 mutation has also been reported in a patient with oligodendroglioma (Johannsson et al., 1996; 8644702). One study reported that presence of BRCA mutations was associated with significantly shorter OS in male patients with glioma; among patients with BRCA_mutant tumors, there was no difference in OS among those with BRCA1 mutations, BRCA2 mutations, or both (Sun et al., 2020; 33054725). Alterations that inactivate BRCA1 or BRCA2 may confer sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Kaufman et al., 2015; 25366685, Mateo et al., 2015; 26510020, Tutt et al., 2010; 20609467, Robson et al., 2017; 28578601, Mirza et al., 2016; 27717299, Sandhu et al., 2013; 23810788, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594, Drew et al., 2016; 27002934, Pujade_Lauraine et al., 2017; 28754483, Ledermann et al., 2016; 27617661, Fong et al., 2009; 19553641, Audeh et al., 2010; 20609468, Fong et al., 2010; 20406929, Gelmon et al., 2011; 21862407, Kaye et al., 2012; 22203755, Domchek et al., 2016; 26723501, Moore et al., 2018; 30345884, Golan et al., 2019; 31157963) or ATR inhibitors (Yap et al., 2020; 32988960, Thomas et al., 2018; 29252124, O Carrigan et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2504, Yap et al., 2016; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract 1LBA, Saito et al., 2018; 31299005). Clinical responses to PARP inhibitors have been reported for patients with either germline or somatic BRCA1/2 mutations (Mateo et al., 2015; 26510020, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594, Ledermann et al., 2016; 27617661, Moore et al., 2018; 30345884, Golan et al., 2019; 31157963) and for patients with platinum_resistant or _refractory disease (Fong et al., 2010; 20406929, Kaufman et al., 2015; 25366685, Sandhu et al., 2013; 23810788, Domchek et al., 2016; 26723501). In a Phase 1 trial of monotherapy treatment with the ATR inhibitor BAY1895344, 2 patients with deleterious BRCA1 alterations and platinum_refractory ovarian carcinoma experienced a PR or prolonged SD (Yap et al., 2020; 32988960). In other Phase 1 trials of combination approaches, a patient with BRCA1_mutated ovarian carcinoma experienced prolonged SD from the ATR inhibitor berzosertib combined with topotecan (Thomas et al., 2018; 29252124); another patient with platinum_ and PARP_inhibitory refractory ovarian cancer and an inactivating germline BRCA1 mutation experienced a PR from berzosertib plus carboplatin (O Carrigan et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2504); and a third patient with BRCA1_mutated triple_negative breast cancer (TNBC) experienced a PR to the ATR inhibitor ceralasertib combined with olaparib (Yap et al., 2016; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract 1LBA). Preclinical studies of BRCA1/2 inactivation in T_cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T_ALL) (Pouliot et al., 2019; 31721781), ovarian carcinoma (Kim et al., 2017; 27993965), and TNBC (Jin et al., 2018; 29605721) showing reduced cell viability and increased DNA damage during ATR treatment further support the sensitivity of BRCA1_deficient cells to ATR inhibitors. In a Phase 1 monotherapy trial of the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib that included 9 patients with BRCA1/2_mutated solid tumors, 2 patients with BRCA1_mutated cancers (1 with ovarian serous carcinoma and 1 with oral squamous cell carcinoma) achieved PRs, and a third patient with ovarian serous carcinoma harboring mutations in BRCA1 and TP53 experienced 14% tumor shrinkage prior to disease progression (Do et al., 2015; 25964244). Inactivation of BRCA1 may also predict sensitivity to the DNA_damaging agents trabectedin and lurbinectedin (Cruz et al., 2018; 30240327, Awada et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 1072, Poveda et al., 2017; 28368437, Garcia et al., 2013; 23364677, Sch\u00f6ffski et al., 2011; 21376569, Aracil et al., 2014; Abstract 35, Italiano et al., 2011; 21287534, Laroche_Clary et al., 2015; 25602962, Ghouadni et al., 2017; 28467918, Tedesco et al., 2011; ASCO Abstract 1125, Monk et al., 2015; 25722380, Monk et al., 2020; 31924332, Yasui et al., 2016; 27077926). Inactivating germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 are associated with autosomal dominant hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (Miki et al., 1994; 7545954, Wooster et al., 1995; 8524414), and the lifetime risk of breast and ovarian cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers has been estimated to be as high as 87% and 44%, respectively (Ford et al., 1994; 7907678). Elevated risk for other cancer types, including gastric, pancreatic, prostate, and colorectal, has also been identified, with an increase in risk ranging from 20 to 60% (Friedenson, 2005; 16369438). The estimated prevalence of deleterious germline BRCA1/2 mutations in the general population is between 1:400 and 1:800, with an approximately 10_fold higher prevalence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (Ford et al., 1994; 7907678, Whittemore et al., 1997; 9042908, Claus et al., 1996; 8635102, Struewing et al., 1997; 9145676, Oddoux et al., 1996; 8841192, King et al., 2003; 14576434, Hall et al., 2009; 19241424).

An additional case study reported a durable response (>2 years) to combination olaparib and temozolomide in a pediatric patient with glioblastoma (Valiakhmetova et al., 2020; 32043779). Olaparib has been studied primarily for the treatment of ovarian cancer, with response rates often significantly higher for patients with BRCA mutations than for those without (Fong et al., 2009; 19553641, Gelmon et al., 2011; 21862407); higher response rates have also been observed for patients with platinum_sensitive versus platinum_resistant cancer (Domchek et al., 2016; 26723501, Matulonis et al., 2016; 26961146, Gelmon et al., 2011; 21862407, Fong et al., 2010; 20406929). As maintenance therapy for patients with newly diagnosed or platinum_sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer, olaparib has demonstrated significantly improved median PFS and median OS compared with placebo in the Phase 3 SOLO_1 study (Moore et al., 2018; 30345884) and in multiple later_phase studies (Pujade_Lauraine et al., 2017; 28754483, Ledermann et al., 2016; 27617661, Ledermann et al., 2012; 22452356, Ledermann et al., 2014; 24882434).

This alteration causes an in_frame deletion of 801 base pairs encoding part of the extracellular ligand_binding domain (Nishikawa et al., 1994; 8052651). This deletion has shown to result in ligand_independent (constitutive) phosphorylation and activation of EGFR, as well as consequent tumorigenesis (Nishikawa et al., 1994; 8052651, Nedergaard et al., 2012; 22385404). Across several genomic studies of CNS tumors, EGFR alterations have been reported in 13.2% of anaplastic astrocytomas, 5.3_15.9% of glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs), and 0% of pilocytic astrocytomas (cbio_Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031, cbio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, cbio_Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, cbio_Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509). Across several genomic studies of CNS tumors, EGFR amplification has been reported in 16.9% of anaplastic astrocytomas, and 39.7% of glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs)(Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031, Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509). In the glioblastoma (GBM) TCGA dataset, putative high_level amplification of EGFR has been found in 48% of cases and mutation has been found in 21% of cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). Missense mutations in the EGFR extracellular domain have been found in 10_15% of GBMs and approximately half have a low_level amplification of the mutated allele (Lee et al., 2006; 17177598, Vivanco et al., 2012; 22588883). One study detected EGFR alterations in 50% (117/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed, including 41% (95/232) with a co_occurring EGFR amplification and mutation, 26% (61/232) with an EGFR domain truncation event, such as EGFRvIII, and 2.2% (5/232) with an EGFR fusion event (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). The EGFRvIII mutation has been variously reported in 6_46% of GBM samples (Nishikawa et al., 1994; 8052651, Shinojima et al., 2003; 14583498, Nishikawa et al., 2004; 15700833, Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176, Viana_Pereira et al., 2008; 18507036, Yoshimoto et al., 2008; 18223223, Larysz et al., 2011; 21455841, Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251, Lv et al., 2012; 22752145). No definitive correlation has been identified between EGFR amplification and length of survival in patients with GBM (Srividya et al., 2010; 20702468, Das et al., 2011; 20888234); however, EGFR amplification has been associated with prolonged survival in patients over the age of 60 with GBM (Smith et al., 2001; 11504770). The link between EGFRvIII status and prognosis is unclear, although some studies suggest that it may be linked to improved survival and response to chemotherapy (Montano et al., 2011; 22241957). Clinical studies of the second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified gliomas have shown limited efficacy (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Blumenthal et al., 2016; 27531351); however, a small subset of patients has experienced clinical benefit (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). The second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib have shown minimal efficacy for patients with EGFRvIII glioblastoma (GBM)(Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Alshami et al., 2015; 26423602, Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). A Phase 1/2 study of afatinib, temozolomide, or the combination for patients with GBM reported clinical benefit, including for patients with EGFRvIII; however, temozolomide alone and in combination exhibited better responses than afatinib monotherapy (Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Alshami et al., 2015; 26423602). A Phase 2 trial of dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified GBM reported a DCR of 26% (5/19) among patients with EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII; however, the trial failed to meet its primary endpoint of 6_month PFS (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464). A retrospective biomarker analysis of another Phase 2 study of dacomitinib for patients with GBM found no association between EGFRvIII and clinical benefit (Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). A Phase 1 trial of ABT_414, an EGFR_targeted antibody_drug conjugate with a toxic payload, in patients with GBM reported 2 complete responses (CR) and 5 partial responses (PR) in 18 patients with EGFR amplification (39% response rate); no CR or PR were observed in 28 patients without EGFR amplification (Gan et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 2016). A clinical study of patients with GBM treated with gefitinib or erlotinib found no correlation between EGFR amplification or mutation and response to the therapy, but sensitivity to EGFR kinase inhibitors was associated with the co_expression of the EGFRvIII alteration and PTEN (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176). Activation of multiple ERBB family receptors or activation of the PI3K pathway may be responsible for resistance to EGFR_targeted therapy in GBM; therefore, inhibition of ERBB family members or treatment with PI3K/AKT inhibitors or mTOR inhibitors such as everolimus or temsirolimus in combination with an EGFR_targeted treatment, may be a therapeutic option (Clark et al., 2012; 22745588, Fenton et al., 2012; 22891331). In multiple glioblastoma studies, the presence of EGFRvIII has not predicted clinical benefit from erlotinib or gefitinib (Van den Bent et al., 2009; 19204207, Rich et al. 2004; 14638850, Ulm et al., 2011; 20510539, Haas_Kogen et al., 2005; 15956649, Arif et al., 2018; 29492119, Gallego et al., 2013; 24352766). In a retrospective study of patients with glioblastoma treated with erlotinib or gefitinib, co_expression of EGFRvIII with PTEN protein was the strongest predictor of response (P<0.001)(Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176), suggesting that activity in this setting is dependent on PTEN status (Mellinghoff et al., 2007; 17255257). However, a prospective Phase 2 trial testing erlotinib monotherapy for patients with EGFRvIII and PTEN_positive recurrent glioblastoma reported minimal efficacy and was terminated (Gallego et al., 2013; 24352766). Multiple studies have failed to find a positive association between increased EGFR expression and clinical benefit from erlotinib or gefitinib for patients with glioblastoma (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176, Franceschi et al., 2007; 17353924, Chakravarti et al., 2013; 23182702, Hegi et al., 2011; 21471286, Rich et al. 2004; 14638850). Case studies of patients with cancers harboring EGFR rearrangements treated with osimertinib have reported mixed results. Of 3 patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR kinase domain duplication (KDD), 2 attained PRs with osimertinib, whereas the third experienced PD (Wang et al., 2018; 30255937, Kim et al., 2021; DOI: 10.1200/PO.20.00296). A patient with multiple glioblastoma (GBM) tumors, one of which harbored EGFRvIII, experienced progression of the EGFRvIII_positive tumor during treatment with osimertinib (Makhlin et al., 2019; 31769726). Third_generation EGFR inhibitors, such as osimertinib, selectively target mutated EGFR, including EGFR T790M (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549, Soria et al., 2018; 29151359). EGFR amplification or expression may be associated with benefit from anti_EGFR antibodies, such as cetuximab (Pirker et al., 2011; 22056021, Jiang et al., 2013; 23441167, Licitra et al., 2011; 21048039, Herbst et al., 2018; 29169877), panitumumab (Jiang et al., 2013; 23441167), or necitumumab (Paz_Ares et al., 2016; 27207107). Necitumumab is an anti_EGFR antibody that is approved to treat metastatic squamous NSCLC in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin (Thatcher et al., 2015; 26045340, Paz_Ares et al., 2015; 25701171) that has also shown benefit in patients with CRC and melanoma (Elez et al., 2016; 26766738, Kuenen et al., 2010; 20197484). Irreversible EGFR inhibitors, as well as HSP90 inhibitors, may be appropriate for patients with de novo or acquired resistance to EGFR_targeted therapy (Shimamura et al., 2005; 16024644, Shimamura et al., 2008; 18632637, Sawai et al., 2008; 18199556, Janne et al., 2015; 25923649). Preclinical studies have reported that EGFR_mutant cells (Shimamura et al., 2005; 16024644, Shimamura et al., 2008; 18632637, Sawai et al., 2008; 18199556), including cells with exon 20 insertions (Xu et al., 2007; 17712310), are sensitive to HSP90 inhibitors. Consistent with preclinical data demonstrating that the EGFR inhibitor AZD3759 is capable of penetrating the blood_brain barrier and reducing the volume of brain and leptomeningeal metastases, preliminary results from a Phase 1 trial evaluating single_agent AZD3759 reported a reduction in the volume of brain metastases in 40.0% (8/20) of patients with previously treated NSCLC harboring either EGFR L858R or EGFR exon 19 deletion, including 3 confirmed PRs and 3 unconfirmed PRs (Ahn et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9003, Zeng et al., 2015; 26313252,Yang et al., 2016; 27928026). In a Phase 1/2 trial for advanced NSCLC, the brain_penetrant third_generation EGFR TKI lazertinib enabled ORRs of 54.3% (69/127) for all evaluable patients and 44.4% (8/18, intracranial) for patients with brain metastases (Ahn et al., 2019; ASCO 31587882). The reovirus Reolysin targets cells with activated RAS signaling (Strong et al., 1998; 9628872, Coffey et al., 1998; 9812900, Gong and Mita, 2014; 25019061) and is in clinical trials for patients with some tumor types. Reolysin has demonstrated mixed clinical efficacy, with the highest rate of response reported for patients with head and neck cancer (Forsyth et al., 2008; 18253152, Vidal et al., 2008; 18981012, Gollamudi et al., 2010; 19572105, Harrington et al., 2010; 20484020, Comins et al., 2010; 20926400, Lolkema et al., 2011; 21106728, Galanis et al., 2012; 22871663, Karapanagiotou et al., 2012; 22316603, Morris et al., 2013; 22886613). Novel approaches that specifically target EGFRvIII, such as the vaccine rindopepimut, are under investigation in both clinical and preclinical studies. Phase 2 studies of rindopepimut reported promising results, with increases in median overall survival (OS) for patients with newly diagnosed EGFRvIII_positive GBM treated with rindopepimut in combination with temozolomide compared to temozolomide alone after resection and chemoradiation (25 vs. 15_16 months)(Schuster et al., 2015; 25586468), as well as for patients with bevacizumab_na\u00efve relapsed EGFRvIII_positive GBM treated with rindopepimut in combination with bevacizumab compared to bevacizumab alone (12 vs. 8 months)(Reardon et al., 2015; SNO Annual Meeting Abstract IMCT_08). However, a Phase 3 study of rindopepimut combined with temozolomide compared to control in newly diagnosed resected EGFRvIII_positive GBM after chemoradiation was terminated after the second interim analysis, due to a lack of clinical benefit as measured by OS (20.1 vs. 20.0 months)(Weller et al., 2016; SNO Abstract ATIM_03).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

Third_generation EGFR inhibitors, such as osimertinib, selectively target mutated EGFR, including EGFR T790M (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549, Soria et al., 2018; 29151359). EGFR amplification or expression may be associated with benefit from anti_EGFR antibodies, such as cetuximab (Pirker et al., 2011; 22056021, Jiang et al., 2013; 23441167, Licitra et al., 2011; 21048039, Herbst et al., 2018; 29169877), panitumumab (Jiang et al., 2013; 23441167), or necitumumab (Paz_Ares et al., 2016; 27207107). Necitumumab is an anti_EGFR antibody that is approved to treat metastatic squamous NSCLC in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin (Thatcher et al., 2015; 26045340, Paz_Ares et al., 2015; 25701171) that has also shown benefit in patients with CRC and melanoma (Elez et al., 2016; 26766738, Kuenen et al., 2010; 20197484). Irreversible EGFR inhibitors, as well as HSP90 inhibitors, may be appropriate for patients with de novo or acquired resistance to EGFR_targeted therapy (Shimamura et al., 2005; 16024644, Shimamura et al., 2008; 18632637, Sawai et al., 2008; 18199556, Janne et al., 2015; 25923649). Preclinical studies have reported that EGFR_mutant cells (Shimamura et al., 2005; 16024644, Shimamura et al., 2008; 18632637, Sawai et al., 2008; 18199556), including cells with exon 20 insertions (Xu et al., 2007; 17712310), are sensitive to HSP90 inhibitors. Consistent with preclinical data demonstrating that the EGFR inhibitor AZD3759 is capable of penetrating the blood_brain barrier and reducing the volume of brain and leptomeningeal metastases, preliminary results from a Phase 1 trial evaluating single_agent AZD3759 reported a reduction in the volume of brain metastases in 40.0% (8/20) of patients with previously treated NSCLC harboring either EGFR L858R or EGFR exon 19 deletion, including 3 confirmed PRs and 3 unconfirmed PRs (Ahn et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9003, Zeng et al., 2015; 26313252,Yang et al., 2016; 27928026). In a Phase 1/2 trial for advanced NSCLC, the brain_penetrant third_generation EGFR TKI lazertinib enabled ORRs of 54.3% (69/127) for all evaluable patients and 44.4% (8/18, intracranial) for patients with brain metastases (Ahn et al., 2019; ASCO 31587882). The reovirus Reolysin targets cells with activated RAS signaling (Strong et al., 1998; 9628872, Coffey et al., 1998; 9812900, Gong and Mita, 2014; 25019061) and is in clinical trials for patients with some tumor types. Reolysin has demonstrated mixed clinical efficacy, with the highest rate of response reported for patients with head and neck cancer (Forsyth et al., 2008; 18253152, Vidal et al., 2008; 18981012, Gollamudi et al., 2010; 19572105, Harrington et al., 2010; 20484020, Comins et al., 2010; 20926400, Lolkema et al., 2011; 21106728, Galanis et al., 2012; 22871663, Karapanagiotou et al., 2012; 22316603, Morris et al., 2013; 22886613). Novel approaches that specifically target EGFRvIII, such as the vaccine rindopepimut, are under investigation in both clinical and preclinical studies. Phase 2 studies of rindopepimut reported promising results, with increases in median overall survival (OS) for patients with newly diagnosed EGFRvIII_positive GBM treated with rindopepimut in combination with temozolomide compared to temozolomide alone after resection and chemoradiation (25 vs. 15_16 months)(Schuster et al., 2015; 25586468), as well as for patients with bevacizumab_na\u00efve relapsed EGFRvIII_positive GBM treated with rindopepimut in combination with bevacizumab compared to bevacizumab alone (12 vs. 8 months)(Reardon et al., 2015; SNO Annual Meeting Abstract IMCT_08). However, a Phase 3 study of rindopepimut combined with temozolomide compared to control in newly diagnosed resected EGFRvIII_positive GBM after chemoradiation was terminated after the second interim analysis, due to a lack of clinical benefit as measured by OS (20.1 vs. 20.0 months)(Weller et al., 2016; SNO Abstract ATIM_03).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

Both p15INK4b and p16INK4a bind to and inhibit CDK4 and CDK6, thereby maintaining the growth_suppressive activity of the Rb tumor suppressor; loss or inactivation of either p15INK4b or p16INK4a contributes to dysregulation of the CDK4/6_cyclin_Rb pathway and loss of cell cycle control (Gazzeri et al., 1998; 9484839, Roussel, 1999; 10498883). The tumor suppressive functions of p14ARF involve stabilization and activation of p53, via a mechanism of MDM2 inhibition (Sherr et al., 2005; 16869746, Ozenne et al., 2010; 20549699). One or more alterations observed here are predicted to result in p16INK4a loss of function (Ruas et al., 1999; 10498896, Jones et al., 2007; 17909018, Haferkamp et al., 2008; 18843795, Huot et al., 2002; 12417717, Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Gombart et al., 1997; 9324288, Yang et al., 1995; 7780957, Parry and Peters, 1996; 8668202, Greenblatt et al., 2003; 12606942, Yarbrough et al., 1999; 10491434, Poi et al., 2001; 11255261, Byeon et al., 1998; 9660926, Kannengiesser et al., 2009; 19260062, Lal et al., 2000; 10719365, Koh et al., 1995; 7777061, McKenzie et al., 2010; 20340136, Miller et al., 2011; 21462282, Arap et al., 1997; 905385, Scaini et al., 2014; 24659262, Jenkins et al., 2013; 23190892, Walker et al., 1999; 10389768, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). One or more alterations seen here are predicted to result in p14ARF loss of function (Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Itahana and Zhang, 2008; 18538737, Zhang and Xiong, 1999; 10360174, Zhang et al., 1998; 9529249, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). Concurrent putative homozygous deletion of CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been reported in 35% of patients with gliomas (cBio_Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661) and detected more frequently in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; 58%)(cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142) than in those with lower grade gliomas (13%) (cBioPortal, Sep 2020)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). In other studies, loss of CDKN2A/B by deletion has been reported in up to 78% of astrocytomas (including anaplastic astrocytomas and GBM) (Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Weber et al., 2007; 16909113). A study found homozygous deletion of both p16INK4a and p14ARF in 26% (13/50) of glioblastomas (GBMs); 18% (9/50) of cases showed homozygous deletion of the p14ARF_encoding locus alone (Nakamura et al., 2001; 11303791). One study detected CDKN2A/B loss in 69% (161/232) and mutation in 2.6% (6/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Decreased p14ARF and p16INK4a expression levels were found to be tightly associated in a study of glioma samples (Chakravarti et al., 2001; 11489817). Homozygous deletion of the genomic region including CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been found to be associated with poor prognosis in GBM and likely serves as an early event in GBM progression (Feng et al., 2012; 21713760, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337). In addition, expression of p16INK4a has been found to be lower in patients with high grade malignant gliomas compared to patients with low grade gliomas, and loss of p16INK4a expression has been associated with shorter overall survival in pilocytic astrocytomas (Raabe et al., 2011; 21636552, Liu et al., 2011; 21843312). Preclinical data suggest that tumors with loss of p16INK4a function may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, ribociclib, and palbociclib (Konecny et al., 2011; 21278246, Katsumi et al., 2011; 21871868, Cen et al., 2012; 22711607, Logan et al., 2013; 23898052). Although case studies have reported that patients with breast cancer or uterine leiomyosarcoma harboring CDKN2A loss responded to palbociclib treatment (Elvin et al., 2017; 28283584, Gao et al., 2015; 26715889), multiple other clinical studies have shown no significant correlation between p16INK4a loss or inactivation and therapeutic benefit of these agents (Gopalan et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8077, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Konecny et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5557)(DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Johnson et al., 2014; 24797823); it is not known whether CDK4/6 inhibitors would be beneficial in this case. Although preclinical studies have suggested that loss of p14ARF function may be associated with reduced sensitivity to MDM2 inhibitors (Van Maerken et al., 2011; 21460101, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357), the clinical relevance of p14ARF as a predictive biomarker is not clear. Germline CDKN2A mutation is associated with melanoma_pancreatic cancer syndrome, a condition marked by increased risk of developing malignant melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer (Whelan et al., 1995; 7666917). Mutation carriers within families may develop either or both types of cancer, and melanoma cases may be referred to as familial or hereditary melanoma (Hansson, 2010; 20687502, Hogg et al., 1998; 9479083). CDKN2A is the most implicated gene in familial melanoma, with germline mutations present in 16% to 20% of familial melanoma cases (De Unamuno et al., 2018; 29543703, Soura et al., 2016; 26892650, Huerta et al., 2018; 29405243). CDKN2A alteration has also been implicated in familial melanoma_astrocytoma syndrome, an extremely rare tumor association characterized by dual predisposition to melanoma and nervous system tumors (Kaufman et al., 1993; 8414022, Bahuau et al., 1998; 9622062, Chan et al., 2017; 28699883).

One study reported FLT3 mRNA expression in 14/14 glioblastoma samples analyzed (E\u00dfbach et al., 2013; 23737671). In another study, FLT3 mRNA expression was not reported in any of five glioblastoma cell lines analyzed (Serve et al., 1999; 10087327). One study of glioma reported reduced OS (HR=19.46, p<0.0001) for patients with FLT3 mutation compared to those without (Shee et al., 2020; 32583303).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947).

A large_scale study did not find high_level microsatellite instability (MSI_H) in any of 129 GBM samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), although a small_scale study reported MSI_H in 4 of 15 pediatric GBMs and 1 of 12 adult GBMs (Szybka et al., 2003; 12908754).

TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Touat et al., 2020; 32322066, Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556, Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642). Glioblastoma (GBM) harbors a median TMB of 2.7 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 4.2% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). For pediatric patients, high TMB has been reported in a subset of high_grade gliomas, frequently in association with mutations in mismatch repair or proofreading genes and in TP53, whereas BRAF alterations or other oncogene fusions were observed more frequently in brain tumors harboring low TMB (Patel et al., 2020; 32386112, Johnson et al., 2017; 28912153). Increased TMB has been reported to correlate with higher tumor grade in glioma (Draaisma et al., 2015; 26699864) and glioblastoma (GBM) tissue samples with biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD) (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570), as well as with shorter OS of patients with diffuse glioma (Wang et al., 2020; 32164609). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In glioma, a lack of association between TMB and clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors has been reported (Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Touat et al., 2020; 32322066). However, multiple case studies have reported that patients with ultramutated gliomas driven by POLE mutations have benefited from treatment with anti_PD_1 (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556) or anti_PD_L1 (Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642) therapies. Therefore, although increased TMB alone may not be a strong biomarker for PD_1 or PD_L1 inhibitors in this cancer type, these agents may have efficacy for patients with glioma harboring both high TMB and POLE mutation.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene":
