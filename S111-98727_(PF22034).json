Mutation, loss, or inactivation of ARID1A has been reported in many cancers, and the gene is considered a tumor suppressor (Guan et al., 2011; 21900401, Jones et al., 2012; 22009941, Wiegand et al., 2010; 20942669, Jones et al., 2010; 20826764, Yan et al., 2014; 24293408, Wang et al., 2012; 22808142, Huang et al., 2012; 22922871, Chan_On et al., 2013; 24185513, Mamo et al., 2012; 21892209). ARID1A mutations, which are mostly truncating, have been identified along the entire gene and often correlate with ARID1A protein loss (Jones et al., 2012; 22009941, Wiegand et al., 2010; 20942669, Jones et al., 2010; 20826764, Zang et al., 2012; 22484628, Wang et al., 2011; 22037554), whereas ARID1A missense mutations are mostly uncharacterized. ARID1A alterations are particularly prevalent in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (46_50%), ovarian and uterine endometrioid carcinomas (24_44%), and cholangiocarcinoma (27%); they are also reported in up to 27% of gastric carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, pediatric Burkitt lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, and urothelial carcinoma samples analyzed (COSMIC, cBioPortal, Jan 2022) (Tate et al., 2019; 30371878, Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Wu et al., 2014; 24618703, Jones et al., 2012; 22009941, Dulak et al., 2013; 23525077, Streppel et al., 2013; 23318448, Jiao et al., 2014; 24293293, Ross et al., 2014; 24563076). ARID1A loss is associated with microsatellite instability in ovarian and endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinomas (Huang et al., 2014; 25195947, Hussein et al., 2014; 25394778, Bosse et al., 2013; 23702729, Allo et al., 2014; 23887303, Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729), CRC (Chou et al., 2014; 24925223, Ye et al., 2014; 25311944, Wei et al., 2014; 25561809, Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729), and gastric cancer (Chen et al., 2015; 25583476, Wang et al., 2011; 22037554, Abe et al., 2012; 22915242, Wang et al., 2012; 22808142, Wiegand et al., 2014; 24767857, Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729). In the context of urothelial carcinomas, one study reported no association between ARID1A mutation and tumor grade (Gui et al., 2011; 21822268), whereas others have reported contradictory associations between ARID1A protein loss and prognosis (Balb\u00e1s_Mart\u00ednez et al., 2013; 23650517, Faraj et al., 2014; 25175170). There are no therapies approved to address the mutation or loss of ARID1A in cancer. However, on the basis of limited clinical and preclinical evidence, ARID1A inactivating mutations may lead to sensitivity to ATR inhibitors such as M6620 and ceralasertib (Williamson et al., 2016; 27958275). In a Phase 2 study of ceralasertib in solid tumors, 2 patients with endometrial carcinoma in the cohort with loss of ARID1A expression achieved CRs on ceralasertib monotherapy; at least 1 of these 2 patients carried an inactivating ARID1A mutation. In contrast, no responses were observed for patients with normal ARID1A expression treated with ceralasertib combined with olaparib (Aggarwal et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 512O). One patient with small cell lung cancer harboring an ARID1A mutation experienced a PR when treated with M6620 combined with topotecan (Thomas et al., 2018; 29252124). In a Phase 1 trial, a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer harboring both an ARID1A mutation and ATM loss treated with single_agent M6620 achieved a CR that was ongoing at 29 months (Yap et al., 2020; 32568634). On the basis of limited preclinical evidence from studies in ovarian cancer, ARID1A inactivation may predict sensitivity to EZH2 inhibitors (Bitler et al., 2015; 25686104, Kim et al., 2015; 26552009), which are under investigation in clinical trials. Other studies have reported that the loss of ARID1A may activate the PI3K_AKT pathway and be linked with sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway (Wiegand et al., 2014; 24559118, Huang et al., 2014; 24336158, Samartzis et al., 2014; 24979463). Patients with ARID1A alterations in advanced or metastatic solid tumors may derive benefit from treatment with anti_PD_1 or anti_PD_L1 immunotherapy (Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729). Loss of ARID1A expression has been associated with chemoresistance to platinum_based therapy for patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma (Yokoyama et al., 2014; 24459582, Katagiri et al., 2012; 22101352) and to 5_fluorouracil in colorectal cancer cell lines (Xie et al., 2014; 24833095). Limited clinical evidence indicates that ARID1A_altered urothelial cancer may be sensitive to pan_HDAC inhibitors; a retrospective analysis reported a CR to belinostat and a PR to panobinostat in patients with ARID1A alterations (Gupta et al., 2019; 30301863).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "ARID1A loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to ATR inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04768296", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02264678", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04657068", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04802174", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02595931", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04514497", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04266912", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03978624", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03669601", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT01543763", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "ERBB2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "S310F", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "S310F"}}, "Interpretation": "ERBB2 (also known as HER2) encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase which is in the same family as EGFR. S310 is located in the HER2 extracellular domain and mutations at this position, including S310F and S310Y, have been reported to be activating (Greulich et al., 2012; 22908275, Lee et al., 2006; 17177598). In clinical studies, patients with the ERBB2 S310F mutation have benefited from ERBB2_targeted therapies including trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and lapatinib (Chumsri et al., 2015; 26358791, Ali et al., 2014; 24516025); a patient with concurrent EGFR L858R and ERBB2 S310F mutations also reported a complete and durable response to the dual EGFR/ERBB2 inhibitor afatinib (Jia et al., 2014; 24835218). ERBB2 mutations and amplification have been found in 9_10% and 5_9% of bladder urothelial carcinoma samples (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 24476821, Guo et al., 2013; 24121792), and amplifications have been reported at a higher frequency in lymph node metastases (La\u00e9 et al., 2010; 19889613, Fleischmann et al., 2011; 21640482). One study reported enrichment for ERBB2 mutations in micropapillary urothelial carcinoma (MPUC; 40% of samples), as compared with non_MPUC urothelial carcinomas (9% of samples)(Ross et al., 2014; 24192927). HER2 overexpression has been identified in 19% of bladder urothelial cancers with enrichment in Grade 3 and muscle_invasive tumors (Gardiner et al., 1992; 1348155, Gandour_Edwards et al., 2002; 12209684). Studies have generally reported inconsistent results with respect to the prognostic value of HER2 expression in patients with bladder urothelial carcinoma (Tsai et al., 2012; 22991510).

Neratinib has been largely evaluated in the context of breast cancer and non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For patients with advanced HER2_positive breast cancer, neratinib treatment resulted in PFS of 22.3 weeks for patients with prior trastuzumab treatment and 39.6 weeks for those with no prior trastuzumab treatment (Burstein et al., 2010; 20142587). In patients with HER2_positive breast cancer with brain metastases, neratinib elicited a CNS ORR of 8% (3/40) (Freedman et al., 2016; 26834058). In a Phase 3 study of patients with HER2_positive, early stage breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab, neratinib significantly improved the 2_year invasive disease_free survival compared to placebo (HR=0.67, p=0.0091)(Chan et al., 2016; 26874901). In Phase 2 trials of single_agent neratinib for patients with ERBB2_mutated, non_amplified metastatic breast cancer, clinical benefit rates of 31_40% and median PFS of 3.5_4 months have been achieved (Ma et al., 2017; 28679771, Hyman et al., 2018; 29420467, Smyth et al., 2019; 31806627). Neratinib in combination with various other agents has also shown significant clinical activity against breast cancer (Hyman et al., 2016; SABCS Abstract PD2_08)(Saura et al., 2014; 25287822, Awada et al., 2012; 22967996, Martin et al., 2013; 23953056, Chow et al., 2013; 23632474, Park et al., 2016; 27406346, Awada et al., 2016; 27078022).

Several FGFR3 germline alterations, including A391E, G380R, S249C, Y373C, and K650 mutations, have been associated with skeletal dysplasias of varying severity (Meyers et al., 1995; 7493034, Passos_Bueno et al., 1999; 10425034, Monsonego_Ornan et al., 2000; 10611230, Wilcox et al., 1998; 9677066, Foldynova_Trantirkova et al., 2012; 22045636, Junker et al., 2008; 18231634, Chesi et al., 2001; 11157491, Logi\u00e9 et al., 2005; 15772091, Bakkar et al., 2010; 19722178, Adar et al., 2002; 12009017, Katsumata et al., 1998; 9790257, Rousseau et al., 1996; 8845844, Tavormina et al., 1995; 8589699, Rousseau et al., 1996; 8845844, Bellus et al., 2000; 11055896). FGFR3 mutation and amplification have been reported in 26_59% and 18% of bladder urothelial carcinoma cases, respectively (van Oers et al., 2009; 18584939, Gust et al., 2013; 23657946, Dodurga et al., 2011; 21264819, The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014; 24476821). FGFR3 mutations are detected more frequently in upper tract urothelial carcinoma (26_40%) compared to bladder urothelial carcinoma (19_26%) (Necchi et al., 2020; 32861617, Audenet et al., 2018; 30352907, Sfakianos et al., 2015; 26278805). S249C has been reported to be the most frequent FGFR3 mutation in urothelial tumors, with similar incidences of 62% and 58% in bladder tumors and upper urothelial tract tumors, respectively (van Oers et al., 2009; 18584939). FGFR3 and TP53 have been reported to be the most frequently mutated genes in bladder cancer, and it has been suggested that urothelial carcinomas develop through at least two molecular pathways: one related to FGFR3, typically in less invasive tumors, and one related to TP53, characterized by higher grade invasive tumors (Wu, 2005; 16110317). FGFR3 expression has been found in 70% of bladder urothelial carcinomas, with high expression in 36% and 22% of low_grade and high_grade samples, respectively (Gust et al., 2013; 23657946). FGFR3 mutation has been associated with low tumor stage in bladder tumors and with a lower risk of death in patients with bladder tumors by univariate analysis but not multivariate analysis (van Oers et al., 2009; 18584939). Alterations that activate FGFR3 may predict sensitivity to selective FGFR kinase inhibitors, including erdafitinib (Loriot et al., 2019; 31340094, Tabernero et al., 2015; 26324363, Karkera et al., 2017; 28416604, Park et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 4117), pemigatinib (Necchi et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 900P), infigratinib (Pal et al., 2018; 29848605, Pal et al., 2020; 32208524), rogaratinib (Schuler et al., 2019; 31405822), Debio 1347 (Nakanishi et al., 2015; 25589496, Voss et al., 2019; 30745300), and derazantinib (Papadopoulos et al., 2017; 28972963); multikinase inhibitors such as pazopanib (Bellmunt et al., 2018; 30220708, Palma et al., 2015; 25766722) and ponatinib (Gozgit et al., 2012; 22238366, Liao et al., 2013; 23786770); and vofatamab, an antibody targeting FGFR3 (Bellmunt et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 4534, Necchi et al., 2019; ASCO GU Abstract 409, Siefker_Radtke et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 4511). A study of the tumor immune microenvironment in urothelial bladder cancer found enhanced FGFR3 pathway activation in non_T_cell_inflamed tumors compared with T_cell_inflamed tumors, suggesting that FGFR3_altered tumors may be resistant to immunotherapy (Sweis et al., 2016; 27197067). However, clinical data from the IMvigor_210/211, CheckMate_275, and PURE_01 studies have not reported statistically significant associations between FGFR3 status and response to PD_1/PD_L1 inhibition (Wang et al., 2019; 31272788, Necchi et al., 2020; 32417369). Phase 2 studies have shown activity of erdafitinib, pemigatinib, and infigratinib in FGFR3_altered urothelial carcinoma with ORRs ranging from 25_40% (Loriot et al., 2019; 31340094, Necchi et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 900P, Pal et al., 2018; 29848605, Pal et al., 2020; 32208524). Early analysis of the Phase 2 FIERCE_21 study for patients with pretreated urothelial carcinoma harboring FGFR3 mutations or fusions showed better median PFS when vofatamab was combined with docetaxel relative to vofatamab alone (not reached vs. 4 months)(Necchi et al., 2019; ASCO GU Abstract 409). Interim analysis of the Phase 2 FIERCE_22 trial evaluating vofatamab combined with pembrolizumab for patients with pretreated urothelial cancer reported an ORR of 36% (8/22) with responses observed for 33% (5/15) and 43% (3/7) of patients with wildtype or mutated and/or rearranged FGFR3, respectively (Siefker_Radtke et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 4511). In a Phase 1 study, rogaratinib elicited an ORR of 24% (12/51, 1 CR) and a DCR of 73% (37/51) in advanced urothelial carcinoma with FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGFR3 mRNA overexpression (Schuler et al., 2019; 31405822).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "FGFR inhibitors may be relevant in tumors with alterations that activate FGFR3.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Infigratinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Infigratinib is a TKI that inhibits FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3.

Decreased expression of MTAP leads to MTA accumulation within tumor cells and their microenvironment (Kirovski et al., 2011; 21356366, Limm et al., 2013; 23265702, Stevens et al., 2009; 19097084), thereby reducing intracellular arginine methylation (Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473, Mavrakis et al., 2016; 26912361, Kryukov et al., 2016; 26912360) and altering cell signaling (Limm et al., 2014; 25087184, Stevens et al., 2009; 19097084). MTAP is located at 9p21, adjacent to CDKN2A and CDKN2B, with which it is frequently co_deleted in various cancers. Other alterations in MTAP are rare and have not been extensively characterized. MTAP loss/homozygous deletion as well as loss of expression has been reported in a wide variety of solid tumors and hematologic cancers (Wei et al., 2016; 27929028, Zhao and Zhao, 2016; 27556634); such events have been correlated with poor prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (Kirovski et al., 2011; 21356366), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (Huang et al., 2009; 19887491), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)(Marce et al., 2006; 16778103), melanoma (Meyer et al., 2010; 20500769, Wild et al., 2006; 16618867), gastric cancer (Kim et al., 2011; 21412930), myxofibrosarcoma (Li et al., 2014; 25426549), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (He et al., 2015; 26656376), ovarian carcinoma (Wei et al., 2016; 27929028) and non_small cell lung cancer (Su et al., 2014; 24969958). MTAP loss was not prognostic in pediatric B_cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (Mirebeau et al., 2006; 16818274) or in astrocytoma (Becker et al., 2015; 26088413). However, MTAP has also been reported to be overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (Snezhkina et al., 2016; 27433286), and MTAP retention is thought to be important for prostate cancer growth due to continuous supply of SAM (Bistulfi et al., 2016; 26910893). Germline SNPs in MTAP have been correlated with the development of cutaneous melanoma (Antonopoulou et al., 2015; 25407435, Mccioni et al., 2013; 23816148), esophageal cancer (Hyland et al., 2016; 26635288, Lin et al., 2017; 27960044), osteosarcoma (Zhi et al., 2016; 27994653), and CRC (Gu et al., 2013; 23361049). Preclinical and limited clinical evidence indicate that MTAP inactivation produces specific metabolic vulnerabilities. MTAP inactivation may confer sensitivity to MAT2A inhibitors (Heist et al., 2019; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract B116, Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473). A Phase 1 trial of MAT2A inhibitor AG_270 reported 1 PR and 2 SDs lasting longer than 6 months for patients with advanced solid tumors displaying MTAP loss (Heist et al., 2019; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract B116). Although preclinical data have suggested that MTAP loss sensitizes cells to PRMT5 inhibition (Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473, Mavrakis et al., 2016; 26912361, Kryukov et al., 2016; 2691236), MTAP loss may not be a biomarker of response to previously developed small_molecule SAM_uncompetitive PRMT5 inhibitors (Guccione and Richard, 2019; 31350521); dual PRMT1 and PRMT5 inhibition may be more effective (Fedoriw et al., 2019; 31257072, Srour et al., 2019; 31287990, Gao et al., 2019; 30916320). In preclinical cancer models, MTAP inactivation showed increased sensitivity to inhibitors of purine synthesis or purine analogs, especially upon addition of exogenous MTA, which is converted to adenine in normal cells, thereby providing competition to purine poisons lacking in MTAP_deficient cells (Hansen et al., 2019; 31040154, Tang et al., 2018; 29844120, Munshi et al., 2014; 24928612, de Oliveira et al., 2016; 26751376, Lubin and Lubin, 2009; 19478948, Tang et al., 2012; 22825330, Collins et al., 2012; 22252602, Bertino et al., 2011; 21301207, Coulthard et al., 2011; 21282358, Miyazaki et al., 2007; 17912432, Efferth et al., 2002; 11987241). A Phase 2 study of L_alanosine, an inhibitor of adenine synthesis, as a monotherapy for 65 patients with MTAP_deficient cancers reported no responses and stable disease in 23.6% (13/55) of patients (Kindler et al., 2009; 18618081).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "MTAP loss may predict sensitivity to MAT2A inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": {"nctId": "NCT03435250", "Include": "true"}}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TSC1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Q527*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Q527*"}}, "Interpretation": "TSC1 encodes the protein Hamartin, which interacts with Tuberin, the gene product of TSC2, to inhibit and regulate mTOR activity (Tee et al., 2003; 12906785, Inoki et al., 2003; 12869586). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TSC1 function or expression (Miloloza et al., 2000; 10915759, Hoogeveen_Westerveld et al., 2010; 20547222, Hodges et al., 2001; 11741833). TSC1 mutations have been reported in up to 9% of bladder urothelial carcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 24476821, van Tilborg et al., 2001; 11329144, Ross et al., 2013; 23887298, cBio_Iyer et al., 2012; 22923433, cBio_Van Allen et al., 2014; 25096233, cBio_Guo et al., 2013; 24121792). Loss of heterozygosity of TSC1 has been observed in up to 54% of bladder urothelial carcinomas (Guo et al., 2013; 23401075, Adachi et al., 2003; 12853839, Knowles et al., 2003; 14633685). Low expression of Hamartin has been associated with an increased risk of progression in bladder urothelial carcinoma (Mhawech_Fauceglia et al., 2008; 18480009). Loss or inactivation of TSC1 can activate mTOR signaling (Tee et al., 2003; 12906785, Mallela et al., 2021; 33575875); however, response rates for patients with TSC1_mutated solid tumors treated with MTOR inhibitors such as everolimus and temsirolimus have been low (Adib et al., 2021; 33727259, Nassar et al., 2020; 31653662, Voss et al., 2019; 30327302). In the prospective NCI_MATCH study, the ORR for patients with various TSC1_mutated solid tumors treated with everolimus was 7.7% (1/13); the single response was reported for a patient with urothelial cancer (Adib et al., 2021; 33727259). In TSC1_mutated renal cell carcinoma (RCC), although responses to MTOR inhibitors have been described in multiple case series and reports (Ali et al., 2015; 25796537, Lim et al., 2016; 26859683, Kwiatkowski et al., 2016; 26831717, Hamieh et al., 2018; 30256787, Roldan_Romero et al., 2020; 31335987), retrospective analysis of a broader cohort showed no responses in TSC1_mutated RCC (0/7) (Nassar et al., 2020; 31653662). Retrospective analyses of the RECORD_3, GRANITE_1, and EVOLVE_1 studies of everolimus to treat patients with RCC, gastric cancer, or hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively, showed no significant association between alterations in MTOR, TSC1, or TSC2 and median PFS (Voss et al., 2019; 30327302). PRs have been reported for patients with TSC1_altered perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (Wagner et al., 2021; 34637337, Kopparthy and Murphy, 2021; 34123648) and epithelial ovarian carcinoma (Dickson et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3111) treated with nab_sirolimus. One or more of the TSC1 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (ClinVar, Sep 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Inactivating germline mutations in TSC1 are associated with the autosomal dominant disorder tuberous sclerosis complex, which results in the development of hamartomas in multiple organ systems and an increased risk of developing renal cell carcinoma (Gomez, 1991; 2039135, van Slegtenhorst et al., 1997; 9242607). TSC1 mutations account for approximately 10 to 30% of reported sporadic cases (Crino et al., 2006; 17005952). Prevalence for this disorder in the general population is estimated to be 1/6,000 from birth and 1/12,000 to 1/14,000 in children under 10 years of age (Curatolo et al., 2008; 18722871).

TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB level that may be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors in urothelial carcinoma (Galsky et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 848PD, Necchi et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT003, Rosenberg et al., 2016; 26952546, Balar et al., 2017; 27939400, Powles et al., 2018; 29268948, Mariathasan et al., 2018; 29443960, Miao et al., 2018; 30150660, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Sarid et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 938, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526). In the Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma TCGA dataset, the median somatic mutation burden was 5.5 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014; 24476821). One study reported that the number of somatic mutations positively correlates with increased tumor stage and grade of bladder cancers (Cazier et al., 2016; 24777035). For patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma receiving atezolizumab, however, higher median mutation load has been reported to be significantly associated with improved PFS and OS (Rosenberg et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 104)(Rosenberg et al., 2016; 26952546, Balar et al., 2017; 27939400). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors in urothelial carcinoma, higher TMB has corresponded with clinical benefit from treatment with anti_PD_L1 (Rosenberg et al., 2016; 26952546, Balar et al., 2017; 27939400, Powles et al., 2018; 29268948, Mariathasan et al., 2018; 29443960, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Miao et al., 2018; 30150660) and anti_PD_1 immunotherapeutic agents (Galsky et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 848PD, Necchi et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT003). For patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma treated with the PD_L1 inhibitor atezolizumab, those with a significantly increased mutational load (9.7 Muts/Mb or greater by this assay or others) were associated with response and longer OS compared with those with lower TMB (Rosenberg et al., 2016; 26952546, Powles et al., 2018; 29268948, Balar et al., 2017; 27939400, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254). Similarly, in a study of pembrolizumab in muscle invasive bladder cancer, the median TMB in responders was 12.3 Muts/Mb, versus 7.0 Muts/Mb in nonresponding patients (Necchi et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT003). The PD_1 inhibitor nivolumab led to increased ORR, PFS, and OS for patients with a TMB of 167 missense mutations/tumor or higher (~ equivalency = 9 Muts/Mb or higher as measured by this assay) compared with those harboring lower TMB in a study of metastatic urothelial cancer (Galsky et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 848PD).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Increased tumor mutational burden may predict response to anti_PD_1 (alone or in combination with anti_CTLA_4) or anti_PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Avelumab", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Avelumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to PD_L1 and blocks its interaction with PD_1 in order to enhance antitumor immune responses.

As second_line therapy for advanced urothelial carcinoma in the Phase 3 IMvigor211 study, atezolizumab compared with chemotherapy did not significantly improve median OS (11.1 vs. 10.6 months, HR=0.87) for patients with PD_L1 expression on 5% or more of tumor_infiltrating immune cells (Powles et al., 2018; 29268948). The ORRs (23% vs. 22%) and median PFSs (HR=1.01) were similar between the treatment arms, but atezolizumab was associated with a numerically longer median duration of response (15.9 vs. 8.3 months) (Powles et al., 2018; 29268948) The Phase 3 IMvigor130 study for patients with treatment_naive urothelial carcinoma found that the addition of atezolizumab to platinum_based chemotherapy improved median PFS (8.2 vs. 6.3 months, HR=0.82) and numerically improved median OS (16.0 vs. 13.4 months, HR=0.83) compared to placebo, with similar ORRs (47.4% vs. 43.8%) but a higher CR rate (12.5% vs. 6.8%)(Galsky et al., 2020; 32416780). In a Phase 2 study, patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma treated with atezolizumab as first_line therapy experienced an ORR of 23%, a CR rate of 9%, and a clinical benefit rate of 30% (Balar et al., 2017; 27939400). Another Phase 2 trial of atezolizumab as second_line therapy reported an ORR of 15%, with 80% (37/46) of the responses ongoing at the median follow_up of 14.4 months; the median PFS was 2.11 months, and the 12_month OS rate was 37% (Dreicer et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 4515, Rosenberg et al., 2016; 26952546).

Both p15INK4b and p16INK4a bind to and inhibit CDK4 and CDK6, thereby maintaining the growth_suppressive activity of the Rb tumor suppressor; loss or inactivation of either p15INK4b or p16INK4a contributes to dysregulation of the CDK4/6_cyclin_Rb pathway and loss of cell cycle control (Gazzeri et al., 1998; 9484839, Roussel, 1999; 10498883). The tumor suppressive functions of p14ARF involve stabilization and activation of p53, via a mechanism of MDM2 inhibition (Sherr et al., 2005; 16869746, Ozenne et al., 2010; 20549699). One or more alterations observed here are predicted to result in p16INK4a loss of function (Ruas et al., 1999; 10498896, Jones et al., 2007; 17909018, Haferkamp et al., 2008; 18843795, Huot et al., 2002; 12417717, Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Gombart et al., 1997; 9324288, Yang et al., 1995; 7780957, Parry and Peters, 1996; 8668202, Greenblatt et al., 2003; 12606942, Yarbrough et al., 1999; 10491434, Poi et al., 2001; 11255261, Byeon et al., 1998; 9660926, Kannengiesser et al., 2009; 19260062, Lal et al., 2000; 10719365, Koh et al., 1995; 7777061, McKenzie et al., 2010; 20340136, Miller et al., 2011; 21462282, Arap et al., 1997; 905385, Scaini et al., 2014; 24659262, Jenkins et al., 2013; 23190892, Walker et al., 1999; 10389768, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). One or more alterations seen here are predicted to result in p14ARF loss of function (Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Itahana and Zhang, 2008; 18538737, Zhang and Xiong, 1999; 10360174, Zhang et al., 1998; 9529249, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). CDKN2B alterations such as seen here are predicted to inactivate p15INK4b (Jafri et al., 2015; 25873077). In the Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma TCGA dataset, concurrent homozygous deletion of CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been reported in 35% of cases, and CDKN2A mutation has been found in 5.5% of cases (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 24476821). Loss of CDKN2A/B or loss of p14ARF, p16INK4a, or p15INK4b protein expression occurs frequently in bladder urothelial carcinoma, with reports of frequency ranging from 18% to 77% (Lee et al., 2010; 20890425, Bartoletti et al., 2007; 17612565, Eissa et al., 2004; 15590562, Korkolopoulou et al., 2001; 11223676, Le et al., 2001; 11720438, Ross et al., 2014; 23887298, Yurakh et al., 2006; 16624482, Le et al., 2004; 15257544, Orlow et al., 1995; 7563186). Several studies have associated loss of CDKN2A/B or loss of p16INK4a and p15INK4b expression with disease progression, decreased recurrence_free disease, and poor prognosis in patients with urothelial carcinoma, although results have been inconsistent (Kim et al., 2014; 25092538, Pollard et al., 2010; 20334706, Lee et al., 2010; 20890425, Yin et al., 2008; 18234280, Bartoletti et al., 2007; 17612565, Rebouissou et al., 2012; 22422578, Yurakh et al., 2006; 16624482, Korkolopoulou et al., 2001; 11223676). Preclinical data suggest that tumors with loss of p16INK4a function may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, ribociclib, and palbociclib (Konecny et al., 2011; 21278246, Katsumi et al., 2011; 21871868, Cen et al., 2012; 22711607, Logan et al., 2013; 23898052). Although case studies have reported that patients with breast cancer or uterine leiomyosarcoma harboring CDKN2A loss responded to palbociclib treatment (Elvin et al., 2017; 28283584, Gao et al., 2015; 26715889), multiple other clinical studies have shown no significant correlation between p16INK4a loss or inactivation and therapeutic benefit of these agents (Gopalan et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8077, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Konecny et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5557)(DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Johnson et al., 2014; 24797823); it is not known whether CDK4/6 inhibitors would be beneficial in this case. Although preclinical studies have suggested that loss of p14ARF function may be associated with reduced sensitivity to MDM2 inhibitors (Van Maerken et al., 2011; 21460101, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357), the clinical relevance of p14ARF as a predictive biomarker is not clear. There are no drugs that directly target the mutation or loss of CDKN2B in cancer. Because the p15INK4b protein encoded by CDKN2B is known to inhibit CDK4, tumors with CDKN2B mutation or loss may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as ribociclib, abemaciclib, and palbociclib (Infante et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 2528, Shapiro et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 2500)(Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126). Germline CDKN2A mutation is associated with melanoma_pancreatic cancer syndrome, a condition marked by increased risk of developing malignant melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer (Whelan et al., 1995; 7666917). Mutation carriers within families may develop either or both types of cancer, and melanoma cases may be referred to as familial or hereditary melanoma (Hansson, 2010; 20687502, Hogg et al., 1998; 9479083). CDKN2A is the most implicated gene in familial melanoma, with germline mutations present in 16% to 20% of familial melanoma cases (De Unamuno et al., 2018; 29543703, Soura et al., 2016; 26892650, Huerta et al., 2018; 29405243). CDKN2A alteration has also been implicated in familial melanoma_astrocytoma syndrome, an extremely rare tumor association characterized by dual predisposition to melanoma and nervous system tumors (Kaufman et al., 1993; 8414022, Bahuau et al., 1998; 9622062, Chan et al., 2017; 28699883). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of CDKN2A is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}, {"Name": "CDKN2B loss", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "CDKN2B loss"}}, "Interpretation": "CDKN2A encodes two different, unrelated tumor suppressor proteins, p16INK4a and p14ARF, whereas CDKN2B encodes the tumor suppressor p15INK4b (Quelle et al., 1995; 8521522, Sharpless, 2005; 15878778). Both p15INK4b and p16INK4a bind to and inhibit CDK4 and CDK6, thereby maintaining the growth_suppressive activity of the Rb tumor suppressor; loss or inactivation of either p15INK4b or p16INK4a contributes to dysregulation of the CDK4/6_cyclin_Rb pathway and loss of cell cycle control (Gazzeri et al., 1998; 9484839, Roussel, 1999; 10498883). The tumor suppressive functions of p14ARF involve stabilization and activation of p53, via a mechanism of MDM2 inhibition (Sherr et al., 2005; 16869746, Ozenne et al., 2010; 20549699). One or more alterations observed here are predicted to result in p16INK4a loss of function (Ruas et al., 1999; 10498896, Jones et al., 2007; 17909018, Haferkamp et al., 2008; 18843795, Huot et al., 2002; 12417717, Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Gombart et al., 1997; 9324288, Yang et al., 1995; 7780957, Parry and Peters, 1996; 8668202, Greenblatt et al., 2003; 12606942, Yarbrough et al., 1999; 10491434, Poi et al., 2001; 11255261, Byeon et al., 1998; 9660926, Kannengiesser et al., 2009; 19260062, Lal et al., 2000; 10719365, Koh et al., 1995; 7777061, McKenzie et al., 2010; 20340136, Miller et al., 2011; 21462282, Arap et al., 1997; 905385, Scaini et al., 2014; 24659262, Jenkins et al., 2013; 23190892, Walker et al., 1999; 10389768, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). One or more alterations seen here are predicted to result in p14ARF loss of function (Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Itahana and Zhang, 2008; 18538737, Zhang and Xiong, 1999; 10360174, Zhang et al., 1998; 9529249, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). CDKN2B alterations such as seen here are predicted to inactivate p15INK4b (Jafri et al., 2015; 25873077). In the Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma TCGA dataset, concurrent homozygous deletion of CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been reported in 35% of cases, and CDKN2A mutation has been found in 5.5% of cases (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 24476821). Loss of CDKN2A/B or loss of p14ARF, p16INK4a, or p15INK4b protein expression occurs frequently in bladder urothelial carcinoma, with reports of frequency ranging from 18% to 77% (Lee et al., 2010; 20890425, Bartoletti et al., 2007; 17612565, Eissa et al., 2004; 15590562, Korkolopoulou et al., 2001; 11223676, Le et al., 2001; 11720438, Ross et al., 2014; 23887298, Yurakh et al., 2006; 16624482, Le et al., 2004; 15257544, Orlow et al., 1995; 7563186). Several studies have associated loss of CDKN2A/B or loss of p16INK4a and p15INK4b expression with disease progression, decreased recurrence_free disease, and poor prognosis in patients with urothelial carcinoma, although results have been inconsistent (Kim et al., 2014; 25092538, Pollard et al., 2010; 20334706, Lee et al., 2010; 20890425, Yin et al., 2008; 18234280, Bartoletti et al., 2007; 17612565, Rebouissou et al., 2012; 22422578, Yurakh et al., 2006; 16624482, Korkolopoulou et al., 2001; 11223676). Preclinical data suggest that tumors with loss of p16INK4a function may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, ribociclib, and palbociclib (Konecny et al., 2011; 21278246, Katsumi et al., 2011; 21871868, Cen et al., 2012; 22711607, Logan et al., 2013; 23898052). Although case studies have reported that patients with breast cancer or uterine leiomyosarcoma harboring CDKN2A loss responded to palbociclib treatment (Elvin et al., 2017; 28283584, Gao et al., 2015; 26715889), multiple other clinical studies have shown no significant correlation between p16INK4a loss or inactivation and therapeutic benefit of these agents (Gopalan et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8077, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Konecny et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5557)(DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Johnson et al., 2014; 24797823); it is not known whether CDK4/6 inhibitors would be beneficial in this case. Although preclinical studies have suggested that loss of p14ARF function may be associated with reduced sensitivity to MDM2 inhibitors (Van Maerken et al., 2011; 21460101, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357), the clinical relevance of p14ARF as a predictive biomarker is not clear. There are no drugs that directly target the mutation or loss of CDKN2B in cancer. Because the p15INK4b protein encoded by CDKN2B is known to inhibit CDK4, tumors with CDKN2B mutation or loss may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as ribociclib, abemaciclib, and palbociclib (Infante et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 2528, Shapiro et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 2500)(Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126). Germline CDKN2A mutation is associated with melanoma_pancreatic cancer syndrome, a condition marked by increased risk of developing malignant melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer (Whelan et al., 1995; 7666917). Mutation carriers within families may develop either or both types of cancer, and melanoma cases may be referred to as familial or hereditary melanoma (Hansson, 2010; 20687502, Hogg et al., 1998; 9479083). CDKN2A is the most implicated gene in familial melanoma, with germline mutations present in 16% to 20% of familial melanoma cases (De Unamuno et al., 2018; 29543703, Soura et al., 2016; 26892650, Huerta et al., 2018; 29405243).

A significant number of inactivating KDM6A mutations have been found across multiple tumor types, suggesting a role as a tumor suppressor (van Haaften et al., 2009; 19330029). KDM6A mutations have been reported in 3.9% of samples analyzed, with the highest incidence in tumors of the urinary tract (31%), liver (7.3%), endometrium (6.7%), salivary gland (6.0%), and pancreas (5.1%) (COSMIC, Jan 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). KDM6A mutations or copy number alterations have also been identified in medulloblastoma (8.9%)(Robinson et al., 2012; 22722829), adenoid cystic carcinoma (6.7%) (Ho et al., 2013; 23685749), and metastatic prostate cancer (10%) (Grasso et al., 2012; 22722839). KDM6A inactivation has been found as a recurrent tumorigenic event in male T_cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T_ALL), and loss of KDM6A increased the sensitivity of T_ALL cells to therapies targeting histone H3 lysine 27 methylation in preclinical assays (Van der Meulen et al., 2014; 25320243). However, KDM6A overexpression has been noted in breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma, and correlated with inferior prognosis in patients with breast cancer (Wang et al., 2013; 23792809, Kim et al., 2014; 24491801, Shen et al., 2012; 23057811).

LYN is expressed predominantly in hematopoietic cells and conveys signals from the B_cell receptor (BCR) and other receptors to activate the PI3K, STAT, and other signaling pathways (reviewed in Xu et al., 2005; 15664155, Ingley, 2012; 22805580). LYN alterations are rare in solid tumors (cBio_Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359, cBio_Nguyen et al., 2022; 35120664). However, LYN amplification has been reported more frequently, including in ovarian (3.1%), melanoma (2.3%), prostate (2.2%), breast (1.9%), and endometrial (1.6%) cancers (cBio_Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359, cBio_Nguyen et al., 2022; 35120664). LYN expression and activation have also been reported in several types of solid tumors, including glioblastoma (Stettner et al., 2005; 15994925), prostate cancer (Goldenberg_Furmanov et al., 2004; 14871838), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)(Wheeler et al., 2012; 22490227), Ewing sarcoma (Guan et al., 2008; 18644993), and breast cancer (Choi et al., 2010; 20215510). High LYN expression was associated with lower survival rates for patients with breast, colorectal, and renal cancers (Choi et al., 2010; 20215510, Huang et al., 2013; 23764002, Su et al. 2012; 22731636, Roseweir et al., 2016; 26984511). Dasatinib is a kinase inhibitor that targets the BCR_ABL fusion protein, SRC family kinases including LYN (specifically at low nanomolar concentration)(Nam et al., 2005; 16230377, Williams et al., 2009; 18984583), and other kinases, and has been approved to treat chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A pediatric patient with relapsed B_cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and an NCOR1_LYN fusion achieved complete remission after 2 weeks of treatment with dasatinib (Dai et al., 2020; 32266142). Similarly, a preclinical study showed that treatment with dasatinib significantly increased survival in a xenograft model of leukemic blast cells harboring NCOR1_LYN (Tomii et al., 2021; 33199837). In preclinical studies of LYN_expressing breast and prostate cancer, dasatinib has been reported to inhibit cell migration and invasion (Choi et al., 2010; 20215510, Nam et al., 2005; 16230377).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI has been detected in 26_49% of urothelial carcinomas (Mylona et al., 2008; 18254781, Amira et al., 2003; 14501713); MSI_H has also been reported in multiple case studies of upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (Bai et al., 2013; 23690119). MSI, as determined through loss of MSH2 or MSH6 protein expression, correlated with non_invasive, well_differentiated bladder tumors and favorable overall survival (Mylona et al., 2008; 18254781). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TERT", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "promoter _124C>T", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "promoter _124C>T"}}, "Interpretation": "Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT, or hTERT) is a catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex, which is required to maintain appropriate chromosomal length (Shay et al., 2011; 22015685).

Mutations within the promoter region of TERT that confer enhanced TERT promoter activity have been reported in two hotspots, located at _124 bp and _146 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (also termed C228T and C250T, respectively)(Horn et al., 2013; 23348503, Huang et al., 2014; 23348506, Vinagre et al., 2013; 23887589), as well as tandem mutations at positions \u2013124/\u2013125 bp and \u2013138/\u2013139 bp (Horn et al., 2013; 23348503).

One study reported TERT promoter mutations in 67% (14/21) of high_grade and 56% (34/61) of low_grade bladder carcinomas (Vinagre et al., 2013; 23887589), while another study demonstrated that 85% (44/52) of all bladder cancer samples and 88% (7/8) of bladder cancer cell lines exhibited TERT promoter alteration (Liu et al., 2013; 23603989). TERT promoter mutations correlated with increased TERT mRNA expression in urothelial cancer cells (Borah et al., 2015; 25722414). In patients with bladder urothelial carcinoma, both TERT promoter mutations and increased TERT expression associate with poor prognosis, although carrying an additional germline alteration at _245 (rs2853669) may confer a better prognosis (Kinde et al., 2013; 24121487, Rachakonda et al., 2013; 24101484, Borah et al., 2015; 25722414). Therapeutic options for targeting tumors with TERT mutations are limited, although a variety of approaches have been investigated, including immunotherapies using TERT as a tumor_associated antigen and antisense oligonucleotide_ or peptide_based therapies. TERT peptide vaccines showed limited anticancer efficacy in clinical trials (Zanetti et al., 2017; 27245281); however, in one preclinical study, the combination of a TERT peptide vaccine and anti_CTLA_4 therapy suppressed tumor growth (Duperret at al., 2018; 29249395).
