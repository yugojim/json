Loss of functional ATM promotes tumorigenesis (Cremona and Behrens, 2014; 23851492). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt ATM function or expression (Jiang et al., 2006; 16603769, Fernandes et al., 2005; 15713674, Scott et al., 2002; 11805335). ATM mutations have been reported in 2_6% of prostate tumors, including in 2% of localized prostate cancers and in 6% of metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancers (Fraser et al., 2017; 28068672, Robinson et al., 2015; 26000489, Tukachinsky 2021; 33558422, Abida et al., 2019; 31061129). In advanced prostate cancer tissue samples, ATM deep deletion has been observed in 0_2% of cases (Robinson et al., 2015; 26000489, Abida et al., 2019; 31061129, Stopsack et al., 2020; 32220891). ATM mutations have been detected in liquid biopsies for 3_9% of patients with metastatic prostate cancer and circulating tumor DNA (Warner et al., 2021; 33414135, Tukachinsky 2021; 33558422) and may be more frequent in liquid compared to tissue biopsies (Tukachinsky 2021; 33558422). An exome sequencing study of aggressive and non_aggressive prostate cancer cases reported that patients with pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or deleterious ATM mutations had statistically higher odds of aggressive disease (2.2_fold), death due to prostate cancer (2.2_fold), and metastatic disease (3.0_fold)(Darst et al., 2022; AACR Abstract 688); however, ATM mutations in liquid or tissue biopsies of metastatic prostate cancer had no prognostic impact in two large retrospective studies (Warner et al., 2021; 33414135, Abida et al., 2019; 31061129). ATM mutations also did not correlate with time on treatment with first_line abiraterone or enzalutamide for patients with metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer (Abida et al., 2019; 31061129). Loss of functional ATM results in a defective DNA damage response and homologous recombination_mediated DNA repair and may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Michels et al., 2014; 24037533, Bryant and Helleday, 2006; 16556909). Clinical responses have been reported for patients with ATM_mutated prostate cancer treated with PARP inhibitors (Mateo et al., 2015; 26510020, Mateo et al., 2020; 31806540, de Bono et al., 2020; ASCO GU Abstract 119, Abida et al., 2020; 32086346) and PARP inhibitors have shown limited clinical benefit for patients with other ATM_mutated solid tumors including pancreatic cancer (Ma et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 563, Dhawan et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 3513), colorectal cancer (Ma et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 563, Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006, Papageorgiou et al., 2021; 35004311), papillary renal cell carcinoma (Olson et al., 2016; 27079472), ovarian cancer (Swisher et al., 2021; 33941784), small cell bowel cancer, (Dhawan et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 3513), and biliary tract cancer (Piha_Paul et al., 2018; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract A096, Zhang et al., 2020; 32045060). The Phase 3 PROfound study for patients with metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) who had progressed on a new hormonal agent reported improved radiographic PFS with olaparib compared with physician s choice of abiraterone/prednisone or enzalutamide for patients with BRCA1/2 or ATM alterations (7.4 vs. 3.6 mo., HR=0.34) (Hussain et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA12PR). In Phase 1 trials of ATR inhibitors, a heavily pretreated patient with colorectal cancer who achieved a CR to berzosertib (O Carrigan et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2504) and 4 out of 4 patients with diverse solid tumors who achieved PRs to BAY1895344 (Yap et al., 2020; 32988960) harbored ATM inactivation or protein loss; studies showing reduced cell viability and increased DNA damage in preclinical models of solid tumors (Menezes et al., 2015; 25232030, Vendetti et al., 2015; 26517239, Min et al., 2017; 28138034) and hematologic malignancies (Menezes et al., 2015; 25232030, Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132) also support the increased sensitivity of ATM_deficient cells to ATR inhibitors. Preclinical experiments also indicate that loss of ATM causes dependency on DNA_PKcs in cancer cells; DNA_PKcs inhibitors promoted apoptosis in ATM_deficient cells and were active in a lymphoma mouse model lacking ATM activity (Riabinska et al., 2013; 23761041). Alterations in DNA repair genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, FANCA, RAD51D, CHEK2, and CDK12 have been reported to be predictive for sensitivity to platinum agents in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (NCCN Prostate Cancer Guidelines, v3.2022) (Cheng et al., 2015; 26724258, Imyanitov et al., 2011; 21819606, Mota et al., 2020; 32856010, Pomerantz et al., 2017; 28608931). Clinical data from small retrospective studies (Vlachostergios et al., 2019; AACR Abstract 4865, Priv\u00e9 et al., 2021; 34253846) and case reports (Crumbaker et al., 2019; 35100671, Satapathy et al., 2021; 33630794, Kratochwil et al., 2020; 31601699, Ahmadzadehfar et al., 2018; 29762244, De Giorgi et al., 2021; 34333554) are conflicting as to whether alterations in DNA repair genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATM are associated with outcomes for patients with CRPC treated with PSMA_targeted radionuclide_based therapies such as lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan (177Lu_PSMA_617). ATM mutation carriers have increased cancer risk, with female carriers displaying a 38% lifetime risk of breast cancer (van Os et al., 2016; 26662178). Biallelic mutations in ATM underlie the rare autosomal_recessive inherited disorder ataxia_telangiectasia (A_T), also referred to as genome instability or DNA damage response syndrome (Rothblum_Oviatt et al., 2016; 27884168). This disease is characterized by genomic instability, sensitivity to DNA_damaging agents, and increased risk of developing cancer (Shiloh and Ziv, 2013; 23847781, Rothblum_Oviatt et al., 2016; 27884168). The prevalence of A_T is estimated at 1:40,000 to 1:100,000 worldwide (Rothblum_Oviatt et al., 2016; 27884168). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of ATM is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors may detect nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Loss or inactivation of ATM may increase sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, ATR inhibitors, or DNA_PKcs inhibitors.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Rucaparib", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> The PARP inhibitor rucaparib is FDA approved to treat patients with metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) or epithelial ovarian, Fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer and deleterious somatic or germline BRCA mutations.

The effects of hypermutation on prognosis and clinical features in prostate cancer have not been extensively investigated (PubMed, Feb 2022).

In NSCLC, multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 to 16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). In HNSCC, a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "DNMT3A", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Q842*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Q842*"}}, "Interpretation": "The DNMT3A gene encodes the protein DNA methyltransferase 3A, an enzyme that is involved in the methylation of newly synthesized DNA, a function critical for gene regulation (Trowbridge and Orkin, 2012; 22200773, Ch\u00e9din, 2011; 21507354). The role of DNMT3A in cancer is uncertain, as some reports describe increased expression and contribution to tumor growth, whereas others propose a role for DNMT3A as a tumor suppressor (Yang et al., 2011; 21887466, Vallb\u00f6hmer et al., 2006; 16870044, Daskalos et al., 2011; 21351083, Fabbri et al., 2007; 17890317, Gao et al., 2011; 22011581, Kim et al., 2013; 23031157). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt DNMT3A function or expression (Chen et al., 2005; 15861382, Guo et al., 2015; 25383530, Sandoval et al., 2019; 30705090, Zhang et al., 2018; 29414941). DNMT3A alterations have been reported at relatively low frequencies in solid tumors and are more prevalent in hematological malignancies (cBioPortal, Feb 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of DNMT3A alterations in solid tumors are limited (PubMed, Feb 2022). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in DNMT3A in solid tumors. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Cannot Be Determined", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Cannot Be Determined"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI has been reported in 3.1_14.6% of prostate cancer samples (Hall et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 1523, Cheng et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 251)(Pritchard et al., 2014; 25255306, Schwarzenbach et al., 2008; 18336598, Suzuki et al., 1995; 7493915). A study of prostate cancer in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) families reported MSI_H in 4_50% of cases (Dominguez_Valentin et al., 2016; 27013479, Rosty et al., 2014; 25117503, Ahman et al., 2001; 11251526). For patients with advanced prostate cancer, dMMR/MSI status was associated with shorter median OS compared with patients with proficient MMR (3.8 vs. 7.0 years) by univariate and multivariate analysis (adjusted HR=4.09; P=0.005)(Rodrigues et al., 2018; 30382943). On the basis of prospective clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD_1_targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143) and PD_L1_targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92).

Upon binding of membrane_bound ligands, NOTCH signaling involves cleavage of the NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD), which subsequently forms part of a transcription factor complex that regulates downstream target genes (Penton et al., 2012; 22306179, Kopan and Ilagan, 2009; 19379690). Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. NOTCH3 mutations have been reported in up to 2% of metastatic prostate cancers (cBio_Grasso et al., 2012; 22722839, cBio_Robinson et al., 2015; 26000489) but not in two other studies of prostate adenocarcinoma (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26544944, cBio_Barbieri et al., 2012; 22610119). NOTCH3 amplification or overexpression has been associated with poor clinicopathological features in prostate carcinoma, although the role of NOTCH signaling in this disease is complex (Carvalho et al., 2014; 24737393, Kim et al., 2019; 31934201). Several approaches for inhibiting NOTCH3 signaling are being developed, including neutralizing NOTCH antibodies such as tarextumab (OMP_59R5) (Yen et al., 2015; 25934888), which targets NOTCH2 and NOTCH3, and pan_NOTCH inhibitors, such as gamma_secretase inhibitors (GSI) (Hu et al., 2014; 24743243, Konishi et al., 2007; 17804716, Xiao et al., 2011; 20838375). In a Phase 2 study, the GSI AL101 (BMS_906024) elicited PR in 15% (6/39) and SD in 54% (21/39) of patients with metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma harboring NOTCH activating alterations (Ferrarotto et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 919MO). Phase 2 studies have evaluated the efficacy of tarextumab in combination with chemotherapy in metastatic pancreatic cancer or extensive_stage small cell lung cancer, though NOTCH3 expression was not found to be a predictor of OS or PFS in either study (Hu et al., 2019; 31347292; O\u2019Reilly et al., 2015; Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium Abstract 278, Daniel et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 1530PD).

PTPN11 plays a critical role in both embryonic development and cancer (Grossmann et al., 2010; 20399956). PTPN11 is also known to be somatically mutated in a variety of cancers, where both oncogenic and tumor suppressor roles for PTPN11 have been described (Tartaglia et al., 2003; 12717436, Bard_Chapeau et al., 2011; 21575863, Sturla et al., 2011; 21934682). Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. PTPN11 mutations have been reported in <2% of prostate carcinoma cases (cBio_Taylor et al., 2010; 20579941, cBio_Abida et al., 2019; 31061129). A lower ratio of positive SHP_2 expression, measured by IHC, in tissue samples from patients with prostate cancer was associated with shorter time to biochemical recurrence (BCR) (Tassidis et al., 2013; 23192641). SHP_2 has been reported to activate the RAS_MEK_ERK, PI3K_AKT_mTOR, and SRC kinase pathways (Liu et al., 2011; 21393858, Feng et al., 2012; 21996738, Wang et al., 2009; 19008228, Zhou and Agazie, 2008; 18421299). Based on a case study of a patient with histiocytic sarcoma harboring an activating PTPN11 mutation who experienced a PR to trametinib (Voruz et al., 2018; 29097496), as well as preclinical data (Tasian et al., 2019; 29884903, Krenz et al., 2005; 16166557, Nakamura et al., 2009; 19706403), PTPN11 activation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors in histiocytic neoplasms. It is not known whether these therapeutic approaches would be relevant in the context of alterations that have not been fully characterized, as seen here. Germline mutations in PTPN11 have been found in the developmental disorder Noonan syndrome, which predisposes individuals to various cancers, including embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (Brasil et al., 2010; 20578946, Hasle, 2009; 20029231, Chen et al., 2006; 16518851, Tartaglia et al., 2006; 16358218, Pierpont et al., 2009; 19077116, Mathur et al., 2014; 24754368).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Fraction", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction Not Detected", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction Not Detected"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor fraction provides an estimate of the percentage of ctDNA present in a cell_free DNA (cfDNA) sample. The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with elevated tumor fraction values have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus high sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at low risk of false negative results. However, if elevated tumor fraction is not detected, it does not exclude the presence of disease burden or compromise the confidence of reported alterations. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels. In the research setting, changes in tumor fraction estimates have been associated with treatment duration and clinical response and may be a useful indicator for future cancer management (Bronkhorst
