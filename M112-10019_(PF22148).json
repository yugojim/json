Amplification of CCND1 has been positively correlated with cyclin D1 overexpression (Elsheikh et al., 2008; 17653856) and may lead to excessive proliferation (Fu et al., 2004; 15331580, Takahashi_Yanaga and Sasaguri, 2008; 18023328). CCND1 amplification has been reported in 12_15% of bladder urothelial carcinomas (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 24476821, Ross et al., 2013; 23887298, Zaharieva et al., 2003; 14648664). The expression of cyclin D1, as detected by immunohistochemistry, has been reported in 64_83% of urothelial carcinomas (Takagi et al., 2000; 11144504, Tut et al., 2001; 11161387, Dolicanin et al., 2011; 21899177, Lee et al., 1999; 10504527, Lee et al., 1998; 9614448). The evidence linking CCND1 amplification and expression with prognosis in patients with urothelial carcinoma is mixed (Takagi et al., 2000; 11144504, Tut et al., 2001; 11161387, Fristrup et al., 2013; 23201130, Seiler et al., 2013; 23887292, Olsson et al., 2012; 23304558, Zaharieva et al., 2003; 14648664, Osman et al., 1997; 9815621). CCND1 amplification was associated with tumor progression and worse patient survival in patients with bladder cancer (Zaharieva et al., 2003; 14648664). In another study involving patients with surgically treated lymph node_positive bladder urothelial carcinoma, CCND1 amplification correlated with shorter survival, although high nuclear cyclin D1 in metastases predicted a favorable response to adjuvant chemotherapy (Seiler et al., 2013; 23887292). Cyclin D1 expression was reported to be higher in lower stage urothelial tumors and increased expression in advanced tumors was associated with improved survival (Takagi et al., 2000; 11144504, Tut et al., 2001; 11161387). Similarly, a study of non_muscle_invasive bladder cancer correlated high cyclin D1 expression with increased PFS (Fristrup et al., 2013; 23201130). However, in patients with bilharzial_related bladder cancer, cyclin D1 expression was associated with invasion and higher tumor grade (Osman et al., 1997; 9815621). Another study reported no significant association of CCND1 protein expression and prognosis in patients with urothelial carcinoma (Olsson et al., 2012; 23304558). Amplification or overexpression of CCND1 may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib (Juric et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 568, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Tolaney et al., 2016; SABCS P4_22_12, Morschhauser et al., 2020; 32381571, Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27217383, Leonard et al., 2012; 22383795), although as monotherapy these agents have shown limited activity in tumor types other than breast cancer (Dickler et al., 2017; 28533223, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27217383). In refractory advanced solid tumors with CCND1 (n=39) or CCND3 (n=1) amplification and retinoblastoma protein expression, palbociclib resulted in SD for 39% (14/36) of patients and a median PFS of 1.8 months in the NCI_MATCH trial (Clark et al., 2019; AACR Abstract LB_010/2); 4 patients (13%, 4/36 overall) with squamous cell carcinomas (lung, esophageal, or laryngeal) or adenoid cystic carcinoma experienced prolonged SD in this study (Clark et al., 2019; AACR Abstract LB_010/2). Among 9 patients with CCND1_amplified advanced solid tumors, 1 patient with bladder cancer responded to ribociclib in a Phase 2 trial (Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528). CCND1 amplification may predict worse outcomes on immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti_PD_1/PD_L1/CTLA_4) in solid tumors on the basis of 2 meta_analyses (Chen et al., 2020; 32903763, Litchfield et al., 2021; 33508232); in these studies, CCND1 amplification was associated with significantly decreased response rate (Litchfield et al., 2021; 33508232) and OS (HR=1.6_2.0)(Chen et al., 2020; 32903763, Litchfield et al., 2021; 33508232) across various tumor types and significantly shorter OS specifically in urothelial carcinoma (HR=2.2_3.6), melanoma (HR=1.6_2.5), and solid tumors harboring elevated TMB (HR=2.8)(Chen et al., 2020; 32903763, Litchfield et al., 2021; 33508232).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "CCND1 amplification or overexpression may activate CDK4/6 and may predict sensitivity to single_agent CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04282031", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03297606", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05252416", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02896335", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "12", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "12"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB level that may be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors in urothelial carcinoma (Galsky et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 848PD, Necchi et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT003, Rosenberg et al., 2016; 26952546, Balar et al., 2017; 27939400, Powles et al., 2018; 29268948, Mariathasan et al., 2018; 29443960, Miao et al., 2018; 30150660, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Sarid et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 938, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526). In the Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma TCGA dataset, the median somatic mutation burden was 5.5 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014; 24476821). One study reported that the number of somatic mutations positively correlates with increased tumor stage and grade of bladder cancers (Cazier et al., 2016; 24777035). For patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma receiving atezolizumab, however, higher median mutation load has been reported to be significantly associated with improved PFS and OS (Rosenberg et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 104, Rosenberg et al., 2016; 26952546, Balar et al., 2017; 27939400). Another study for patients with urothelial bladder carcinoma showed that high tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with superior OS and disease_specific survival compared with low TMB; the OS benefit of high TMB was driven by the cohort with Stage 3 disease, whereas OS was similar between low and high TMB for patients with Stage 2 or Stage 4 disease (Voutsadakis, 2022; 35323317). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors in urothelial carcinoma, higher TMB has corresponded with clinical benefit from treatment with anti_PD_L1 (Rosenberg et al., 2016; 26952546, Balar et al., 2017; 27939400, Powles et al., 2018; 29268948, Mariathasan et al., 2018; 29443960, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Miao et al., 2018; 30150660) and anti_PD_1 immunotherapeutic agents (Galsky et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 848PD, Necchi et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT003). For patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma treated with the PD_L1 inhibitor atezolizumab, those with a significantly increased mutational load (9.7 Muts/Mb or greater by this assay or others) were associated with response and longer OS compared with those with lower TMB (Rosenberg et al., 2016; 26952546, Powles et al., 2018; 29268948, Balar et al., 2017; 27939400, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254). Similarly, in a study of pembrolizumab in muscle invasive bladder cancer, the median TMB in responders was 12.3 Muts/Mb, versus 7.0 Muts/Mb in nonresponding patients (Necchi et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT003). The PD_1 inhibitor nivolumab led to increased ORR, PFS, and OS for patients with a TMB of 167 missense mutations/tumor or higher (~ equivalency = 9 Muts/Mb or higher as measured by this assay) compared with those harboring lower TMB in a study of metastatic urothelial cancer (Galsky et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 848PD). CCND1 amplification may predict worse outcomes on immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti_PD_1/PD_L1/CTLA_4) in solid tumors on the basis of 2 meta_analyses (Chen et al., 2020; 32903763, Litchfield et al., 2021; 33508232); in these studies, CCND1 amplification was associated with significantly decreased response rate (Litchfield et al., 2021; 33508232) and OS (HR=1.6_2.0)(Chen et al., 2020; 32903763, Litchfield et al., 2021; 33508232) across various tumor types and significantly shorter OS specifically in urothelial carcinoma (HR=2.2_3.6), melanoma (HR=1.6_2.5), and solid tumors harboring elevated TMB (HR=2.8)(Chen et al., 2020; 32903763, Litchfield et al., 2021; 33508232).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Increased tumor mutational burden may predict response to anti_PD_1 (alone or in combination with anti_CTLA_4) or anti_PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Durvalumab", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Durvalumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to PD_L1 and blocks its interaction with PD_1 to enhance antitumor immune responses.

In the first_line setting for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, the randomized, controlled, Phase 3 DANUBE study showed that durvalumab monotherapy did not significantly improve median OS for patients with PD_L1 high tumor status compared with chemotherapy (14.4 vs. 12.1 months, HR=0.89, p=0.30); durvalumab plus tremelimumab also did not improve median OS in the intention_to_treat population (15.1 vs. 12.1 months, HR=0.85, p=0.075)(Powles et al., 2020; 32971005, Powles et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 697O). For chemotherapy_pretreated patients with advanced urinary tract carcinoma, the Phase 3b STRONG study of durvalumab reported an ORR of 18% and mOS of 7.0 months, with longer mOS observed for patients with high PD_L1 expression (9.3 vs. 6.5 months) (Sonpavde et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 429).

In a Phase 1 study of durvalumab with tremelimumab in a cohort of patients with platinum_refractory metastatic urothelial cancer, an ORR of 21% (35/168, 4 CRs), a median PFS of 1.9 months, and an OS of 9.5 months were reported (Balar et al., 2018; AACR abstract CT112).

The ORRs (23% vs. 22%) and median PFSs (mPFS) (HR=1.01) were similar between the treatment arms, but atezolizumab was associated with a numerically longer median duration of response (15.9 vs. 8.3 months) (Powles et al., 2018; 29268948). The 2_year OS rate was 23% with atezolizumab versus 13% with chemotherapy in an exploratory analysis of the overall trial population irrespective of PD_L1 status (van der Heijden et al., 2021; 33902955). The Phase 3 IMvigor130 study for patients with treatment_naive metastatic urothelial carcinoma found that the addition of atezolizumab to platinum_based chemotherapy improved mPFS (8.2 vs. 6.3 months, HR=0.82) and numerically improved mOS (16.0 vs. 13.4 months, HR=0.83) compared with placebo, with similar ORRs (47% vs. 44%) (Galsky et al., 2020; 32416780). A second interim analysis of mOS in the IMvigor130 trial showed a favorable trend for atezolizumab monotherapy compared with platinum_based chemotherapy (15.2 vs. 13.1 months, OS HR=0.99 ) but did not reach statistical significance, and exploratory analysis observed the greatest benefit for patients who were cisplatin_ineligible with tumor portion score (TPS) of \u22655% (OS HR=0.60) (Davis et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT040). In a Phase 2 study, patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma treated with atezolizumab as first_line therapy experienced an ORR of 23%, a CR rate of 8.9%, and a clinical benefit rate of 30% (Balar et al., 2017; 27939400). Multiple studies have reported superior ORR and OS outcomes with atezolizumab monotherapy for patients with higher tumor mutational burden (TMB) or PD_L1 expression compared with those with lower TMB or PD_L1 expression (Balar et al., 2017; 27939400, Powles et al., 2018; 29268948, Rosenberg et al., 2016; 26952546, Galsky et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 5011). A neoadjuvant trial for patients with muscle_invasive bladder cancer added atezolizumab to gemcitabine plus cisplatin and met its primary endpoint (non_muscle_invasive downstaging rate of 27/39) (Funt et al., 2022; 35089812). In the COSMIC_021 trial, patients with urothelial carcinoma (UC) post_platinum chemotherapy treated with the combination of atezolizumab with cabozantinib experienced an ORR of 27%, a DCR of 64%, and a median PFS (mPFS) of 5.4 months (n=30) (Pal et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 5013). The trial also reported benefit for patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC (mUC) receiving the combination in the first line, whether cisplatin_eligible (ORR: 30% [9/30]) or ineligible (ORR: 20% [6/30]) (Pal et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 4504).

A post_hoc analysis of pembrolizumab monotherapy efficacy in KEYNOTE_361 and KEYNOTE_052 reported that patients with a CR or PR response at 9 weeks of pembrolizumab therapy achieved better mOS outcomes (50.7 months) than patients with SD (17.5 months) or PD (5.3 months) as best response (Powles et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 519).

FGF19 lies in a region of chromosome 11q13 that also contains FGF3, FGF4, and CCND1; this region is frequently amplified in a diverse range of malignancies (Katoh et al., 2002; 12429977). Correlation between FGF19 amplification and protein expression has been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)(Kan et al., 2013; 23788652), lung squamous cell carcinoma (Li et al., 2020; 32111983, Caruso et al., 2019; 31063779), and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)(Gao et al., 2019; 30518874), but was not observed in other cancers (Sawey et al., 2011; 21397858, Kanzaki et al., 2021; 33674622).

A patient with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with 11q13 (FGF3, FGF4, FGF19) and 12p13 (FGF6 and FGF23) amplification experienced a CR lasting 9 months from a pan_FGFR inhibitor (Dumbrava et al., 2018; 31123723).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "FGF3", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "FGF3 encodes fibroblast growth factor 3, a growth factor that plays a central role in development of the inner ear.

HRAS has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210) and may be biologically relevant in this context (Zack et al., 2013; 24071852, Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). HRAS amplification has not been detected in published datasets of bladder and upper tract urothelial carcinoma (cBio_Sanchez_Vega et al., 2018; 29625050, Robinson et al., 2019; 31278255, Kim et al., 2020; 32332851). Activating HRAS mutations have been shown to play a role in the early development and progression of urothelial carcinomas (Pollard et al., 2010; 20334706, Zhang et al., 2001; 11360181, Mo et al., 2007; 17256055, Gao et al., 2004; 14737103). Among upper tract urothelial carcinomas, HRAS mutation was detected in 8 of 60 high_grade cases but not in any of the 23 low_grade cases (Sfakianos et al., 2015; 26278805). In one study, HRAS was reported to be a driving oncogene of the low_grade, non_invasive papillary subtype of urothelial carcinoma (Ahmad et al., 2012; 22422829). On the basis of significant clinical benefit for 1 patient each with cholangiocarcinoma (Nadauld et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e23162) and salivary gland carcinoma (Chintakuntlawar et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract e17053) treated with trametinib, as well as strong preclinical data (Rosenberger et al., 2009; 19035362, Rosseland et al., 2008; 18163378, Ricciardi et al., 2012; 22399013, Leiser et al., 2015; 25933688, Kiessling et al., 2015; 26544513), HRAS activating alterations may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, such as binimetinib, cobimetinib, trametinib, and selumetinib.

HRAS activating mutations may also predict sensitivity to farnesyl transferase inhibitors based on Phase 2 studies of tipifarnib in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with HRAS_mutated allele frequency \u226520% (ORR of 50.0% [9/18], mDOR of 14.7 months, mPFS of 5.9 months, and mOS of 15.4 months), HRAS_mutated salivary gland cancer (8.3% [1/12] PRs, 58.3% [7/12] SDs, mPFS of 7.0 months), and HRAS_mutated metastatic urothelial carcinoma (ORR of 41.7% [5/12], mPFS of 5.1 months) (Ho et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6504), as well as preclinical evidence in various cancer types (End et al., 2001; 11196150, Chen et al., 2014; 24240680, Cohen_Jonathan et al., 2000; 10931682). HRAS mutations have been associated with secondary tumors, particularly cutaneous SCCs, occurring after treatment of primary tumors with RAF inhibitors (Oberholzer et al., 2012; 22067401, Su et al., 2012; 22256804, Lacouture et al., 2013; 23457002). Preclinical studies have also reported that activating HRAS mutations are associated with resistance to EGFR inhibitors (Hah et al., 2013; 24123531, Frasca et al., 2013; 23559083, Kasper et al., 2013; 22797062).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "IGF1R", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "IGF1R encodes insulin_like growth factor_1 receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by IGF_1 and IGF_2 and mediates anti_apoptotic signals (Buck and Mulvihill, 2011; 21446886). Overexpression or activation of IGF_1R may lead to tumor formation (Werner, 2012; 21963847). IGF1R has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210) and may be biologically relevant in this context (Zack et al., 2013; 24071852, Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). In bladder urothelial carcinoma, IGF1R mutations have been reported in 3.9% of samples analyzed in the TCGA dataset, while putative high_level IGF1R amplification has been reported in fewer than 1% of cases (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 24476821). In another study, IGF1R amplification was not found in any of 97 bladder urothelial carcinoma samples (Iyer et al., 2013; 23897969). Increased expression of IGF1R has been reported in 62_74% of invasive bladder cancer tissues, including in invasive bladder urothelial carcinomas (Rochester et al., 2007; 17645417, Metalli et al., 2010; 20395438, Gonzalez_Roibon et al., 2014; 24713135). Elevated IGF1R expression in bladder cancer has been correlated with increased tumor grade and tumor stage, recurrence, and poor prognosis (Iozzo et al., 2011; 21840990, Gonzalez_Roibon et al., 2014; 24713135). IGF1R_based therapies including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; dalotuzumab, figitumumab, cixutumumab, ganitumab, R1508, and AVE1642), tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting IGF1R (linsitinib), and mAbs against IGF1R ligands (MEDI_573 and BI836845) are in preclinical and clinical development (Iams et al., 2015; 26429980, Adachi et al., 2010; 21154998, Arnaldez and Helman, 2012; 22520978). Phase 2 studies evaluating single_agent IGF1R mAbs in patients with sarcoma reported stable disease (SD) in 16_40% of cases, partial responses (PRs) in 2_12% of cases, and complete responses in 2/2 patients with Ewing sarcoma (Juergens et al., 2011; 22025154, Schoffski et al., 2013; 23835252, Pappo et al., 2011; 22025149, Iams et al., 2015; 26429980). Clinical benefit was also reported for patients with thymic malignancies treated with cixutumumab monotherapy in a Phase 2 study, with a disease control rate of 89% (33/37), including 5 PRs, for patients with thymomas and SD in 42% (5/12) of patients with thymic carcinoma (Rajan et al., 2014; 24439931). Limited clinical efficacy has been reported for single_agent ganitumab in genomically unstratified patients with neuroendocrine tumors (Strosberg et al., 2013; 23572164), ganitumab plus hormonal therapy in previously treated breast cancer (Robertson et al., 2013; 23414585), and single_agent linsitinib in adrenocortical carcinoma (Fassnacht et al., 2015; 25795408). Because IGF1R signaling is upstream of critical signaling pathways, combination therapies with IGF1R inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors may be beneficial (Badzio et al., 2010; 21124078, Kato et al., 1993; 7679099, Zong et al., 2000; 10747872). It is unclear if the combination of IGFR1 mAb with mTOR inhibitors is superior to IGF1R mAb alone for the treatment of sarcomas (Iams et al., 2015; 26429980). Phase 1 studies evaluating the combination of IGF1R mAbs with mTOR inhibitors in breast cancer have been mixed (Di Cosimo et al., 2015; 25320355, Ma et al., 2013; 23605083). Although the combination of linsitinib with everolimus to treat colorectal cancer did not lead to clinical benefit (Bendell et al., 2015; 25335932), clinical activity was reported in a Phase 1 study evaluating the combination of linsitinib and erlotinib in patients with various solid tumors (Macaulay et al., 2016; 26831715). Preclinical studies indicate that IGF1R kinase inhibitors synergize with CDK4 inhibitors to suppress the growth of cancers that depend on CDK4 (Miller et al., 2013; 24065146, Heilmann et al., 2014; 24986516).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "MLL2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "splice site 4237_2A>T, splice site 14644_2A>T", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": [{"dnaFraction": "32.23", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "splice site 4237_2A>T"}, {"dnaFraction": "33.05", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "splice site 14644_2A>T"}]}, "Interpretation": "MLL2 encodes an H3K4_specific histone methyltransferase that is involved in the transcriptional response to progesterone signaling (Vicent et al., 2011; 21447625).

A significant number of inactivating MLL2 alterations have been observed in multiple tumor types, suggesting a tumor suppressor role (Fagan et al.,2019; 31128216). MLL2 alterations are observed in a number of solid tumor contexts (cBio_Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359), and are especially prevalent in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2012; 22960745) and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) (Augert et al., 2017; 28007623). MLL2 mutation was found to be an independent prognostic factor of poor PFS and OS in non_small cell lung cancer, but not in SCLC (Ardeshir_Larijani et al., 2018; 29627316). One study reported that MLL2 truncating mutations were more common in recurrent ovary granulosa cell tumors (GCT) compared with primary GCTs (24% [10/42] vs. 3.0% [1/32])(Hillman et al., 2018; 29950560). In a study of esophageal SCC, high MLL2 expression positively correlated with tumor stage, differentiation, and size, and negatively correlated with OS (Abudureheman et al., 2018; 29532228). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in MLL2. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors may detect nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

The two most frequently reported MUTYH loss of function mutations are G382D (also referred to as G396D) and Y165C (also referred to as Y179C) (Molatore et al., 2010; 19953527, Kundu et al., 2009; 19836313, D Agostino et al., 2010; 20418187, Hegde et al., 2014; 24310308, Aretz et al., 2013; 22872101). Numerous other MUTYH mutations have also been shown to result in loss of function (Molatore et al., 2010; 19953527, Kundu et al., 2009; 19836313, Ali et al., 2008; 18534194, D Agostino et al., 2010; 20418187). In general, somatic MUTYH mutations are infrequently reported across cancer types (COSMIC, 2023)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Monoallelic MUTYH mutation occurs in 1_2% of the general population (Hegde et al., 2014; 24310308, Aretz et al., 2013; 22872101). There is conflicting data regarding the impact of monoallelic mutations on the risk of developing CRC (Win et al., 2014; 24444654, Lubbe et al., 2009; 19620482, Jones et al., 2009; 19394335). Patients with MUTYH_mutant CRC were reported to have significantly improved overall survival compared to patients without MUTYH mutation (Nielsen et al., 2010; 21044966). There are no therapies or clinical trials available to address MUTYH alterations in cancer. One or more of the MUTYH variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with MUTYH_associated polyposis (ClinVar, Sep 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline biallelic MUTYH mutation causes MUTYH_associated polyposis (also known as MYH_associated polyposis or MAP), an autosomal recessive condition characterized by multiple colorectal adenomas and increased lifetime risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) (Hegde et al., 2014; 24310308, Sampson et al., 2003; 12853198, Sieber et al., 2003; 12606733, Al_Tassan et al., 2002; 11818965). MAP accounts for approximately 0.7% of all CRC cases and 2% of early_onset CRC cases (Hegde et al., 2014; 24310308). In contrast to CRC, the role of MUTYH mutation in the context of other cancer types is not well established (Rennert et al., 2012; 21952991, Zhang et al., 2006; 16492928, von der Th\u00fcsen et al., 2011; 21189386, Casper et al., 2014; 24420788, Smith et al., 2009; 20110747). Estimates for the prevalence of MAP in the general population range from 1:5,000_1:10,000 (Aretz et al., 2013; 22872101).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI has been detected in 26_49% of urothelial carcinomas (Mylona et al., 2008; 18254781, Amira et al., 2003; 14501713); MSI_H has also been reported in multiple case studies of upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (Bai et al., 2013; 23690119).

STAG2 deletion has been shown to promote tumorigenesis in preclinical studies (Evers et al., 2014; 24484537), and STAG2 inactivation has been proposed to promote tumorigenesis via a mechanism that involves increased aneuploidy (Guo et al., 2013; 24121792, Solomon et al., 2013; 24121789, Solomon et al., 2011; 21852505) or altered transcriptional regulation (Thota et al., 2014; 25006131, Balb\u00e1s_Mart\u00ednez et al., 2013; 24121791, Kon et al., 2013; 23955599, Taylor et al., 2014; 24270882). STAG2 mutations have been observed most frequently in urothelial bladder carcinoma (16_35%) (Solomon et al., 2013; 24121789, Balb\u00e1s_Mart\u00ednez et al., 2013; 24121791, Guo et al., 2013; 24121792, Taylor et al., 2014; 24270882, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 24476821), Ewing sarcoma (13_22%) (Tirode et al., 2014; 25223734, Brohl et al., 2014; 25010205), upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (11%) (Hoang et al., 2013; 23926200), myeloid malignancies (6%) (Thota et al., 2014; 25006131, Kon et al., 2013; 23955599), and glioblastoma (6%) (Solomon et al., 2011; 21852505). STAG2 truncation mutations are associated with loss of protein expression (Solomon et al., 2013; 24121789, Balb\u00e1s_Mart\u00ednez et al., 2013; 24121791, Taylor et al., 2014; 24270882, Brohl et al., 2014; 25010205). In patients with Ewing sarcoma, STAG2 and TP53 mutations often co_occur and are associated with decreased overall survival, although mutation of either STAG2 or TP53 alone was not demonstrated to affect survival (Tirode et al., 2014; 25223734, Brohl et al., 2014; 25010205). STAG2 mutation in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome is associated with decreased overall survival and has also been associated with increased response to treatment with azacitidine or decitabine in patients with myeloid malignancies (Thota et al., 2014; 25006131). The data on the prognostic significance of STAG2 mutation or loss of STAG2 protein expression in the context of urothelial bladder carcinoma are conflicting (Solomon et al., 2013; 24121789, Balb\u00e1s_Mart\u00ednez et al., 2013; 24121791, Guo et al., 2013; 24121792, Taylor et al., 2014; 24270882). In patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, loss of STAG2 staining was significantly associated with decreased overall survival, but was also associated with survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy (Evers et al., 2014; 24484537). An inactivating STAG2 mutation was identified in a patient with melanoma that acquired resistance to vemurafenib and preclinical evidence suggests that loss of STAG2 expression decreases the sensitivity of BRAF V600E_positive melanoma cells to vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and trametinib (Shen et al., 2016; 27500726). There are no therapies that directly target STAG2. However, in preclinical studies, STAG2 inactivation by mutation or knockdown resulted in increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Bailey et al., 2014; 24356817) or oxaliplatin (Evers et al., 2014; 24484537).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "K132*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "53.13", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "K132*"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 mutation has been reported in 49\u201354% of bladder urothelial carcinoma (UC) (Ross et al., 2013; 23887298, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014; 24476821), 33% of renal pelvis UC (Bringuier et al., 1998; 9761125), and 25% (22/71) of ureter UC samples (Furihata et al., 2000; 10675480). Expression of p53 has been correlated with TP53 mutation, and reported in 52\u201384% of bladder cancers (Esrig et al., 1993; 7901994, Cordon_Cardo et al., 1994; 7906253, Diaz_Cano et al., 2000; 10744064, Kapur et al., 2011; 21571954, Lotan et al., 2013; 23571005, Kim et al., 2014; 25092538), 48% (24/50) bladder SCCs (El_Kenawy et al., 2003; 14756544), 36\u201353% of upper urinary tract UCs (UTUC) (Joung et al., 2008; 18931548, Jinza et al., 1998; 9644783, Kamijima et al., 2005; 16351648), and in 4/4 urethral clear cell carcinomas (Alexiev et al., 2013; 23307189). TP53 mutations in both bladder and renal pelvis urothelial carcinoma (UC) are more common in invasive tumors (Bringuier et al., 1998; 9761125, Goebell and Knowles, 2010; 20610279, Lindgren et al., 2012; 22685613, Kim et al., 2014; 25092538), and have been associated with inferior survival in patients with renal pelvis UC (Bringuier et al., 1998; 9761125) or upper tract UC (UTUC) (Feng et al., 2014; 24500328). Alterations to the p53 pathway are correlated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in bladder cancer (Eissa et al., 2010; 20012564, Mitra et al., 2007; 17710407, Lambrou et al., 2013; 23624844), and p53 overexpression has been linked to poor progression_free survival in UTUC (Lee et al., 2013; 23482786, Feng et al., 2014; 24500328), disease progression in UC of the renal pelvis and ureter (Hashimoto et al., 2000; 11168685), and higher tumor grade in bladder squamous cell carcinoma (Osman et al., 1997; 9815716, Helal et al., 2006; 16998598, Jalali et al., 2011; 22126554). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true",
