R132 is located within the active site of IDH1 and is a hotspot for mutations in cancer (Jin et al., 2011; 21326614, Gross et al., 2010; 20142433, Ward et al., 2010; 20171147, Leonardi et al., 2012; 22442146, Reitman and Yan, 2010; 20513808). Substitutions at IDH1 R132 alter the enzymatic activity of IDH1, resulting in the production of the oncometabolite, D_2_hydroxyglutarate (2_HG)(Dang et al., 2009; 19935646, Ward et al., 2012; 21996744, Ward et al., 2010; 20171147, Gross et al., 2010; 20142433, Leonardi et al., 2012; 22442146), which promotes tumorigenesis (Gross et al., 2010; 20142433, Figueroa et al., 2010; 21130701, Xu et al., 2011; 21251613, Turcan et al., 2012; 22343889, Duncan et al., 2012; 22899282). IDH1 or IDH2 mutation has been reported in 10_23% of cholangiocarcinoma cases and has been found to be more prevalent in intrahepatic (22_28%) than extrahepatic (0_7%) cholangiocarcinomas (Voss et al., 2013; 23391413, Sia et al., 2013; 23318457, Kipp et al., 2012; 22503487, Ross et al., 2014; 24563076, Borger et al., 2012; 22180306, Wang et al., 2013; 22824796). In patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, IDH1/2 mutations are associated with longer OS and increased time to tumor recurrence (Wang et al., 2013; 22824796). A preclinical study observed that mutant IDH can block hepatocyte differentiation and cooperate with oncogenic KRAS to drive cholangiocarcinoma development (Saha et al., 2014; 25043045). IDH1 mutations that lead to production of 2_HG, most commonly R132 alterations, may predict sensitivity to IDH1_mutation_specific inhibitors such as ivosidenib (Abou_Alfa et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA10, Fan et al., 2019; 31028664, Mellinghoff et al., 2017; SNO Abstract ACTR_46, Tap et al., 2016; CTOS Abstract P1_138). A Phase 1b/2 study of the IDH1 inhibitor olutasidenib for patients with IDH1_mutated glioma reported a DCR of 50% (n=24) with 1 PR (De La Fuente et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 2505). A Phase 1 study of the pan_IDH1/IDH2 inhibitor vorasidenib for patients with IDH1_ or IDH2_mutated glioma reported an ORR of 18.2% (4/22; RANO criteria) and median PFS of 31.4 months for non_enhancing cases and median PFS of 7.5 months for the overall glioma population (n=52) (Mellinghoff et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 2504). Preclinical studies suggested that IDH1 neomorphic mutations may also confer sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Philip et al., 2018; 29719265, Molenaar et al., 2018; 29339439, Lu et al., 2017; 28202508, Sulkowski et al., 2017; 28148839).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "IDH1 mutations may predict sensitivity to IDH1 inhibitors.

KRAS alterations affecting amino acids G12, G13, Q22, P34, A59, Q61, and A146, as well as mutations G10_A11insG, G10_A11insAG (also reported as G10_A11dup and G12_G13insAG), A18D, L19F, D33E, G60_A66dup/E62_A66dup, E62K, R68S, and K117N have been characterized as activating and oncogenic (Akagi et al., 2007; 17150185, Bollag et al., 1996; 8955068, Buhrman et al., 2010; 20194776, Colicelli, 2004; 15367757, Edkins et al., 2006; 16969076, Feig and Cooper, 1988; 3043178, Gremer et al., 2011; 20949621, Janakiraman et al., 2010; 20570890, Kim et al., 2016; 27147599, Lukman et al., 2010; 20838576, Naguib et al., 2011; 21371307, Prior et al., 2012; 22589270, Priv\u00e9 et al., 1992; 1565661, Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Scheffzek et al., 1997; 9219684, Scholl et al., 2009; 19490892, Smith et al., 2010; 20147967, Tyner et al., 2009; 19075190, Valencia et al., 1991; 2029511, White et al., 2016; 26854029, Wiest et al., 1994; 8058307, Kim et al., 2016; 27147599, Angeles et al., 2019; 31289513, Tong et al., 2014; 24642870, Loree et al., 2021; 34117033). KRAS mutations have been observed with an incidence of 13_50% in cholangiocarcinoma (Hsu et al., 2013; 23335286, Voss et al., 2013; 23391413, Chang et al., 2013; 24372748, Liau et al., 2014; 24406866, O Dell et al., 2012; 22266220, Borger et al., 2012; 22180306, Andersen et al., 2012; 22178589). One study observed a higher frequency of KRAS mutations in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas with bile duct histology (23/98) versus tumors with cholangiolar histology (1/76) (Liau et al., 2014; 24406866). While some studies have reported no association between KRAS mutation and prognosis in cholangiocarcinoma (Borbath et al., 2013; 23975665, Liau et al., 2014; 24406866), other studies have reported an association of KRAS mutation with poorer survival in patients with gallbladder or extrahepatic biliary tract cancers (Javle et al., 2014; 24508317, Malats et al., 1995; 7602358). In a Phase 1 study evaluating the MEK_pan_RAF dual inhibitor CH5126766, 6 patients harboring KRAS mutations experienced PRs, including 3 with non_small cell lung cancer (NCSLC), 1 with low_grade serous ovarian carcinoma (LGSOC), 1 with endometrial adenocarcinoma, and 1 with multiple myeloma (Guo et al., 2020; 3312887). Another Phase 1 study of CH5126766 combined with the FAK inhibitor defactinib reported 4 PRs in KRAS_mutated LGSOC (Shinde et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT143). Preclinical and clinical data suggest that KRAS mutations may predict clinical benefit from SHP2 inhibitors (Lu et al., 2019; 31068384, Mainardi et al., 2018; 29808006, Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001, Brana et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3005, Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). A Phase 1 study of RMC_4630 for relapsed/refractory solid tumors reported a DCR of 58% (23/40) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS mutations and a DCR of 75% (12/16) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS G12C mutations (Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001). Interim results from a Phase 1/2 study of RMC_4630 plus cobimetinib reported tumor reduction in 3 of 8 patients with KRAS_mutated colorectal cancer (Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). Preclinical evidence suggests that KRAS activation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, such as trametinib, binimetinib, cobimetinib, and selumetinib (Nakano et al., 1984; 6320174, Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Yamaguchi et al., 2011; 21523318, Watanabe et al., 2013; 23438367, Gilmartin et al., 2011; 21245089, Yeh et al., 2009; 19372556). Preclinical data suggest that KRAS mutation may confer sensitivity to SOS1 inhibitors (Hillig et al., 2019; 30683722, Hofmann et al., 2021; 32816843, Gerlach et al., 2020; AACR Abstract 1091). Phase 1 studies of the SOS1 inhibitor BI 1701963 alone or in combination with MEK inhibitors, KRAS G12C inhibitors, or irinotecan are recruiting for patients with solid tumors harboring KRAS mutations (Hofmann et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT210, Gort et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract TPS3651). However, Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials of MEK inhibitor monotherapies reported no objective responses (4/4 SD) for patients with biliary tract cancer harboring KRAS mutations (Finn et al., 2018; 29785570, Bekaii_Saab et al., 2011; 21519026). Although a Phase 1/2 study of binimetinib in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin observed a 33% ORR (1 PR, n=3) for patients with KRAS_mutated advanced biliary tract cancer, this was comparable with the 36% ORR (3 CRs, 9 PRs, n=33) of the overall study population (Lowery et al., 2019; 30563938). One study reported that patients with mutations in the RAS_MAPK pathway may be sensitive to binimetinib and capecitabine; patients with KRAS_, NRAS_, or MEK_mutated gemcitabine_pretreated biliary tract cancer experienced improved mPFS (5.4 vs. 2.6 months, p=0.031), mOS (10.8 vs. 5.3 months, p=0.011), and ORR (40% vs. 12.5%) as compared with patients lacking these mutations (Kim et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 4079).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "KRAS activating mutations or amplification may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of MAPK pathway components, including MEK inhibitors.

Alterations such as seen here may disrupt BAP1 function or expression (Ventii et al., 2008; 18757409, Chan_On et al., 2013; 24185513, Abdel_Rahman et al., 2011; 21941004, Testa et al., 2011; 21874000, Wiesner et al., 2011; 21874003, Farley et al., 2013; 23709298, Aoude et al., 2013; 23977234, Peng et al., 2018; 29284740, Nishikawa et al., 2009; 19117993, Zhang et al., 2018; 30202049). In cholangiocarcinoma, BAP1 mutation has been reported in 7_27% of cases (cBio_Chan_On et al., 2013; 24185513, cBio_Jiao et al., 2013; 24185509, Simbolo et al., 2014; 24867389) with one study reporting higher frequency in cases unrelated to to liver fluke (O. viverrini) infection (10% versus 3%)(Chan_On et al., 2013; 24185513). BAP1 loss has been reported in 0_2% of cholangiocarcinomas (cBio_Sanchez_Vega et al., 2018; 29625050, cBio_Lowery et al., 2018; 29848569). Loss of BAP1 protein expression was reported in 19.4% of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (Misumi et al., 2017; 27864835). In a study of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, BAP1 protein loss significantly associated with improved overall and recurrence_fee survival (Misumi et al., 2017; 27864835). In patients with gallbladder carcinoma, a significant association between low BAP1 expression and reduced median overall survival was reported (Hirosawa et al., 2018; 30395583). Clinical (Zauderer et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 8515) and preclinical (LaFave et al., 2015; 26437366) evidence in the context of mesothelioma suggests that tumors with BAP1 inactivation may be sensitive to EZH2 inhibitors such as tazemetostat. Preclinical studies suggest that BAP1 is involved in the DNA damage response (Yu et al., 2014; 24347639, Ismail et al., 2014; 24894717, Pe\u00f1a_Llopis et al., 2012; 22683710, Nishi et al., 2014; 25194926), and BAP1 inactivation might be associated with sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Pe\u00f1a_Llopis et al., 2012; 22683710, Ismail et al., 2014; 24894717, Zhang et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e23192). One preclinical study suggests that HDAC inhibitors may be beneficial in BAP1_mutated uveal melanoma; however, it is unclear if these inhibitors are effective in other BAP1_mutated cancers (Landreville et al., 2012; 22038994). BAP1 germline inactivating alterations, including mutations and deletions, are associated with BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome (BAP1_TPDS), an autosomal_dominant syndrome characterized by early onset of benign melanocytic skin tumors (Walpole et al., 2018; 30517737, Testa et al., 2011; 21874000, 23550303, Boru et al., 2019; 30883995). An estimated 2% of patients with BAP1_inactivated melanocytic tumors display germline BAP1 mutations (Garfield et al., 2018; 29753057). Later in life, patients have an increased risk of cancers such as uveal melanoma, mesothelioma, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and meningioma (Abdel_Rahman et al., 2011; 21941004, Testa et al., 2011; 21874000, Wiesner et al., 2011; 21874003, Farley et al., 2013; 23709298, Aoude et al., 2013; 23977234, Shankar et al., 2017; 28170043). In small studies, the prevalence of pathogenic germline BAP1 mutation has been reported as 22% in familial uveal melanoma and 4.4% in mesothelioma (Rai et al., 2017; 27718540, Zauderer et al., 2019; 31323388).

TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). High bTMB levels were not detected in this sample. It is unclear whether the bTMB levels in this sample would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Depending on the clinical context, TMB testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. Average bTMB levels in solid tumors other than NSCLC have not been evaluated (cBioPortal, COSMIC, PubMed, Mar 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of bTMB levels in biliary tract cancer are limited (PubMed, Jul 2021). Although cases with hypermutated biliary tract cancer were enriched in a subgroup with poor prognosis in 1 study (Nakamura et al., 2015; 26258846), TMB_high (\u226510 mut/Mb) status in biliary adenocarcinoma not treated with immunotherapy was not significantly associated with OS in another study, in which patients with TMB_high tumors experienced numerically longer OS compared with patients with TMB_low tumors (11.5 vs. 8.4 months, adjusted HR=0.65) (Shao et al., 2020; 33119110). On the basis of clinical evidence in NSCLC and HSNCC, increased bTMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511) and anti_PD_1 (Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074) therapies. In NSCLC, multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 to 16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). In HNSCC, a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Cannot Be Determined", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Cannot Be Determined"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI_H is infrequent in cholangiocarcinoma, reported in 1% of samples (Javle et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 4087). A non_zero level of MSI has been reported in 18_49% of cholangiocarcinoma cases (Momoi et al., 2001; 11580146, Limpaiboon et al., 2002; 12175538, Liu et al., 2002; 12402306, Liengswangwong et al., 2003; 14506736), although the studies did not specify what fraction of cases were MSI_H. A higher frequency of MSI (63%) was reported in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma associated with exposure to Thorotrast (Liu et al., 2002; 12402306). One study reported that MSI is associated with poor prognosis in liver fluke_related cholangiocarcinoma (Limpaiboon et al., 2002; 12175538). On the basis of prospective clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD_1_targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143) and PD_L1_targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92). As the MSI status of this tumor is unknown, the relevance of these therapeutic approaches is unclear. While approximately 80% of MSI_H tumors arise due to somatic inactivation of an MMR pathway protein, about 20% arise due to germline mutations in one of the MMR genes (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942), which are associated with a condition known as Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC) (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756). Lynch syndrome leads to an increased risk of colorectal, endometrial, gastric, and other cancers (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756, Pande et al., 2012; 22714864, Kastrinos and Syngal, 2007; 17920897) and has an estimated prevalence in the general population ranging from 1:600 to 1:2000 (Silva et al., 2009; 19466295, Sehgal et al., 2014; 24978665, de la Chapelle et al., 2005; 16136383).

Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. Inactivation of p53, through mutation, deletion, or loss of heterozygosity (LOH), has been observed in 25_63% of gallbladder carcinomas and 10_61% of cholangiocarcinomas (Li et al., 2014; 24997986, Ross et al., 2014; 24563076, Jiao et al., 2013; 24185509, Chan_On et al., 2013; 24185513, Borger et al., 2012; 22180306, Suto et al., 2000; 10738270, Ong et al., 2012; 22561520, Javle et al., 2016; 27622582, Nakamura et al., 2015; 26258846, Nault and Zucman_Rossi, 2011; 21538283). TP53 mutations occur more frequently in tumors caused by liver fluke (O. viverrini) infection (40%) than in cholangiocarcinoma cases not related to infection (9%) (Chan_On et al., 2013; 24185513). Aberrant TP53 expression, which is indicative of TP53 dysregulation, has been observed in 20\u201362% of gallbladder carcinomas and 25% (5/20) of cholangiocarcinomas (Won et al., 2010; 20955617, Chaube et al., 2006; 16686942, Chuang et al., 2004; 15573254). Data regarding the prognostic significance of TP53 mutation in cholangiocarcinoma are conflicting (Ruzzenente et al., 2016; 26717940, Xiaofang et al., 2012; 22230750, Ajiki et al., 1996; 8799388, Saetta, 2006; 16724348, Guo et al., 2014; 24746206, Boerner et al., 2021; 33765338, Conci et al., 2020; 32020551, Simbolo et al., 2018; 29740198, Churi et al., 2014; 25536104). Overexpression of p53 protein has been associated with reduced patient survival in poorly differentiated gallbladder adenocarcinomas and biliary tract cancers (Lee and Pirdas, 1995; 7567135, Ahrendt et al., 2000; 11180865); however, another study did not find such a correlation (Ajiki et al., 1996; 8799388). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% (17/176) and SDs in 53.4% (94/176) of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21.1% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12.1% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wild_type (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 31.9% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73.4% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 42.9% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76.2% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24.0% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71.4% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75.0% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Additionally, the combination of a CHK1 inhibitor and irinotecan reportedly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival in a TP53_mutated, but not TP53_wild_type, breast cancer xenotransplant mouse model (Ma et al., 2012; 22446188). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may also be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as APR_246 (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571, Lehmann et al., 2012; 22965953, Mohell et al., 2015; 26086967, Franssonet al., 2016; 27179933). In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, APR_246 combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}, {"Name": "P92L", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "P92L"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675).

Inactivation of p53, through mutation, deletion, or loss of heterozygosity (LOH), has been observed in 25_63% of gallbladder carcinomas and 10_61% of cholangiocarcinomas (Li et al., 2014; 24997986, Ross et al., 2014; 24563076, Jiao et al., 2013; 24185509, Chan_On et al., 2013; 24185513, Borger et al., 2012; 22180306, Suto et al., 2000; 10738270, Ong et al., 2012; 22561520, Javle et al., 2016; 27622582, Nakamura et al., 2015; 26258846, Nault and Zucman_Rossi, 2011; 21538283). TP53 mutations occur more frequently in tumors caused by liver fluke (O. viverrini) infection (40%) than in cholangiocarcinoma cases not related to infection (9%) (Chan_On et al., 2013; 24185513). Aberrant TP53 expression, which is indicative of TP53 dysregulation, has been observed in 20\u201362% of gallbladder carcinomas and 25% (5/20) of cholangiocarcinomas (Won et al., 2010; 20955617, Chaube et al., 2006; 16686942, Chuang et al., 2004; 15573254). Data regarding the prognostic significance of TP53 mutation in cholangiocarcinoma are conflicting (Ruzzenente et al., 2016; 26717940, Xiaofang et al., 2012; 22230750, Ajiki et al., 1996; 8799388, Saetta, 2006; 16724348, Guo et al., 2014; 24746206, Boerner et al., 2021; 33765338, Conci et al., 2020; 32020551, Simbolo et al., 2018; 29740198, Churi et al., 2014; 25536104). Overexpression of p53 protein has been associated with reduced patient survival in poorly differentiated gallbladder adenocarcinomas and biliary tract cancers (Lee and Pirdas, 1995; 7567135, Ahrendt et al., 2000; 11180865); however, another study did not find such a correlation (Ajiki et al., 1996; 8799388). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% (17/176) and SDs in 53.4% (94/176) of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21.1% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12.1% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wild_type (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 31.9% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73.4% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 42.9% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76.2% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24.0% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71.4% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75.0% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Additionally, the combination of a CHK1 inhibitor and irinotecan reportedly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival in a TP53_mutated, but not TP53_wild_type, breast cancer xenotransplant mouse model (Ma et al., 2012; 22446188). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may also be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as APR_246 (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571, Lehmann et al., 2012; 22965953, Mohell et al., 2015; 26086967, Franssonet al., 2016; 27179933). In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, APR_246 combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Fraction", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction Not Detected", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction Not Detected"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor fraction provides an estimate of the percentage of ctDNA present in a cell_free DNA (cfDNA) sample. The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with elevated tumor fraction values have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus high sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at low risk of false negative results. However, if elevated tumor fraction is not detected, it does not exclude the presence of disease burden or compromise the confidence of reported alterations. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels. In the research setting, changes in tumor fraction estimates have been associated with treatment duration and clinical response and may be a useful indicator for future cancer management (Bronkhorst et al., 2019; 30923679, Raja et al., 2018; 30093454, Hrebien et al., 2019; 30860573, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5039, Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Goodall et al., 2017; 28450425, Goldberg et al., 2018; 29330207).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "IDH1", "Alteration": "R132L", "Title": "Ascending Doses of AZD6738 in Combination With Chemotherapy and/or Novel Anti Cancer Agents", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1/2", "Target": "ATR, PARP, PD_L1", "Locations": "Seongnam_si (Korea, Republic of), Seoul (Korea, Republic of), Cambridge (United Kingdom), Withington (United Kingdom), London (United Kingdom), Sutton (United Kingdom), Villejuif (France), Saint Herblain (France), California", "NCTID": "NCT02264678", "Note": "IDH1 mutations may predict sensitivity to IDH1 inhibitors.
