CDK4 and its functional homolog CDK6 are activated by D_type cyclins and promote cell cycle progression by inactivating the tumor suppressor Rb (Weinberg et al., 1995; 7736585, Musgrove et al., 2011; 21734724). Amplification of the chromosomal region that includes CDK4 has been reported in multiple cancer types, including lung cancer, glioblastoma, and liposarcoma, and has been associated with overexpression of CDK4 protein (Wikman et al., 2005; 15543620, Rao et al., 2010; 19609742, Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Chung et al., 2009; 19574885, Ragazzini et al., 2004; 15024701, Dujardin et al., 2011; 21336260, Zhang et al., 2013; 23393200, Horvai et al., 2009; 19734852). CDK4 amplification has been reported in 6.5% of lung adenocarcinoma cases and 0.4% of lung squamous cell carcinoma cases (cBio_Campbell et al., 2016; 27158780). CDK4 amplification correlated with high CDK4 gene and protein expression in lung tumors (Wikman et al., 2005; 15543620). High CDK4 protein expression has been detected in 23_47% of non_small cell lung cancers, specifically in 38% (18/47) of lung adenocarcinomas, 44% (4/9) of lung squamous cell carcinomas, and 83% (10/12) of large cell lung cancers (Borczuk et al., 2003; 14578194, Wikman et al., 2005; 15543620, Wu et al., 2011; 21477379). High CDK4 protein expression predicted poor OS in patients with lung cancer in one study (Wu et al., 2011; 21477379). CDK4 amplification or activation may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors such as abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib (Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27217383, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767). The LungMAP trial evaluated the efficacy of palbociclib for patients with platinum_refractory lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and cell cycle alterations, with CDK4 amplification being present in 6% (2/32) of patients, and reported an ORR of 6% (2/32 PRs overall, 0/2 PRs in CDK4_amplified tumors) and SD rate of 28% (12/32); however, palbociclib compared with docetaxel or durvalumab did not increase median PFS (1.8 vs. 2.7 vs. 2.9 months, respectively) or median OS (7.2 vs. 7.7 vs. 11.6 months, respectively)(Papadimitrakopoulou et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 9019, Edelman et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 9056). Other genomically selected trials of ribociclib and palbociclib have not reported any objective responses for patients with lung SCC (n=15 patients overall)(Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Gopalan et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8077, Clark et al., 2019; AACR Abstract LB_010/2). As second_line treatment for genomically unselected lung SCC, abemaciclib did not improve outcomes compared with docetaxel (median PFS of 2.5 vs. 4.2 months, ORR of 2.8% vs. 20.8%, and median OS of 7.0 vs. 12.4 months)(Scagliotti et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 9059).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04000529", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04282031", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03239015", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02693535", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03297606", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04116541", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05252416", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03310879", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05159245", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "MDM2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "MDM2 encodes an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p53, Rb1, and other proteins (Sdek et al., 2005; 16337594, Brady et al., 2005; 15632057, Li et al., 2004; 15053880). MDM2 acts to prevent the activity of the tumor suppressor p53; therefore, overexpression or amplification of MDM2 may be oncogenic (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675, Cordon_Cardo et al., 1994; 8306343). Overexpression or amplification of MDM2 is frequent in cancer (Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). Although two retrospective clinical studies suggest that MDM2 amplification may predict a short time_to_treatment failure on anti_PD_1/PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors, with 4/5 patients with MDM2 amplification (Kato et al., 2017; 28351930) and 2/3 patients with MDM2 or MDM4 amplification (Singavi et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 1140PD) experiencing tumor hyperprogression, amplification of MDM2 or MDM4 was not associated with shorter progression_free survival (PFS) in a retrospective analysis of non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) outcomes with immune checkpoint inhibitors (hazard ratio of 1.4, p=0.44)(Rizvi et al., 2018; 29337640). The latter study reported PFS of >2 months for 5/8 patients with MDM2/MDM4 amplification (Rizvi et al., 2018; 29337640). In the TCGA datasets, amplification of MDM2 has been reported in 7.8% of lung adenocarcinoma cases (cBio_Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014; 25079552) and 2.3% of lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cases (cBio_Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2012; 22960745). Separate studies have reported MDM2 amplification at similar incidences of 6_7% in non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), mainly in patients with adenocarcinoma, but a higher incidence of 21% (24/116) has also been observed, with amplification found in various NSCLC subtypes (Higashiyama et al., 1997; 9155050, Marchetti et al., 1995; 7551299, Dworakowska et al., 2004; 15165086). The role of MDM2 expression/amplification as a prognostic marker is complex, with some studies showing a negative and others a positive effect on survival in patients with NSCLC (Onel and Cordon_Cardo, 2004; 14757840, Dworakowska et al., 2004; 15165086, Higashiyama et al., 1997; 9155050, Ren et al., 2013; 24175836). MDM2 antagonists disrupt the MDM2_p53 interaction, thereby stabilizing p53 (Cheok et al., 2011; 20975744). Preclinical studies have suggested that the amplification of MDM2, in the absence of concurrent TP53 mutations, may increase sensitivity to these agents (Ohnstad et al., 2013; 23165797, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357). Preliminary Phase 1 studies of the MDM2_p53 antagonist alrizomadlin (APG_115) reported a PR in a patient with liposarcoma harboring an MDM2 amplification and wildtype for TP53 and SD in 21%\u201338% (6/28 and 5/13, respectively) of patients in genomically unselected solid tumors (Zhang et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3124, Rasco et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3126). A Phase 2 trial of alrizomadlin in combination with pembrolizumab reported a PR in 1 of 3 patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor that had failed standard therapy, as well as PRs in patients with multiple types of solid tumors that had failed immunotherapy, including 1 out of 14 patients with non_small cell lung cancer; 1 out of 5 patients with urothelial carcinoma; and 2 out of5, 1 out of 5, and 1 out of 11 patients with mucosal, uveal, and cutaneous melanoma, respectively (Tolcher et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 2506). Phase 1b studies of the MDM2 inhibitor idasanutlin for refractory AML in combination with cytarabine or venetoclax reported anti_leukemic response rates of 33% (25/75) and 37% (11/30), respectively (Martinelli et al., 2016; EHA21 Abstract S504, Daver et al., 2018; ASH Abstract 767); clinical benefit (58% ORR, 7/12) with idasanutlin monotherapy has been reported for patients with polycythemia vera (Mascarenhas et al., 2019; ASH Abstract 134). The dual MDM2/MDM4 inhibitor ALRN_6924 led to an ORR of 27% (4/15) for patients with TP53 wildtype peripheral T_cell lymphoma in a Phase 2 study (Shustov et al., 2018; ASH Abstract 1623); responses have also been observed in TP53 wildtype AML, MDS, Merkel cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and liposarcoma (Sallman et al., 2018; ASH Abstract 4066, Meric_Bernstam et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 2505).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Inhibitors of the MDM2_p53 interaction are being tested in clinical trials.

Certain MET alterations have been associated with the removal of exon 14 (Kong_Beltran et al., 2006; 16397241, Onozato et al., 2009; 19096300, Okuda et al., 2008; 19037978, Paik et al., 2015; 25971939, Awad et al., 2016; 26729443, Gray et al., 2015; 26637977) and/or loss of a binding site for the ubiquitin ligase CBL, an enzyme that targets MET for degradation (Kong_Beltran et al., 2006; 16397241, Peschard et al., 2004; 15123609, Lee et al., 2014; 23208509, Lee et al., 2006; 17079873). Loss of either MET exon 14 or a CBL binding site increases MET stability, leading to prolonged signaling upon HGF stimulation and increased oncogenic potential (Kong_Beltran et al., 2006; 16397241, Togashi et al., 2015; 26547802, Lee et al., 2014; 23208509, Lee et al., 2006; 17079873, Peschard et al., 2001; 11741535, Abella et al., 2005; 16227611, Gray et al., 2015; 26637977); these mutations are expected to be activating. Responses to various MET inhibitors have been reported for multiple patients with alterations in their tumors predicted to lack MET exon 14 (Drilon et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract OA12.02, Felip et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract OA12.01, Wolf et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract LBA52, Moro_Sibilot et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract OA12.03)(Frampton et al., 2015; 25971938, Paik et al., 2015; 25971939, Schrock et al., 2017; 8315738). In the Phase 2 VISION study of patients with non_small cell lung cancer, MET exon 14 skipping alterations were reported in 3.6% of patients (Le et al., 2020; AACR Abstract 3385). In one study of 4402 lung adenocarcinoma cases, MET mutations (primarily those affecting MET exon 14 splicing) have been reported in 3% of samples (Frampton et al., 2015; 25971938). In TCGA datasets, MET mutation has been observed in 8.3% of lung adenocarcinomas and 2.1% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745). Studies on the effect of MET amplification on prognosis in non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have yielded conflicting results (Yang et al., 2013; 23079155, Dziadziuszko et al., 2012; 22237262, Cappuzzo et al., 2009; 19255323, Park et al., 2012; 22207554, Chen et al., 2011; 22052229, Kanteti et al., 2009; 19817696, To et al., 2002; 11795945, Tsuta et al., 2012; 22198430). MET exon 14 splice alteration, which has predominantly been observed in lung cancer, was found to be an independent poor prognostic factor in a study of 687 patients with NSCLC (Tong et al., 2016; 26847053). However, other studies did not find MET exon 14 splice alteration to be a major risk factor for OS for patients with NSCLC, although recurrence rate was significantly higher for patients with exon 14 splice alteration compared with those with ALK fusion (Lee et al., 2017; 28502721, Gow et al., 2017; 28024701). Among patients with NSCLC and exon 14 alterations who had not been previously treated with a MET inhibitor, a non_significant trend for reduced survival was noted in the context of concurrent MET amplification (5.2 vs. 10.5 months, p=0.06) (Awad et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 8511). On the basis of extensive clinical evidence, MET amplification or activating mutations may predict sensitivity to MET_targeting therapies such as kinase inhibitors crizotinib, capmatinib, tepotinib, and cabozantinib. MET inhibitors crizotinib, capmatinib, PF_04217903, tepotinib, glesatinib, savolitinib, and foretinib have provided benefit for patients with MET_mutated papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (Choueiri et al., 2013; 23213094, Diamond et al., 2013; 23610116, Stein et al., 2015; 25457019, Choueiri et al., 2020; 32469384), histiocytic sarcoma (Frampton et al., 2015; 25971938), and non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of varied histologies (Drilon et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract OA12.02, Felip et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract OA12.01, Wolf et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9004, Schuler et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9067, Kollmannsberger et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 2589, Engstrom et al., 2017; 28765324, Paik et al., 2015; 25971939, Mazieres et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 1283P, Jenkins et al., 2015; 25769807, Waqar et al., 2015; 25898962, Mendenhall and Goldman, 2015; 25898965). Patients with MET exon 14 mutated NSCLC who were treated with 1 of several MET inhibitors exhibited superior outcomes (median OS 24.6 vs. 8.1 months; HR=0.11, p=0.04) compared with patients who were not treated with a MET inhibitor (Awad et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 8511). Tepotinib showed durable clinical activity in patients with NSCLC with MET exon 14 skipping mutations (Paik et al., 2020; 32469185, Mazieres et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 1283P), and yielded a PR lasting 9 months for a patient with HLA_DRB1_MET fusion_positive NSCLC (Blanc_Durand et al., 2020; 32716573). In another study, 11 patients with hereditary papillary RCC and germline MET mutations (4 of which were H1094R) experienced 5 PRs and 5 SDs after treatment with foretinib (Choueiri et al., 2013; 23213094). Savolitinib yielded ORRs of 49% (30/61) in patients with MET exon 14 mutated NSCLC (Lu et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 9519) and numerically higher ORR for patients with MET_driven papillary RCC compared to sunitinib (27% [9/33] vs. 7.4% [2/27]) (Choueiri et al., 2020; 32469384). A Phase 1 study for patients with MET_altered NSCLC treated with MET inhibitor bozitinib monotherapy reported an overall ORR of 30.6% (11/36) and DCR of 97.2% (35/36) with MET overexpression, amplification, and exon 14 skipping demonstrating ORRs of 35.7% (5/14), 41.2% (7/17), and 66.7% (10/15), respectively; increased ORRs were observed in patients with both exon 14 skipping and amplification (100%, 4/4) and with both amplification and overexpression (50%, 3/6)(Yang et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT127). A Phase 2 study evaluating the MET inhibitor savolitinib for patients with MET exon 14 splice site mutation_positive pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma and other types of non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) reported an ORR of 43% (30/70), median PFS of 6.8 months, and median OS of 12.5 months (Lu et al., 2021; 34166627, Lu et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 2MO). In the Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study, patients with NSCLC harboring MET exon 14 skipping mutations treated with amivantamab achieved a 33% (12/36) ORR; 4 out of 19 patients previously treated with MET TKIs responded (Krebs et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 9008).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Activating MET alterations may confer sensitivity to MET inhibitors.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Tepotinib", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Tepotinib is a selective MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is FDA approved to treat patients with non_small cell lung cancer harboring MET exon 14 skipping alterations.

PIK3CA alterations that have been characterized as activating, such as observed here, are predicted to be oncogenic (Kang et al., 2005; 15647370, Ikenoue et al., 2005; 15930273, Gymnopoulos et al., 2007; 17376864, Horn et al., 2008; 18317450, Rudd et al., 2011; 21266528, Hon et al., 2012; 22120714, Burke et al., 2012; 22949682, Wu et al., 2009; 19915146, Dbouk et al., 2010; 2103068, Dan et al., 2010; 20530683, Oda et al., 2008; 18829572, Zhao and Vogt, 2008; 18794883, Lui et al., 2013; 23619167, Ross et al., 2013; 22430209, Riviere et al., 2012; 22729224, Shibata et al., 2009; 19394761, Droguluk et al., 2015; 26627007, Croessmann et al., 2018; 29284706, Ng et al., 2018; 29533785, Spangle et al., 2020; 32929011, Chen et al., 2018; 29636477, Jin et al., 2021; 34779417).

The prognostic significance of PIK3CA mutation or overexpression in NSCLC is unclear, with several studies reporting contradictory data, which may be influenced by the specific PIK3CA mutation, histologic subtype, and the presence of concurrent mutations in oncogenes such as EGFR and KRAS (Zhao et al., 2014; 24328409, Eng et al., 2015; 26334752, Song et al., 2016; 27554588, Zhang et al., 2013; 23674897, McGowan et al., 2017; 28024696, Wang et al., 2015; 26107237). Clinical and preclinical data in various tumor types indicate that PIK3CA activating alterations may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting PI3K (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574, Juric et al., 2018; 29401002, Gallant et al., 2019; 30793038, Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23, Delestre et al., 2021; 34613809, Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Santin et al., 2020; 31934607, Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871), AKT (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Smyth et al., 2021; 33863913), or mTOR (Varnier et al., 2019; 31351267, Basse et al., 2018; 32914004, Sultova et al., 2021; 33277683, Mackay et al., 2014; 24166148, Myers et al., 2016; 27016228, Dhami et al., 2018; 29588307, Harris et al., 2019; 30863722, Hanna et al., 2018; 29301825). A Phase 2 study of buparlisib in NSCLC observed 2 PRs (3.2%; 2/63) in PIK3CA_pathway activated tumors, although the study did not meet its primary endpoint (Vansteenkiste et al., 2015; 26098748). The Phase 2 NCI_MATCH study of copanlisib for patients with refractory solid tumors harboring PIK3CA mutations with or without PTEN loss met its primary endpoint with an ORR of 16% (4/25 PRs); responses (PR or SD >6 months) were seen in patients with ameloblastoma, liposarcoma, and carcinomas of the endometrium, ovary, esophagus, lung, and prostate (Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871). However, the Phase 2 study of copanlisib for patients with endometrial carcinoma harboring PIK3CA hotspot mutations failed to report any objective responses (n=11)(Santin et al., 2020; 31934607). Two other studies of copanlisib for patients with genomically unselected tumors reported 1 CR and 2 PRs (1 unconfirmed) among 16 total patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors with or without PTEN alterations (Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PIK3CA activating mutations may lead to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may therefore indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI_H is generally infrequent in NSCLC, reported in fewer than 1% of samples across several large studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197, Ninomiya et al., 2006; 16641899, Vanderwalde et al., 2018; 29436178, Zang et al., 2019; 31270941, Dudley et al., 2016; 26880610, Takamochi et al., 2017; 28676214, Schrock et al., 2017; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2016.11.487), whereas data on the reported incidence of MSI_H in SCLC has been limited and conflicting (Pylkkanen et al., 1997; 9329646, Gonzalez et al., 2000; 11061602, Chen et al., 1996; 8782463, Merlo et al., 1994; 8174113). One study reported MSI_H in lung adenocarcinoma patients with smoking history, and 3 of 4 MSI_H patients examined also had metachronous carcinomas in other organs, although this has not been investigated in large scale studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197).

TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). Elevated TMB has been reported to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors in multiple solid tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). However, the TMB level in this sample could not be determined with confidence. A large_scale genomic analysis found that unspecified lung non_small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), lung adenocarcinoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) samples harbored median TMBs between 6.3 and 9 Muts/Mb, and 12% to 17% of cases had an elevated TMB of greater than 20 Muts/Mb (FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). Lower TMB is observed more commonly in NSCLCs harboring known driver mutations (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, or MET) with the exception of BRAF or KRAS mutations, which are commonly observed in elevated TMB cases (Spigel et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9017). Although some studies have reported a lack of association between smoking and mutational burden in NSCLC (Schwartz et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 8533, Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843, Shim et al., 2015; 26200269), several other large studies did find a strong association with increased TMB (Govindan et al., 2012; 22980976, Ding et al., 2008; 18948947, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Kim et al., 2014; 24323028). TMB >10 muts/Mb was found to be more frequent in NSCLC metastases compared with primary tumors for both adenocarcinoma (38% vs. 25%) and SCC (41% vs. 35%) subtypes (Stein et al., 2019; DOI: 10.1200/PO.18.00376). A meta_analysis of 19 studies of immune checkpoint inhibitor_treated NSCLC (n = 2,315 patients) demonstrated that high TMB predicted a significantly longer OS than low TMB (HR = 0.70), and within the high TMB group, immunotherapy was associated with an improved PFS (HR = 0.62, P<0.001), OS (HR = 0.67, P<0.001) and a higher response rate (OR = 2.35, P<0.001) compared to chemotherapy (Meng et al., 2022; 35113949). In contrast, a large study of Chinese patients with untreated lung adenocarcinoma reported a shorter median OS for tumors with a higher number of mutations in a limited gene set compared with a lower mutation number (48.4 vs. 61.0 months)(Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843). Another study of patients with NSCLC treated with EGFR inhibitors or platinum doublet chemotherapy found elevated TMB to be correlated with poorer prognosis, as well as finding lower TMB in combination with PD_L1 negative status to be significantly associated with longer median survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). However, no significant prognostic association of TMB and/or PD_L1 status with survival has been reported in patients with lung SCC (Yu et al., 2019; 30253973, Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). Multiple clinical trials of PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors or combination of PD_1 and CTLA_4 inhibitors in NSCLC have reported that patients with tumors harboring TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb derive greater clinical benefit from these therapies than those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb (based on this assay or others); similarly, higher efficacy of anti_PD_1 or anti_PD_L1 immunotherapy for treatment of patients with NSCLC, compared with the use of chemotherapy, has been observed more significantly in cases of TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (based on this assay or others); (Spigel et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9017, Hellmann et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT077, Ramalingam et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT078, Kowanetz et al., 2016; ESMO Abstract 77P, Gandara et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 12950, Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Velcheti et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12001, Herbst et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA79, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT07, Castellanos et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 2630, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Colli et al., 2016; 27197178, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Wang et al., 2017; 28923100, Carbone et al., 2017; 28636851, Rizvi et al., 2018; 29337640, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Forde et al., 2018; 29658848, Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Miao et al., 2018; 30150660, Chae et al., 2019; 30425022). Improved OS of patients with NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy relative to chemotherapy only (Paz_Ares et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA80), or those treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab also relative to chemotherapy (Hellmann et al., 2019; 31562796), has been observed across all TMB levels.
