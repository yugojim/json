Activating mutations in RAS genes can cause uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor formation (Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Kahn et al., 1987; 3310850). KRAS alterations affecting amino acids G12, G13, Q22, P34, A59, Q61, and A146, as well as mutations G10_A11insG, G10_A11insAG (also reported as G10_A11dup and G12_G13insAG), A18D, L19F, D33E, G60_A66dup/E62_A66dup, E62K, E63K, R68S, and K117N have been characterized as activating and oncogenic (Akagi et al., 2007; 17150185, Bollag et al., 1996; 8955068, Buhrman et al., 2010; 20194776, Colicelli, 2004; 15367757, Edkins et al., 2006; 16969076, Feig and Cooper, 1988; 3043178, Gremer et al., 2011; 20949621, Janakiraman et al., 2010; 20570890, Kim et al., 2016; 27147599, Lukman et al., 2010; 20838576, Naguib et al., 2011; 21371307, Prior et al., 2012; 22589270, Priv\u00e9 et al., 1992; 1565661, Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Scheffzek et al., 1997; 9219684, Scholl et al., 2009; 19490892, Smith et al., 2010; 20147967, Tyner et al., 2009; 19075190, Valencia et al., 1991; 2029511, White et al., 2016; 26854029, Wiest et al., 1994; 8058307, Kim et al., 2016; 27147599, Angeles et al., 2019; 31289513, Tong et al., 2014; 24642870, Loree et al., 2021; 34117033). Mutations in KRAS have been reported in approximately 35_50% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) (Lievre et al., 2006; 16618717, De Roock et al., 2011; 21163703, Chen et al., 2014; 25367198, Li et al., 2015; 25929517, Hu et al., 2016; 27977612, Zekri et al., 2017; 28218784, Staudacher et al., 2017; 29048416, Wang et al., 2018; 29705968, Guo et al., 2018; 29666387). Numerous studies have reported that KRAS mutations are associated with increased metastasis, adverse clinicopathological features, and shorter survival of patients with CRC (Chen et al., 2014; 25367198, Li et al., 2015; 25929517, Hu et al., 2016; 27977612, M\u00e1rmol et al., 2017; 28106826, Zekri et al., 2017; 28218784, Kwak et al., 2017; 28858102). Preclinical evidence suggests that KRAS activation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, such as trametinib, binimetinib, cobimetinib, and selumetinib (Nakano et al., 1984; 6320174, Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Yamaguchi et al., 2011; 21523318, Watanabe et al., 2013; 23438367, Gilmartin et al., 2011; 21245089, Yeh et al., 2009; 19372556). However, multiple clinical trials have reported lack of efficacy of trametinib and other MEK inhibitors when used as monotherapy for treatment of patients with KRAS_mutant CRC (Tsimberidou et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract e22086)(Infante et al., 2012; 22805291, Zimmer et al., 2014; 24947927, Bennouna et al., 2011; 20127139, Weekes et al., 2013; 23434733). Both clinical (Hochster et al., 2013; ASCO GI Abstract 380, Juric et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 9051) and preclinical (Lamba et al., 2014; 25199829, Sun et al, 2014; 24685132) studies suggest that combinatorial approaches including MEK inhibitors are likely to be more effective for the treatment of CRC, including strategies such as combination of MEK inhibitors with PI3K inhibitors (Juric et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 9051), RAF inhibitors (Lamba et al., 2014; 25199829), pan_ERBB inhibitors (Sun et al, 2014; 24685132), or chemotherapeutic agents (Hochster et al., 2013; ASCO GI Abstract 380). In a Phase 1 study evaluating the MEK_pan_RAF dual inhibitor CH5126766, 6 patients harboring KRAS mutations experienced PRs, including 3 with non_small cell lung cancer (NCSLC), 1 with low_grade serous ovarian carcinoma (LGSOC), 1 with endometrial adenocarcinoma, and 1 with multiple myeloma (Guo et al., 2020; 33128873). Combination of CH5126766 with the FAK inhibitor defactinib elicited PR rates of 50% (4/8) for patients with KRAS_mutated low_grade serous ovarian cancer and 12% (2/17) for patients with KRAS_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a Phase 1 study (Krebs et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT019, Shinde et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT143). Preclinical and clinical data suggest that KRAS mutations may predict clinical benefit from SHP2 inhibitors (Lu et al., 2019; 31068384, Mainardi et al., 2018; 29808006, Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001, Brana et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3005, Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). A Phase 1 study of RMC_4630 for relapsed/refractory solid tumors reported a DCR of 58% (23/40) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS mutations and a DCR of 75% (12/16) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS G12C mutations (Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001). Interim results from a Phase 1/2 study of RMC_4630 plus cobimetinib reported tumor reduction in 3 of 8 patients with KRAS_mutated colorectal cancer (Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). Preclinical data suggest that KRAS mutation may confer sensitivity to SOS1 inhibitors (Hillig et al., 2019; 30683722, Hofmann et al., 2021; 32816843, Gerlach et al., 2020; AACR Abstract 1091). Phase 1 studies of the SOS1 inhibitor BI 1701963 alone or in combination with MEK inhibitors, KRAS G12C inhibitors, or irinotecan are recruiting for patients with solid tumors harboring KRAS mutations (Hofmann et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT210, Gort et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract TPS3651). Preclinical and limited clinical evidence suggest that KRAS mutation may predict sensitivity to PLK1 inhibitors (Luo et al., 2009; 19490893, Lenz et al., 2020; ASCO GI Abstract TPS265). A Phase 1b/2 study of PLK1 inhibitor onvansertib in combination with FOLFIRI and bevacizumab for patients with KRAS_mutated metastatic CRC previously treated with chemotherapy reported an 87.5% (7/8; 3 PR, 4 SD) clinical benefit rate, with 1 patient going on to successful curative surgery (Barzi et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT235). Activating mutations in KRAS or NRAS are associated with lack of clinical benefit from cetuximab (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Bokemeyer et al., 2011; 21228335, Karapetis et al., 2008; 18946061, De Roock et al., 2008; 17998284) or panitumumab (Douillard et al., 2014; 24718886, Douillard et al., 2012; 24024839, Amado et al., 2008; 18316791) for patients with CRC.

RNF43 and the homologous E3 ubiquitin ligase ZNRF3 are tumor suppressors that function as negative regulators of WNT signaling (Hao et al., 2012; 22575959, Koo et al., 2012; 22895187, Jiang et al., 2013; 23847203, Koo et al., 2015; 26023187, Tsukiyama et al., 2015; 25825523). An additional tumor_suppressor_like role for RNF43 in colon cancer is hypothesized to occur via its interaction with the ubiquitin_protein ligase NEDL1, which is predicted to enhance the pro_apoptotic effects of p53 (Shinada et al., 2011; 21108931). Mutations in RNF43 have been reported in 18_27% of endometrial cancers (Kinde et al., 2013; 23303603, Giannakis et al., 2014; 25344691), 3_5% of pancreatic cancers (Madan and Virshup, 2015; 25901018), 21% of ovarian mucinous carcinomas (Ryland et al., 2013; 23096461), 9% of liver fluke_associated cholangiocarcinomas (Ong et al., 2012; 22561520), and up to 18% of colorectal cancers (Giannakis et al., 2014; 25344691, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696).

KEAP1 exerts anti_tumor effects through negative regulation of NRF2, a transcription factor encoded by NFE2L2 (Wakabayashi et al., 2003; 14517554, Kansanen et al., 2013; 24024136, Hast et al., 2013; 23382044); KEAP1 inactivation promotes cancer progression through NRF2_mediated chemoresistance and cell growth (Kansanen et al., 2013; 24024136, Hast et al., 2013; 23382044). Somatic mutation of KEAP1 occurs in a range of solid tumors, including gastric, hepatocellular, colorectal, and lung cancers (Yoo et al., 2012; 22348534). KEAP1 mutations are rare in hematological malignancies, occurring in fewer than 1% of samples analyzed (COSMIC, 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). In a retrospective analysis of the pan_solid MSKCC dataset, KEAP1 mutation correlated with reduced OS (13.28 vs. 26.53 months) (Xu et al., 2020; 32272498). A study of patients with localized non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) identified pathogenic KEAP1 and NFE2L2 mutations as predictors of local recurrence following radiotherapy but not surgery; limited preclinical data also showed that treatment with a glutaminase inhibitor sensitized KEAP1_mutated NSCLC cells to radiation (Binkley et al., 2020; 33071215). In other preclinical studies, treatment with AKT inhibitors sensitized lung cancer cells harboring KEAP1 or NFE2L2 mutations to both chemotherapy and radiation therapy (Chowdhry et al., 2013; 22964642, Abazeed et al., 2013; 23980093). Mixed clinical data have been reported for the association between KEAP1 mutations and the response to immunotherapy. A pan_cancer study of immunotherapy showed that patients with KEAP1 mutations had shorter OS (10 vs. 20 months) than those without (Chen et al., 2020; 32175433). However, another study across solid tumors showed that KEAP1 mutations were associated with higher tumor mutational burden (TMB) and PD_L1 expression, as well as improved survival outcomes with immunotherapy compared with other treatments (20.0 vs. 11.5 months) (Xu et al., 2020; 32272498). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a study of PD_L1 inhibitors showed that patients with concurrent mutations of STK11 and KEAP1 (n=39) experienced significantly shorter PFS (1.6 vs. 2.5 months, HR=1.5) and OS (4 vs. 11 months, HR=1.9) compared with patients with STK11_ and KEAP1_wildtype tumors (n=210) despite significantly higher TMB in the group harboring STK11 and KEAP1 mutations (median 9.4 vs. 6.1 Muts/Mb) (Arbour et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract MA19.09). Retrospective analyses of patients with NSCLC who received immunotherapy reported reduced OS (p=0.040) for patients harboring KEAP1_ or NFE2L2_mutated tumors (Zhang et al., 2020; 32471565) or STK11_ or KEAP1_mutated tumors (p <0.001) (Shang et al., 2020; WCLC Abstract P75.02) compared with those without. Studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with lung adenocarcinoma showed that coexisting mutations between KEAP1, PBRM1, SMARCA4, STK11, and KRAS were associated with worse OS (Marinelli et al., 2020; 32866624, Ricciuti et al., 2020; WCLC Abstract P14.26). An exploratory analysis of a subset of patients with PD_L1_positive NSCLC treated in the first_line setting with pembrolizumab showed similar ORR, PFS, and OS when comparing patients with STK11 or KEAP1 mutations and those without (Cho et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT084). In addition, preclinical data suggest that KEAP1 inactivation increases tumor demand for glutamine and increases tumor sensitivity to glutaminase inhibitors like telaglenastat (Gwinn et al., 2018; 29316436, Sayin et al., 2017; 28967864, Romero et al., 2017; 28967920). Limited clinical data suggest that KEAP1 mutations may predict improved clinical benefit from combinations of glutaminase inhibitors and anti_PD_1 inhibitors (Skoulidis et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract TPS9627); a Phase 1/2 study of the glutaminase inhibitor telaglenastat (CB_839) plus nivolumab to treat advanced NSCLC reported better clinical benefit rates and median PFS for patients with KEAP1 mutations (75% [3/4] vs. 15% [2/13], 6.4 vs. 3.7 months), KRAS mutations (38% [3/8] vs. 20% [2/10], 4.5 vs. 3.7 months), or KEAP1 and KRAS concurrent mutations (100% [2/2] vs. 13% [1/8], 7.2 vs. 3.7 months) compared with patients without these mutations (Skoulidis et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract TPS9627). The KEAP1 mutation has also been identified as a potential biomarker for sensitivity to combined AKT and TXNRD1 inhibition in lung cancer (Dai et al., 2013; 23824739).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS colorectal cancers (CRCs) make up 70_85% of CRC cases (Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894). MSS colorectal cancers are molecularly heterogeneous, driven by diverse mechanisms such as extensive DNA methylation, oncogenic mutations in KRAS or BRAF, or chromosomal instability (Jass, 2007; 17204026). Multiple studies have shown that MSS CRCs have a worse prognosis than MSI_high tumors (Samowitz et al., 2001; 11535541, Elsaleh and Iacopetta, 2001; 12445368, Brueckl et al., 2003; 12820457, Guidoboni et al., 2001; 11438476, Gryfe et al., 2000; 10631274, Sinicrope et al., 2006; 16952542, Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Laghi and Malesci, 2012; 22722556). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60). For patients with chemotherapy_refractory microsatellite_stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), a Phase 3 trial reported no OS advantage from the combination of the PD_L1 inhibitor atezolizumab plus cobimetinib relative to regorafenib (8.9 vs. 8.5 months, HR=1.00); atezolizumab monotherapy similarly did not prolong OS (7.1 vs. 8.5 months, HR=1.19) (Ciardiello et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract LBA_004). For patients with MSS CRC, a Phase 2 study combining ipilimumab and nivolumab reported an overall DCR of 25% (10/40) (Parikh et al., 2021; DOI: 10.1038/s43018_021_00269_7). Two Phase 1 studies for patients with MSS CRC treated with regorafenib and nivolumab reported PFSs of 7.9 months (Fukuoka et al., 2020; 32343640) and 5.7 months (Kim et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1016/j.annonc.2020.04.073), and a patient with MSS CRC refractory to chemotherapy treated with the PD_1 inhibitor sintilimab and regorafenib reported a CR (Zhang et al., 2021; 34688262). MSI has not been found to be a predictive biomarker for combination chemotherapy regimens, including FOLFOX (Sinicrope et al., 2013; 24019539, Gavin et al., 2012; 23045248) and FOLFIRI (Bertagnolli et al., 2009; 19273709, Van Cutsem et al., 2009; 19451425). Patients with MSS CRC are more likely to benefit from postsurgical fluorouracil (FU)_based adjuvant therapy (Ribic et al., 2003; 12867608, Sargent et al., 2010; 20498393) but less likely to benefit from irinotecan chemotherapy (Fallik et al., 2003; 14522894).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "NRAS", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "wildtype", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "wildtype"}}, "Interpretation": "NRAS encodes a member of the RAS family of small GTPases that mediate transduction of growth signals.

No alterations in NRAS were identified in this case. The majority of colorectal cancers (CRCs) (91_98%) have been reported to lack NRAS mutations (Pentheroudakis et al., 2013; 23374602, Vaughn et al., 2011; 21305640, Janku et al., 2013; 23400451, De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739, Irahara et al., 2010; 20736745, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Schirripa et al., 2015; 24806288, Guo et al., 2018; 29666387).

Other clinical studies in pancreatic cancer have reported an association of high SMAD4 expression with better responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Kassardjian and Wang, 2020; 32897998) and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (Pen et al., 2021; 33667587). Germline SMAD4 mutations, including those at the R361 hotspot, have been observed in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome (Houlston et al., 1998; 9811934, Woodford_Richens et al., 2000; 10764709, Howe et al., 2004; 15235019, Howe et al., 2004; 15235019, Howe et al., 2004; 15235019), which is associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal cancers (Brosens et al., 2011; 22171123). The penetrance of deleterious SMAD4 mutations in patients with colon cancer is estimated at 20% by age 35 and 70% by age 65 (Kalia et al., 2017; 27854360). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of SMAD4 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TET2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "E1151*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "E1151*"}}, "Interpretation": "TET2 encodes a tumor suppressor involved in reversing DNA methylation marks, a process critical for proper gene regulation (Ito et al., 2010; 20639862, Guo et al., 2011; 21496894). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TET2 function or expression (Iyer et al., 2009; 19411852, Ko et al., 2010; 21057493, Yang et al., 2013; 22391558, Hu et al., 2013; 24315485, Wang et al., 2015; 25601757). TET2 alterations have been reported at relatively low frequencies in solid tumors and are more prevalent in hematological malignancies (cBioPortal, Jan 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of TET2 alterations in solid tumors are limited (PubMed, Jan 2022). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in TET2 in solid tumors. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "L252_I254del", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "L252_I254del"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 mutations have been reported in up to 75% of colorectal cancer cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Goh et al., 1995; 7585578, Berg et al., 2010; 21103049, Han et al., 2013; 23700467, Peeters et al., 2013; 23325582, Malhotra et al., 2013; 23526092, Di Bartolomeo et al., 2013; 23821376, Fong et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 57). A study reported p53 expression in 49% of analyzed colorectal cancer cases (Wangefjord et al., 2013; 23337059). TP53 mutation has not been consistently demonstrated to be a significant independent prognostic marker in the context of CRC (Russo et al., 2005; 16172461, Fong et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 57). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Fabrizio et al., 2018; 30151257, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526). Elevated tumor mutational burden (TMB) has been reported in 8_25% of colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (George et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3587, Nagahashi et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e15103, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117, Shao et al., 2020; 33119110). Multiple studies have reported that up to 90% of hypermutated CRC cases exhibit high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI_H) and mismatch repair deficiency (MMR_D) (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). Increased TMB is significantly associated with MSI_H and MMR_D, with studies reporting that 100% of MSI_H CRCs harbor elevated TMB and conversely that 100% of tumors with low TMB harbor intact MMR (George et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3587, Nagahashi et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e15103, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). A subset of CRCs that harbor increased TMB but not MSI_H are driven by mutations in POLE, which leads to an \u201cultramutated\u201d phenotype with especially high TMB (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). Tumors with increased TMB harbor BRAF V600E mutations more frequently than those with low TMB (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117), whereas TMB_low tumors more frequently harbor mutations in TP53 and APC (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696). The prognostic value of tumor mutational burden (TMB) in colorectal cancer (CRC) is context_ and therapy_dependent. A study of tissue TMB (tTMB) in 145 CRC samples showed longer OS in TMB_high samples compared with TMB_low ones (Schwartz et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 572). Similarly, for patients with metastatic CRC treated with first_line chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab or cetuximab, high tissue TMB (tTMB_H) was associated with longer OS (Innocenti et al., 2019; 30865548). For patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, tTMB_H was associated with better 5_year relapse_free survival (Lee et al., 2019; 31285374). However, for patients with EGFR/BRAF_inhibitor_treated, BRAF_mutated microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic CRC, intermediate tTMB was associated with significantly poorer PFS and OS compared with TMB_low status; patients with primary resistance to EGFR/BRAF blockage had higher TMB than those sensitive to these therapies (Randon et al., 2022; 34933155). In a study for 61 patients with metastatic, MSS CRC treated with best standard of care, plasma TMB scores \u226528 Muts/Mb (approximately 14 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) were associated with reduced OS compared with plasma TMB scores <28 Muts/Mb (3.0 vs. 5.3 months, HR=0.76, p=0.007), whereas tTMB was not found to be prognostic in this population (Chen et al., 2020; 32379280, Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, increased tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Ott et al., 2019; 30557521, Cristescu et al., 2022; 35101941, Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). In the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors, significant improvement in ORR was observed for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) compared with those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526); similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). At the same TMB cutpoint, retrospective analysis of patients with solid tumors treated with any checkpoint inhibitor identified that tissue TMB scores \u2265 10 Muts/Mb were associated with prolonged time to treatment failure compared with scores <10 muts/Mb (HR=0.68) (Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). For patients with solid tumors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the CheckMate 848 trial, improved responses were observed in patients with a tissue TMB \u2265 10 Muts/Mb independent of blood TMB at any cutpoint in matched samples (Schenker at al., 2022; AACR Abstract 7845). However, support for higher TMB thresholds and efficacy was observed in the prospective Phase 2 MyPathway trial of atezolizumab for patients with pan_solid tumors, where improved ORR and DCR was seen in patients with TMB \u2265 16 Muts/Mb than those with TMB \u2265 10 and <16 Muts/Mb (Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409). Similarly, analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386). In CRC specifically, a retrospective analysis of immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy reported significantly improved OS for patients with tumors harboring TMB \u22659.8 Muts/MB compared with those with tumors with TMB <9.8 Muts/Mb (~ equivalency <12 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254). Another retrospective study reported that a TMB \u226512 Muts/Mb cutoff identifies >99% of MSI_High CRC cases but only 3% of MSS cases, indicating the utility of this cutoff for identification of patients with CRC likely to benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Fabrizio et al., 2018; 30151257).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "KRAS", "Alteration": "G12D", "Title": "Trametinib Combined With Everolimus and Lenvatinib for Recurrent/Refractory Advanced Solid Tumors", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "mTOR, FGFRs, RET, PDGFRA, VEGFRs, KIT, MEK", "Locations": "Guangzhou (China)", "NCTID": "NCT04803318", "Note": "KRAS activating mutations or amplification may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of MAPK pathway components, including MEK inhibitors.
