Mutation, loss, or inactivation of ARID1A has been reported in many cancers, and the gene is considered a tumor suppressor (Guan et al., 2011; 21900401, Jones et al., 2012; 22009941, Wiegand et al., 2010; 20942669, Jones et al., 2010; 20826764, Yan et al., 2014; 24293408, Wang et al., 2012; 22808142, Huang et al., 2012; 22922871, Chan_On et al., 2013; 24185513, Mamo et al., 2012; 21892209). ARID1A mutations, which are mostly truncating, have been identified along the entire gene and often correlate with ARID1A protein loss (Jones et al., 2012; 22009941, Wiegand et al., 2010; 20942669, Jones et al., 2010; 20826764, Zang et al., 2012; 22484628, Wang et al., 2011; 22037554), whereas ARID1A missense mutations are mostly uncharacterized. ARID1A alterations are particularly prevalent in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (46_50%), ovarian and uterine endometrioid carcinomas (24_44%), and cholangiocarcinoma (27%); they are also reported in up to 27% of gastric carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, pediatric Burkitt lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, and urothelial carcinoma samples analyzed (COSMIC, cBioPortal, 2021) (Tate et al., 2019; 30371878, Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Wu et al., 2014; 24618703, Jones et al., 2012; 22009941, Dulak et al., 2013; 23525077, Streppel et al., 2013; 23318448, Jiao et al., 2014; 24293293, Ross et al., 2014; 24563076). ARID1A loss is associated with microsatellite instability in ovarian and endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinomas (Huang et al., 2014; 25195947, Hussein et al., 2014; 25394778, Bosse et al., 2013; 23702729, Allo et al., 2014; 23887303, Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729), CRC (Chou et al., 2014; 24925223, Ye et al., 2014; 25311944, Wei et al., 2014; 25561809, Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729), and gastric cancer (Chen et al., 2015; 25583476, Wang et al., 2011; 22037554, Abe et al., 2012; 22915242, Wang et al., 2012; 22808142, Wiegand et al., 2014; 24767857, Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729). ARID1A protein loss is associated with tumors of poor histological grade for many tumor types, including colorectal cancer (CRC) (Chou et al., 2014; 24925223, Ye et al., 2014; 25311944, Wei et al., 2014; 25561809), cervical cancer (Katagiri et al., 2012; 22274316, Cho et al., 2013; 23427874), gastric cancer (Chen et al., 2015; 25583476, Wang et al., 2011; 22037554, Abe et al., 2012; 22915242, Wang et al., 2012; 22808142, Wiegand et al., 2014; 24767857), urothelial carcinoma (Gui et al., 2011; 21822268, Balbas_Martinez et al., 2013; 23650517, Faraj et al., 2014; 25175170), ovarian and endometrial cancers (Rahman et al., 2013; 22939958, Maeda et al., 2010; 21614196, Lowery et al., 2012; 22193641, Fadare et al., 2013; 23524907, Mao et al., 2013; 24076775, Katagiri et al., 2012; 22101352, Huang et al., 2014; 25195947, Hussein et al., 2014; 25394778, Bosse et al., 2013; 23702729, Allo et al., 2014; 23887303), breast carcinoma (Zhang et al., 2012; 21889920, Mamo et al., 2012; 21892209, Zhao et al., 2014; 24430365), and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (Lichner et al., 2013; 23416164); ARID1A mutation has been associated with poor outcomes for patients with cholangiocarcinoma (Feng et al., 2021; 33387086, Conci et al., 2020; 32020551, Simbolo et al., 2018; 29740198, Ruzzenente et al., 2016; 26717940). However, prognostic data regarding patient survival are often mixed and conflicting. There are no therapies approved to address the mutation or loss of ARID1A in cancer. However, on the basis of limited clinical and preclinical evidence, ARID1A inactivating mutations may lead to sensitivity to ATR inhibitors such as M6620 and ceralasertib (Williamson et al., 2016; 27958275). In a Phase 2 study of ceralasertib in solid tumors, 2 patients with endometrial carcinoma in the cohort with loss of ARID1A expression achieved CRs on ceralasertib monotherapy; at least 1 of these 2 patients carried an inactivating ARID1A mutation. In contrast, no responses were observed for patients with normal ARID1A expression treated with ceralasertib combined with olaparib (Aggarwal et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 512O). One patient with small cell lung cancer harboring an ARID1A mutation experienced a PR when treated with M6620 combined with topotecan (Thomas et al., 2018; 29252124). In a Phase 1 trial, a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer harboring both an ARID1A mutation and ATM loss treated with single_agent M6620 achieved a CR that was ongoing at 29 months (Yap et al., 2020; 32568634). On the basis of limited preclinical evidence from studies in ovarian cancer, ARID1A inactivation may predict sensitivity to EZH2 inhibitors (Bitler et al., 2015; 25686104, Kim et al., 2015; 26552009), which are under investigation in clinical trials. Other studies have reported that the loss of ARID1A may activate the PI3K_AKT pathway and be linked with sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway (Wiegand et al., 2014; 24559118, Huang et al., 2014; 24336158, Samartzis et al., 2014; 24979463). Patients with ARID1A alterations in advanced or metastatic solid tumors may derive benefit from treatment with anti_PD_1 or anti_PD_L1 immunotherapy (Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729). Loss of ARID1A expression has been associated with chemoresistance to platinum_based therapy for patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma (Yokoyama et al., 2014; 24459582, Katagiri et al., 2012; 22101352) and to 5_fluorouracil in colorectal cancer cell lines (Xie et al., 2014; 24833095).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "ARID1A loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to ATR inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT02264678", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02630199", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04266912", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04497116", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04514497", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03641547", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03669601", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02595931", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "PIK3CA", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "H1047L", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "H1047L"}}, "Interpretation": "PIK3CA encodes p110_alpha, which is the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3_kinase (PI3K). The PI3K pathway is involved in cell signaling that regulates a number of critical cellular functions, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival (Samuels et al., 2005; 15950905, Engelman, 2009; 19629070). PIK3CA alterations that have been characterized as activating, such as observed here, are predicted to be oncogenic (Kang et al., 2005; 15647370, Ikenoue et al., 2005; 15930273, Gymnopoulos et al., 2007; 17376864, Horn et al., 2008; 18317450, Rudd et al., 2011; 21266528, Hon et al., 2012; 22120714, Burke et al., 2012; 22949682, Wu et al., 2009; 19915146, Dbouk et al., 2010; 2103068, Dan et al., 2010; 20530683, Oda et al., 2008; 18829572, Zhao and Vogt, 2008; 18794883, Lui et al., 2013; 23619167, Ross et al., 2013; 22430209, Riviere et al., 2012; 22729224, Shibata et al., 2009; 19394761, Droguluk et al., 2015; 26627007,Croessmann et al., 2018; 29284706, Ng et al., 2018; 29533785, Spangle et al., 2020; 32929011, Chen et al., 2018; 29636477). PI3K pathway alterations are frequent in gynecologic carcinosarcomas and have been reported in greater than half of all cases in one study (Jones et al., 2014; 25233892). PIK3CA mutations have been reported in 19_41% of gynecologic carcinosarcomas (Jones et al., 2014; 25233892, Growdon et al., 2011; 21168197) and 8% of endometrial carcinosarcoma (Biscuola et al., 2013; 23199529). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of PIK3CA alterations in uterine carcinosarcoma are limited (PubMed, Jul 2021). Clinical and preclinical data in various tumor types indicate that PIK3CA activating alterations may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting PI3K (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574, Juric et al., 2018; 29401002, Gallant et al., 2019; 30793038), AKT (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Smyth et al., 2021; 33863913), or mTOR (Park et al., 2016; 27105424, Lim et al., 2016; 26859683, Hou et al., 2014; 25426553, Varnier et al., 2019; 31351267, Janku et al., 2014; 24440717, Moroney et al., 2012; 22927482, Basho et al., 2017; 27893038, Moroney et al., 2011; 21890452). In the Phase 2 MATCH trial for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors, 28% (18/65) of patients experienced PFS lasting at least 6 months after treatment with taselisib; however, no ORs were observed in this study (Krop et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 101). A separate Phase 1b study of taselisib in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors reported an ORR of 0% (n=12) and a DCR of 17% (2/12) (Pascual et al., 2021; 32958578). In a Phase 1 trial of the dual PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitor apitolisib, 79% (11/14) of patients with PIK3CA_mutated advanced solid tumors experienced disease control (3 PRs, 8 SDs) (Dolly et al., 2016; 26787751). The PI3K inhibitor alpelisib demonstrated an ORR of 6.0% (8/134) and a DCR of 58% (78/134) in a study for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors (Juric et al., 2018; 2941002). However, the PI3K inhibitor copanlisib exhibited limited efficacy in PIK3CA_mutated tumors (Santin et al., 2020; 31934607, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PIK3CA activating mutations may lead to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may therefore indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.

In a Phase 1 study of everolimus in combination with sorafenib, of the 22 enrolled patients with advanced solid tumors, the best response was SD lasting 168 days in a patient with uterine carcinosarcoma (Ma et al., 2012; ESMO Congress Abstract 447PD). A patient with a mixed Mullerian tumor exhibited a PR in a Phase 1 trial of a rapamycin analog, deforolimus (Mita et al., 2008; 18202410). A study of the mTOR inhibitor ridaforolimus as a single agent reported no clinical response in 5 patients with uterine carcinosarcoma (Colombo et al., 2013; 23403817). In a Phase 2 clinical trial of recurrent endometrial cancer, 43% (12/28) of patients reported SD at 8 weeks and 21% (6/28) of patients achieved clinical benefit at 20 weeks upon administration of everolimus monotherapy (Slomovitz et al., 2010; 20681032). Combination with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole for the same disease population achieved an ORR of 31% (11/35), with 9 CRs (Slomovitz et al., 2015; 25624430). Further addition of metformin to this regimen led to a clinical benefit rate (CR+PR+SD) of 67% (32/48), including PR in 29% (14/48) of cases; no significant difference was observed between cases with and without KRAS mutation (Soliman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5506). Everolimus achieved PR or SD in 35% of patients with recurrent endometrial carcinoma; KRAS mutation was associated with reduced median PFS (3.1 vs. 1.0 months) and median OS (9.3 vs. 2.3 months) (Tredan et al., 2012; 23238879). Another study investigating estrogen and/or progesterone receptor_positive gynecologic or breast malignancies featuring mutation or loss of genes in the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway, including PIK3CA, AKT1, or PTEN, observed SD in 17% (1/6) of patients with endometrial cancer following combined treatment with everolimus and anastrozole (Wheler et al., 2014; 24912489).

PTEN alterations have been reported in 12.9% of endometrial carcinosarcomas and 6.7% (3/45) of ovarian carcinosarcoma cases analyzed in COSMIC (Apr 2021)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). PTEN mutations have been reported in up to 40% of uterine carcinosarcomas in the literature (Cherniack et al., 2017; 28292439 , Lu et al., 2019; 30359167). A study of gynecological carcinosarcomas, including 17 uterine cases and 5 ovarian cases, identified alterations activating the PI3K pathway in over half of the samples analyzed, including PTEN mutations in 41% (9/22) of cases (Jones et al., 2014; 25233892). PTEN mutation has been associated with endometrioid_type but not serous_type uterine carcinosarcomas in multiple studies (Amant et al., 2002; 11925138, McConechy et al., 2012; 22653804, Zhao et al., 2016; 27791010). Loss of PTEN expression has been reported in 39% (12/31) of primary uterine carcinosarcomas, and specifically in 64% (20/37) of the epithelial component and 47% (17/33) of the mesenchymal component (de Jong et al., 2011; 21572397). In addition, loss of PTEN expression has also been found in 53% (10/17) of the epithelial component of metastatic tissue of uterine carcinosarcomas, but not in any of the five mesenchymal components studied (de Jong et al., 2011; 21572397). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of PTEN alteration in carcinosarcomas are limited (PubMed, Apr 2021). PTEN loss or mutation leads to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway (Courtney et al., 2010; 20085938, Simpson and Parsons, 2001; 11237521, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Milella et al., 2017; 28220839). Across various tissues, most clinical studies have not observed an association between PTEN deficiency and response to inhibitors of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway. However, limited studies in prostate cancer (Templeton et al., 2013; 23582881, Sweeney et al., 2021; 34246347, de Bono et al., 2019; 30037818, Saura et al., 2017; 27872130), renal cell carcinoma (Voss et al., 2019; 30327302), breast cancer (Andre et al., 2016; 27091708, Dent et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 1008, Schmid et al., 2020; 31841354), and colorectal cancer (Gilcrease et al., 2019; 30302599) have reported an association between PTEN deficiency and response to inhibitors targeting the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway. Preclinical data indicate that PTEN loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Mendes_Pereira et al., 2009; 20049735, Shen et al., 2013; 23881923, Chatterjee et al., 2013; 23565244, McCormick et al., 2016; 26905328, Forster et al., 2011; 21468130), and clinical benefit has been observed for patients with PTEN_altered breast cancer including triple negative breast cancer (Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006, Eikesdal et al., 2021; 33242536), ovarian cancer (Dougherty et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 5536), uterine leiomyosarcoma (Pan et al., 2021; 33970096), and endometrial cancer (Forster et al., 2011; 21468130) treated with PARP inhibitors. However, some studies have reported a lack of association between PTEN mutation and PARP inhibitor sensitivity (Sandhu et al., 2013; 23810788, Romero et al., 2020; 32988624, Piha_Paul et al., 2018; AACR Abstract A096). One or more of the PTEN variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with hamartoma tumor syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. PTEN mutations underlie several inherited disorders, collectively termed PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS), which include Cowden syndrome (CS) and its variant Lhermitte_Duclos disease (LD), Bannayan_Riley_Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), PTEN_related Proteus syndrome (PS), and Proteus_like syndrome (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191, Orloff and Eng, 2008; 18794875). The mutation rate for PTEN in these disorders ranges from 20 to 85% of patients (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191, Zbuk and Eng, 2007; 17167516). The estimated incidence of Cowden syndrome is 1/200,000, which may be an underestimate due to the high variability of this disorder (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191). Given the association between PTEN and these inherited syndromes, in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing for mutations affecting PTEN is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PTEN loss or inactivating mutations may lead to increased activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.

CTCF plays a role in transcriptional regulation of a number of key cancer_associated genes, including the oncogene MYC (Gombert and Krumm, 2009; 19568426) and tumor suppressor TP53 (Soto_Reyes and Recillas_Targa, 2010; 20101205), via maintenance of local DNA methylation status. The decreased expression levels of CTCF and/or BORIS, another 11_zinc_finger transcriptional regulator, were reported to be closely associated with global DNA methylation variability and decreased overall survival in epithelial ovarian cancer (Woloszynska_Read et al., 2011; 21296871, Kemp et al., 2014; 24794443). Somatic mutations in CTCF are infrequently reported in most cancers, but have been observed more commonly (24%) in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (cBioPortal, 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210); nearly half of the observed mutations were truncating, suggesting a tumor suppressor role for CTCF in this disease. In addition, CTCF has been found to act as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer cell line studies (M\u00e9ndez_Catal\u00e1 et al., 2013; 23908591, Tiffen et al., 2013; 23553099).

Germline de novo mutations of MLL2 are responsible for the majority of cases of Kabuki syndrome, a complex and phenotypically distinctive developmental disorder (Hannibal et al., 2011; 21671394). A significant number of inactivating MLL2 alterations have been observed in multiple tumor types, suggesting a tumor suppressor role (Fagan et al.,2019; 31128216). MLL2 alterations are observed in a number of solid tumor contexts (COSMIC, 2021)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878), and are especially prevalent in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2012; 22960745) and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) (Augert et al., 2017; 28007623). MLL2 mutation was found to be an independent prognostic factor of poor PFS and OS in non_small cell lung cancer, but not in SCLC (Ardeshir_Larijani et al., 2018; 29627316). One study reported that MLL2 truncating mutations were more common in recurrent ovary granulosa cell tumors (GCT) compared with primary GCTs (24% [10/42] vs. 3.0% [1/32])(Hillman et al., 2018; 29950560). In a study of esophageal SCC, high MLL2 expression positively correlated with tumor stage, differentiation, and size, and negatively correlated with OS (Abudureheman et al., 2018; 29532228). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in MLL2. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors may detect nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). In uterine carcinosarcoma, MSI at any level has been reported in 9.5% (2/21) of cases (Amant et al., 2001; 11437928), and high MSI (MSI_H) has been observed in 5% (1/21) to 21% (6/28) of cases (Amant et al., 2001; 11437928, Taylor et al., 2006; 16810312, Nilbert et al., 2009; 19130300, Gotoh et al., 2019; 31672974). MSS has been reported in 73_89% of endometrial cancers (Cancer Genome Research Atlas., 2013; 23636398, Black et al., 2006; 16549821, Mackay et al., 2010; 20304627, Kanopiene et al., 2014; 25458958, Hampel et al., 2006; 16885385, Steinbakk et al., 2011; 21547578, Bilbao et al., 2010; 20005452, Church et al., 2013; 23528559). A genomic profiling study of gynecologic carcinosarcoma (N=109) reported that MSI was predictive of improved PFS (HR=0.1937) and OS (HR=0.0937) in multivariate analysis (Gotoh et al., 2019; 31672974). Data regarding the role of MSI status on prognosis and survival in endometrial cancer are conflicting, with most studies finding no relationship between MSI_H endometrial cancers and survival (Zighelboim et al., 2007; 17513808, Kanopiene et al., 2014; 25458958, Bilbao_Sieyro et al., 2014; 25026289, Mackay et al., 2010; 20304627, Steinbakk et al., 2011; 21547578, Arabi et al., 2009; 19275958), and one study predicting improved disease_free and disease_specific survival (Black et al., 2006; 16549821). However, these studies often evaluated endometrial cancers of all FIGO stages together. Studies specifically analyzing early stage endometrial cancer have reported a correlation between MSI_H and decreased survival (Stelloo et al., 2016; 27006490, Mackay et al., 2010; 20304627, Nout et al., 2012; 22609107, Bilbao et al., 2010; 20005452), thereby suggesting that MSI_H predicts for poor prognosis in this subset of endometrial tumors. On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "00", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "00"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB level associated with lower rates of clinical benefit from treatment with PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors compared with patients with tumors harboring higher TMB levels, based on several studies in multiple solid tumor types (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). In one study of 22 gynecologic carcinosarcomas, the average mutation burden was 1.4 mutations/Mb; the four tumors with mutation in either MLH1 or MSH6 had the highest mutation burden in this study ranging from 29_191 mutations/Mb (cBio_Jones et al., 2014; 25233892). In the TCGA Uterine Corpus Endometrioid Carcinoma dataset, 7.3% of cases were ultramutated, 28% were hypermutated, and 65% of samples were considered to have a low mutation rate (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2013; 23636398). Another study evaluating TMB in endometrial adenocarcinomas reported that 24% of tumors had a mutational burden of 10.4_541 mut/Mb), whereas 76% had 0_10.3 mut/Mb (Santin et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5591). One study found TMB level was not significantly associated with OS for patients with uterine carcinosarcoma (Wu et al., 2019; DOI: 10.21037/atm.2019.10.116). Increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) in endometrial carcinoma has been correlated with POLE mutation and advanced high_grade endometrioid subtypes (Mehnert et al., 2016; 27159395, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Hussein et al., 2015; 25394778, Church et al., 2013; 23528559). Ultramutated endometrial tumors (elevated TMB with POLE mutations) have also been associated with improved PFS (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398). The same study associated lower mutational burden, independent of PD_L1 status, in endometrial carcinomas with poorer prognosis (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398). For patients with advanced microsatellite_stable endometrial carcinoma not treated with immunotherapy, OS did not significantly differ between patients with TMB_high (\u226510 Muts/Mb) and TMB_low (11.4 vs. 13.5 months, adjusted HR=1.15) in 1 study (Shao et al., 2020; 33119110). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, higher TMB has been reported to be associated with increased ORR and OS from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). Higher TMB was found to be significantly associated with improved OS upon immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment for patients with 9 types of advanced tumors (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254). Analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy, compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386). However, the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors found significant improvement in ORR for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (based on this assay or others) compared to those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb, in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types; similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). Together, these studies suggest that patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb may derive clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1 inhibitors.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "ARID1A", "Alteration": "T1649fs*49, Y762fs*1", "Title": "Ascending Doses of AZD6738 in Combination With Chemotherapy and/or Novel Anti Cancer Agents", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1/2", "Target": "ATR, PARP, PD_L1", "Locations": "Seongnam_si (Korea, Republic of), Seoul (Korea, Republic of), Cambridge (United Kingdom), Withington (United Kingdom), London (United Kingdom), Sutton (United Kingdom), Villejuif (France), Saint Herblain (France), California", "NCTID": "NCT02264678", "Note": "ARID1A loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to ATR inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "ARID1A", "Alteration": "T1649fs*49, Y762fs*1", "Title": "Study of AZD6738, DNA Damage Repair/Novel Anti_cancer Agent, in Combination With Paclitaxel, in Refractory Cancer", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "ATR", "Locations": "Seoul (Korea, Republic of)", "NCTID": "NCT02630199", "Note": "ARID1A loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to ATR inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "ARID1A", "Alteration": "T1649fs*49, Y762fs*1", "Title": "Avelumab and M6620 for the Treatment of DDR Deficient Metastatic or Unresectable Solid Tumors", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1/2", "Target": "ATR, PD_L1", "Locations": "Texas", "NCTID": "NCT04266912", "Note": "ARID1A loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to ATR inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "ARID1A", "Alteration": "T1649fs*49, Y762fs*1", "Title": "Study of RP_3500 in Advanced Solid Tumors", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1/2", "Target": "ATR, PARP", "Locations": "Copenhagen (Denmark), Newcastle Upon Tyne (United Kingdom), Manchester (United Kingdom), London (United Kingdom), Toronto (Canada), Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, Tennessee, Texas", "NCTID": "NCT04497116", "Note": "ARID1A loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to ATR inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "ARID1A", "Alteration": "T1649fs*49, Y762fs*1", "Title": "Testing the Addition of an Anti_cancer Drug, BAY 1895344, to Usual Chemotherapy for Advanced Stage Solid Tumors, With a Specific Focus on Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer, Poorly Differentiated Neuroendocrine Cancer, and Pancreatic Cancer", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "ATR, TOP1", "Locations": "Arizona, Oklahoma, Missouri, Connecticut, Tennessee", "NCTID": "NCT04514497", "Note": "ARID1A loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to ATR inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "ARID1A", "Alteration": "T1649fs*49, Y762fs*1", "Title": "M6620 Plus Standard Treatment in Oesophageal and Other Cancer", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "ATR", "Locations": "Glasgow (United Kingdom), Manchester (United Kingdom), Oxford (United Kingdom), Cardiff (United Kingdom)", "NCTID": "NCT03641547", "Note": "ARID1A loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to ATR inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "ARID1A", "Alteration": "T1649fs*49, Y762fs*1", "Title": "AZD6738 & Gemcitabine as Combination Therapy", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "ATR", "Locations": "Cambridge (United Kingdom)", "NCTID": "NCT03669601", "Note": "ARID1A loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to ATR inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "ARID1A", "Alteration": "T1649fs*49, Y762fs*1", "Title": "ATR Kinase Inhibitor VX_970 and Irinotecan Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors That Are Metastatic or Cannot Be Removed by Surgery", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "ATR", "Locations": "California, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Tennessee, Florida", "NCTID": "NCT02595931", "Note": "ARID1A loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to ATR inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "PIK3CA", "Alteration": "H1047L", "Title": "Tumor_Agnostic Precision Immuno_Oncology and Somatic Targeting Rational for You (TAPISTRY) Platform Study", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "ALK, ROS1, TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, RET, PD_L1, AKTs, ERBB2, MDM2, PI3K_alpha", "Locations": "Zhongzheng Dist.
