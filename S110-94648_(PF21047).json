Mutation, loss, or inactivation of ARID1A has been reported in many cancers, and the gene is considered a tumor suppressor (Guan et al., 2011; 21900401, Jones et al., 2012; 22009941, Wiegand et al., 2010; 20942669, Jones et al., 2010; 20826764, Yan et al., 2014; 24293408, Wang et al., 2012; 22808142, Huang et al., 2012; 22922871, Chan_On et al., 2013; 24185513, Mamo et al., 2012; 21892209). ARID1A mutations, which are mostly truncating, have been identified along the entire gene and often correlate with ARID1A protein loss (Jones et al., 2012; 22009941, Wiegand et al., 2010; 20942669, Jones et al., 2010; 20826764, Zang et al., 2012; 22484628, Wang et al., 2011; 22037554), whereas ARID1A missense mutations are mostly uncharacterized. ARID1A alterations are particularly prevalent in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (46_50%), ovarian and uterine endometrioid carcinomas (24_44%), and cholangiocarcinoma (27%); they are also reported in up to 27% of gastric carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, pediatric Burkitt lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, and urothelial carcinoma samples analyzed (COSMIC, cBioPortal, 2021) (Tate et al., 2019; 30371878, Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Wu et al., 2014; 24618703, Jones et al., 2012; 22009941, Dulak et al., 2013; 23525077, Streppel et al., 2013; 23318448, Jiao et al., 2014; 24293293, Ross et al., 2014; 24563076). ARID1A loss is associated with microsatellite instability in ovarian and endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinomas (Huang et al., 2014; 25195947, Hussein et al., 2014; 25394778, Bosse et al., 2013; 23702729, Allo et al., 2014; 23887303, Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729), CRC (Chou et al., 2014; 24925223, Ye et al., 2014; 25311944, Wei et al., 2014; 25561809, Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729), and gastric cancer (Chen et al., 2015; 25583476, Wang et al., 2011; 22037554, Abe et al., 2012; 22915242, Wang et al., 2012; 22808142, Wiegand et al., 2014; 24767857, Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729). ARID1A protein loss is reportedly more common in mismatch repair_deficient, BRAF V600E_mutated CRC tumors and is correlated with poor tumor staging and distant metastases, although data regarding an association between ARID1A protein loss and overall survival in CRC are mixed (Chou et al., 2014; 24925223, Ye et al., 2014; 25311944, Wei et al., 2014; 25561809). There are no therapies approved to address the mutation or loss of ARID1A in cancer. However, on the basis of limited clinical and preclinical evidence, ARID1A inactivating mutations may lead to sensitivity to ATR inhibitors such as M6620 and ceralasertib (Williamson et al., 2016; 27958275). In a Phase 2 study of ceralasertib in solid tumors, 2 patients with endometrial carcinoma in the cohort with loss of ARID1A expression achieved CRs on ceralasertib monotherapy; at least 1 of these 2 patients carried an inactivating ARID1A mutation. In contrast, no responses were observed for patients with normal ARID1A expression treated with ceralasertib combined with olaparib (Aggarwal et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 512O). One patient with small cell lung cancer harboring an ARID1A mutation experienced a PR when treated with M6620 combined with topotecan (Thomas et al., 2018; 29252124). In a Phase 1 trial, a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer harboring both an ARID1A mutation and ATM loss treated with single_agent M6620 achieved a CR that was ongoing at 29 months (Yap et al., 2020; 32568634). On the basis of limited preclinical evidence from studies in ovarian cancer, ARID1A inactivation may predict sensitivity to EZH2 inhibitors (Bitler et al., 2015; 25686104, Kim et al., 2015; 26552009), which are under investigation in clinical trials. Other studies have reported that the loss of ARID1A may activate the PI3K_AKT pathway and be linked with sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway (Wiegand et al., 2014; 24559118, Huang et al., 2014; 24336158, Samartzis et al., 2014; 24979463). Patients with ARID1A alterations in advanced or metastatic solid tumors may derive benefit from treatment with anti_PD_1 or anti_PD_L1 immunotherapy (Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729). Loss of ARID1A expression has been associated with chemoresistance to platinum_based therapy for patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma (Yokoyama et al., 2014; 24459582, Katagiri et al., 2012; 22101352) and to 5_fluorouracil in colorectal cancer cell lines (Xie et al., 2014; 24833095).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "ARID1A loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to ATR inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT02264678", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02630199", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03641547", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03669601", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02595931", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "MYC", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "rearrangement intron 1", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "rearrangement intron 1"}}, "Interpretation": "MYC (c_MYC) encodes a transcription factor that regulates many genes related to cell cycle regulation and cell growth. It is an oncogene and may be activated in as many as 20% of cancers (Dang et al., 2006; 16904903). MYC dysregulation (amplification, overexpression, translocation) has been identified in a number of different cancer types (Nesbit et al., 1999; 10378696). Rearrangements such as observed here which separate the MYC protein_coding sequences (exons 2_3) from endogenous regulatory elements have been reported in the context of cancer and have been suggested to result in increased MYC expression (Boxer and Dang, 2001; 11607812). However, the particular rearrangement observed here has not been directly characterized, and its effect on MYC expression is unknown. Mutation and amplification of MYC have been observed in up to 2% and 5% of patients with colorectal cancer, respectively (cBioPortal, COSMIC, Sep 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Overexpression of MYC in colorectal carcinoma has been reported to occur in the absence of MYC amplification (Erisman et al., 1985; 3837853, Erisman et al., 1988; 3283655, Wang et al., 1994; 8086630). MYC is a target gene of beta_catenin and may be upregulated by aberrant WNT signaling in colorectal cancer (Herbst et al., 2014; 24467841). MYC overexpression has been reported in 62_91% of colorectal carcinomas studied (Huang et al., 2013; 24240588, Toon et al., 2014; 24503701, Erisman et al., 1985; 3837853, Wang et al., 1994; 8086630). MYC protein overexpression was reported to be a favorable prognostic biomarker in patients with colorectal cancer, and patients with low_level MYC amplification have been found to have significantly longer survival (Toon et al., 2014; 24503701, Augenlicht et al., 1997; 9135021). However, MYC amplification and high expression have been associated with metastatic and aggressive colorectal tumors (Wang et al., 1994; 8086630, Monnat et al., 1987; 3040597). There are no available therapies that directly target MYC. However, preclinical data indicate that MYC overexpression may predict sensitivity to investigational agents targeting CDK1 (Horiuchi et al., 2012; 22430491, Goga et al., 2007; 17589519), CDK2 (Molenaar et al., 2009; 19525400), Aurora kinase A (Dammert et al., 2019; 31375684, Mollaoglu et al., 2017; 28089889, Robert et al., 2017; 29088717, Wang et al., 2017; 28417568, Takahashi et al., 2015; 25632068, Li et al., 2018; 30226440, Kong et al., 2017; DOI: 10.21037/tcr.2017.06.41, Mahadeva et al.,2014; 24893165, Park et al., 2019; 31429028), Aurora kinase B (Helfrich et al., 2016; 27496133, Hook et al., 2012; 22222631, Yang et al., 2010; 20643922, He et al., 2019; 30540594), glutaminase (Shroff et al., 2015; 25964345, Effenberger et al., 2017; 29156762, Shen et al., 2018; 30103944, Xiang et al., 2015; 25915584), or BET bromodomain_containing proteins (Delmore et al., 2011; 21889194, Bandopadhayay et al., 2013; 24297863, Loven et al., 2013; 23582323, Otto et al., 2019; 31734632), as well as agents targeting both HDAC and PI3K (Dong et al., 2013; 23866964, Pei et al., 2016; 26977882; Fu et al., 2019; 30224636). A Phase 2 study reported a PFS benefit associated with a combination of the Aurora A kinase inhibitor alisertib and paclitaxel as second_line therapy for patients with MYC_overexpressed small cell lung cancer but not for patients without MYC overexpression (Simmons et al., 2020; 31655296). A patient with MYC_amplified invasive ductal breast carcinoma experienced a PR to an Aurora kinase inhibitor (Ganesan et al., 2014; 25253784). The glutaminase inhibitor CB_839, in combination with either everolimus or cabozantinib, has demonstrated encouraging efficacy in Phase 1 and 2 studies enrolling patients with pretreated advanced renal cell carcinoma (Tannir et al., 2018; ASCO GU Abstract 603, Motzer et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA54). As it is unclear if the rearrangement seen here results in expression of an oncogenic protein, it is not known whether these therapeutic approaches would be relevant. MYC amplification has also been suggested to predict response to chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer in some studies (Pereira et al., 2013; 23555992, Yasojima et al., 2011; 21741827). Preclinical evidence suggests that colon cancer cells with MYC amplification may be more sensitive to 5_fluorouracil and paclitaxel (Arango et al., 2001; 11406570, Bottone et al., 2003; 14516787).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "MYC overexpression may predict sensitivity to inhibition of CDKs, especially CDK1 and CDK2, of Aurora kinases, including Aurora kinase A and B, and of BET domain proteins, which are reported to downregulate MYC expression and MYC_dependent transcriptional programs.

Activation of RAS signaling causes cell growth, differentiation, and survival by activating the RAF_MAPK_ERK, PI3K, and other pathways (Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244). NRAS alterations affecting amino acids G12, G13, G60, Q61, as well as mutations I24N, T50I, T58I, and A146T have been characterized as activating and oncogenic (Buhrman et al., 2010; 20194776, Cirstea et al., 2010; 19966803, Colicelli, 2004; 15367757, Edkins et al., 2006; 16969076, Feig and Cooper, 1988; 3043178, Janakiraman et al., 2010; 20570890, Lukman et al., 2010; 20838576, Prior et al., 2012; 22589270, Priv\u00e9 et al., 1992; 1565661, Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Runtuwene et al., 2011; 21263000, Scheffzek et al., 1997; 9219684, Smith et al., 2010; 20147967, Tyner et al., 2009; 19075190, Gremer et al., 2011; 20949621, Altmuller et al., 2017; 28594414, Hiippala et al., 2016; 26888048). NRAS mutation, commonly at codon 61, has been observed in 2_9% of colorectal cancers (Pentheroudakis et al., 2013; 23374602, Vaughn et al., 2011; 21305640, Janku et al., 2013; 23400451, De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739, Irahara et al., 2010; 20736745). For patients with CRC, NRAS mutations have been reported to be associated with increased frequency of metastasis (Guo et al., 2018; 29666387) and shorter survival (Schirripa et al., 2015; 24806288, Cercek et al., 2017; 28446505). On the basis of clinical evidence in hematologic malignancies (Slosberg et al., 2018; 29765547, Ravandi et al., 2015; 26657199, Maiti et al., 2019; 30635233, Khanna et al., 2015; 26870618, Heuck et al., 2014; ASH Abstract 4775) and solid tumors (Slosberg et al., 2018; 29765547, Wu et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P1.01_97, Dummer et al., 2017; 28284557, Ascierto et al., 2013; 23414587) as well as preclinical evidence (Burgess et al., 2014; 25361812, Ohashi et al., 2013; 23515407, Posch et al., 2015; 26016894, Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Vogel et al., 2015; 25728708), NRAS activating alterations may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, such as trametinib, cobimetinib, and binimetinib. Preclinical studies have suggested that MEK inhibitors, either alone or in combination with other therapies, may exhibit at least some activity in NRAS_mutated CRC (Wang et al., 2013; 23274911, Migliardi et al., 2012; 22392911). Although the presence of a KRAS mutation in CRC has been associated with lack of efficacy to monotherapy MEK inhibitors (Infante et al., 2012; 22805291, Zimmer et al., 2014; 24947927, Bennouna et al., 2011; 20127139, Weekes et al., 2013; 23434733), the extent to which other alterations affecting this pathway, such as observed here, confers sensitivity to MEK inhibitors is unclear (Tsimberidou et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract e22086). Preclinical data in cancer cell lines indicates that NRAS mutation predicts sensitivity to the PI3K_alpha_specific inhibitor alpelisib (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574). Activating mutations in KRAS or NRAS are associated with lack of clinical benefit from cetuximab (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Bokemeyer et al., 2011; 21228335, Karapetis et al., 2008; 18946061, De Roock et al., 2008; 17998284) or panitumumab (Douillard et al., 2014; 24718886, Douillard et al., 2012; 24024839, Amado et al., 2008; 18316791) for patients with CRC.

A prospective study of first_line cetuximab for patients with KRAS/NRAS/BRAF mutation_negative metastatic CRC resulted in limited efficacy, with 10.5% (2/19) of participants experiencing PRs and 57.9% (11/19) experiencing SDs (Moiseyenko et al., 2018; 29470838). The Phase 2 AVETUX trial of cetuximab combined with avelumab and mFOLFOX6 for patients with RAS_ and BRAF_wild_type metastatic CRC resulted in an ORR of 79.5% (6 CR and 25 PRs, n=39) and a DCR of 92.3% (Stein et al., 2020; ASCO GI Abstract 96).

Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TSC1 function or expression (Miloloza et al., 2000; 10915759, Hoogeveen_Westerveld et al., 2010; 20547222, Hodges et al., 2001; 11741833). TSC1 mutation has been reported in 1_4% of colorectal adenocarcinoma samples (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, cBio_Seshagiri et al., 2012; 22895193, cBio_Brannon et al., 2014; 25164765, cBio_Giannakis et al., 2016; 27149842). One study reported down_regulation of TSC1 expression in both colorectal tumors and adenomatous polyp lesions compared to normal mucosa (Dai et al., 2012; 22363125). TSC1 SNPs have been associated with increased risk of rectal cancer (Slattery et al., 2010; 20622004) and worse disease_free and overall survival for patients with colorectal cancer (Lee et al., 2014; 24770722). Loss or inactivation of TSC1 can activate mTOR signaling (Tee et al., 2003; 12906785, Mallela et al., 2021; 33575875); however, response rates for patients with TSC1_mutated solid tumors treated with MTOR inhibitors such as everolimus and temsirolimus have been low (Adib et al., 2021; 33727259, Nassar et al., 2020; 31653662, Voss et al., 2019; 30327302). In the prospective NCI_MATCH study, the ORR for patients with various TSC1_mutated solid tumors treated with everolimus was 7.7% (1/13); the single response was reported for a patient with urothelial cancer (Adib et al., 2021; 33727259). In TSC1_mutated renal cell carcinoma (RCC), although responses to MTOR inhibitors have been described in multiple case series and reports (Ali et al., 2015; 25796537, Lim et al., 2016; 26859683, Kwiatkowski et al., 2016; 26831717, Hamieh et al., 2018; 30256787, Roldan_Romero et al., 2020; 31335987), retrospective analysis of a broader cohort showed no responses in TSC1_mutated RCC (0/7) (Nassar et al., 2020; 31653662). Retrospective analyses of the RECORD_3, GRANITE_1, and EVOLVE_1 studies of everolimus to treat patients with RCC, gastric cancer, or hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively, showed no significant association between alterations in MTOR, TSC1, or TSC2 and median PFS (Voss et al., 2019; 30327302). PRs have been reported for patients with TSC1_altered perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (Wagner et al., 2021; 34637337, Kopparthy and Murphy, 2021; 34123648) and epithelial ovarian carcinoma (Dickson et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3111) treated with nab_sirolimus. Multiple clinical studies report that inhibitors of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway have not produced significant clinical benefit as monotherapies to treat CRC, even for tumors that harbor alterations in PIK3CA or PTEN; data are more limited for alterations in other genes in this pathway (Ng et al., 2013; 23743569, Ganesan et al., 2013; 24092809, Janku et al., 2014; 24440717). Inactivating germline mutations in TSC1 are associated with the autosomal dominant disorder tuberous sclerosis complex, which results in the development of hamartomas in multiple organ systems and an increased risk of developing renal cell carcinoma (Gomez, 1991; 2039135, van Slegtenhorst et al., 1997; 9242607). TSC1 mutations account for approximately 10 to 30% of reported sporadic cases (Crino et al., 2006; 17005952). Prevalence for this disorder in the general population is estimated to be 1/6,000 from birth and 1/12,000 to 1/14,000 in children under 10 years of age (Curatolo et al., 2008; 18722871).

APC interacts with beta_catenin and controls signaling in the WNT pathway, which regulates embryonic development and cell differentiation (Logan and Nusse, 2004; 15473860). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt APC function or expression (Eklof et al., 2001; 11707392, Liu et al., 2006; 16753179, Dikovskaya et al., 2010; 20144988, Murphy et al., 2007; 17410430, Aretz et al., 2004; 15459959). APC alterations have been found in 77% of tumors in the Colorectal Adenocarcinoma TCGA dataset (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696). Inactivation of APC leads to activation of the Wnt/beta_catenin pathway, which is thought to play a role in the adenoma_carcinoma transition in some cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC) (Fu et al., 2011; 21455986). The prognostic significance of APC mutations in sporadic CRC remains unclear (Quyn et al., 2008; 19110823). Solid tumors with WNT/beta_catenin pathway alterations, as seen here, were observed to have significantly less T_cell inflammation in one study (Luke et al., 2019; 30635339). There are no approved drugs targeted to APC defects or WNT upregulation in solid tumors. Preclinical studies have reported that APC inactivation or beta_catenin activation confer synthetic lethality when TRAIL receptors are upregulated and the TRAIL death receptor program is activated (Zhang et al., 2010; 20348907). In addition, the COX_2 inhibitor celecoxib was shown to reduce WNT signaling in cancer cell lines (Lu et al., 2009; 19026633, Tuynman et al., 2008; 18281498). A preclinical study has found that a small_molecule tankyrase inhibitor shows some activity in APC_mutant CRC models (Lau et al., 2013; 23539443). One or more of the APC variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (ClinVar, Sep 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in APC are found in more than 90% of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) (Kerr et al., 2013; 23159591, Fearon, 2011; 21090969, Kastritis et al., 2009; 18844223).

High bTMB levels were not detected in this sample. It is unclear whether the bTMB levels in this sample would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Depending on the clinical context, TMB testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. In 1 study, the median plasma TMB for 163 patients with metastatic CRC was 16.3 muts/Mb (approximately 8 muts/Mb as measured by this assay) (Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61). In a study for 61 patients with metastatic, microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC treated with best standard of care, plasma TMB scores \u226528 muts/Mb (approximately 14 muts/Mb as measured by this assay) were associated with reduced OS as compared with plasma TMB scores <28 muts/Mb (3.0 vs. 5.3 months, HR 0.76, p=0.007), whereas tissue TMB was not found to be prognostic in this population (Chen et al., 2020; 32379280, Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61). On the basis of clinical evidence in NSCLC and HSNCC, increased bTMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511) and anti_PD_1 (Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074) therapies. In NSCLC, multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 to 16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). In HNSCC, a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "DNMT3A", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "R882S", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "R882S"}}, "Interpretation": "The DNMT3A gene encodes the protein DNA methyltransferase 3A, an enzyme that is involved in the methylation of newly synthesized DNA, a function critical for gene regulation (Trowbridge and Orkin, 2012; 22200773, Ch\u00e9din, 2011; 21507354). The role of DNMT3A in cancer is uncertain, as some reports describe increased expression and contribution to tumor growth, whereas others propose a role for DNMT3A as a tumor suppressor (Yang et al., 2011; 21887466, Vallb\u00f6hmer et al., 2006; 16870044, Daskalos et al., 2011; 21351083, Fabbri et al., 2007; 17890317, Gao et al., 2011; 22011581, Kim et al., 2013; 23031157). Mutations at codon 882, including R882S, R882H, and R882C, have demonstrated reduced methyltransferase activity in vitro, with R882H and R882C conferring increased cell proliferation (Yan et al., 2011; 21399634, Holz_Schietinger et al., 2012; 22722925, Metzeler et al., 2012; 22124213). About half of all DNMT3A mutations in AML are R882H, which leads to a partially defective enzyme and altered oligomerization behavior, although the effect on global methylation remains to some extent controversial; in addition, at least one report suggests that mutation of R882 is associated with sensitivity to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (reviewed in Abdel_Wahab and Levine, 2013; 23640996, Yan et al., 2011; 21399634, Metzeler et al., 2012; 22124213, Holz_Schietinger et al., 2012; 22722925). On the basis of this, any alteration at R882 is likely to promote tumorigenesis, although the efficacy of DNMT inhibitors may not be consistent for all mutations. DNMT3A alterations have been reported at relatively low frequencies in solid tumors and are more prevalent in hematological malignancies (cBioPortal, Feb 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of DNMT3A alterations in solid tumors are limited (PubMed, Feb 2021). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in DNMT3A in solid tumors. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Cannot Be Determined", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Cannot Be Determined"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. Approximately 10_15% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) are MSI_high (MSI_H), 8_16% are MSI_low (MSI_L), and the remaining majority are microsatellite_stable (MSS) (Jass et al., 1999; 10562815, Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894). Multiple studies have shown that MSI_H CRCs have a better prognosis than MSI_low (MSI_L) or microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors (Samowitz et al., 2001; 11535541, Elsaleh and Iacopetta, 2001; 12445368, Brueckl et al., 2003; 12820457, Guidoboni et al., 2001; 11438476, Gryfe et al., 2000; 10631274, Sinicrope et al., 2006; 16952542, Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Laghi and Malesci, 2012; 22722556). MSI_H CRCs are associated with certain pathologic and molecular features, including poor differentiation, right_sided and mucinous tumors, increased numbers of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, diploidy, and a relatively high frequency of BRAF mutations (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). The prognostic implications of MS_Equivocal status for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) have not been evaluated in published studies. One study reported that microsatellite instability_low (MSI_L) tumors occur more frequently in early_stage CRC than advanced CRC (Kambara et al., 2001; 11691787); in contrast, another study found that MSI_L status is associated with advanced stage and worse OS for patients with CRC (Esfahani et al., 2019; 30549036). MSI_L CRCs resemble MS_Stable tumors in most clinicopathologic features (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947) but harbor a significantly higher frequency of KRAS mutations than MS_Stable tumors (Jass et al., 1999; 10562815, Kambara et al., 2001; 11691787, Konishi et al., 1996; 8690195). MSS colorectal cancers are molecularly heterogeneous, driven by diverse mechanisms such as extensive DNA methylation, oncogenic mutations in KRAS or BRAF, or chromosomal instability (Jass, 2007; 17204026). On the basis of prospective clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD_1_targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143) and PD_L1_targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92). Pembrolizumab therapy resulted in a significantly higher ORR in MSI_H CRC compared with MSS CRC (40% vs. 0%)(Le et al., 2015; 26028255). Similarly, a clinical study of nivolumab, alone or in combination with ipilimumab, in patients with CRC reported a significantly higher response rate in patients with tumors with high MSI than those without (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635). An earlier case study reported that nivolumab therapy resulted in a complete response in a patient with MSI_H CRC (Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436). A Phase 1b trial of atezolizumab combined with bevacizumab reported PRs for 40% (4/10) of patients with MSI_H CRC (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673). As the MSI status of this tumor is unknown, the relevance of these therapeutic approaches is unclear. MSI has not been found to be a predictive biomarker for combination chemotherapy regimens, including FOLFOX (Sinicrope et al., 2013; 24019539, Gavin et al., 2012; 23045248) and FOLFIRI (Bertagnolli et al., 2009; 19273709, Van Cutsem et al., 2009; 19451425). Patients with MSS CRC are more likely to benefit from postsurgical fluorouracil (FU)_based adjuvant therapy (Ribic et al., 2003; 12867608, Sargent et al., 2010; 20498393) but less likely to benefit from irinotecan chemotherapy (Fallik et al., 2003; 14522894). While approximately 80% of MSI_H tumors arise due to somatic inactivation of an MMR pathway protein, about 20% arise due to germline mutations in one of the MMR genes (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942), which are associated with a condition known as Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC) (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756). Lynch syndrome leads to an increased risk of colorectal, endometrial, gastric, and other cancers (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756, Pande et al., 2012; 22714864, Kastrinos and Syngal, 2007; 17920897) and has an estimated prevalence in the general population ranging from 1:600 to 1:2000 (Silva et al., 2009; 19466295, Sehgal et al., 2014; 24978665, de la Chapelle et al., 2005; 16136383). Therefore, in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "SDHB", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "R217C", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "R217C"}}, "Interpretation": "SDHB encodes the succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit B, flavoprotein. This protein is involved in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. SDH deficiency due to germline inactivating mutations in SDH genes is associated with paraganglioma\u2013pheochromocytoma syndrome (PGL/PCC), Leigh syndrome, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), which typically do not harbor mutations in KIT or PDGFRA and are not sensitive to treatment with imatinib (Tirumani et al., 2014; 25189191, Hoekstra et al., 2013; 23174333, Belinsky et al., 2013; 23730622, Renkema et al., 2015; 24781757). Somatic mutations in SDHB are rare and have been observed in fewer than 0.6% of tumors across all cancer types (COSMIC, 2021)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). SDH deficiency has been associated with an aggressive subset of renal cell carcinoma with distinctive clinical and morphological features, affecting mostly younger patients (Pail et al., 2014; 24395865, Williamson et al., 2014; 25034258, Ricketts et al., 2012; 23083876, van Nederveen et al., 2009; 19576851). There are no therapies available to directly target the loss or inactivation of SDH genes. Preclinical studies have shown that succinate, which can accumulate as a result of SDH inactivation, promotes angiogenesis via VEGF upregulation (Mu et al., 2017; 28061458, Selak et al., 2005; 15652751). Case studies have reported objective responses in patients with renal cell carcinoma harboring either SDHA or SDHC alterations treated with multikinase inhibitors that target VEGFR, including sunitinib and pazopanib (McEvoy et al., 2018; doi:10.1038/s41698_018_0053_2)(Shuch et al., 2016; 25024072); however, these clinical data are limited. In a Phase 2 trial of vandetanib for children and adults with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) with decreased SDH expression that were wild_type for KIT and PDGFRA, no partial or complete responses were observed and 2/9 patients experienced prolonged stable disease (Glod et al., 2019; 31439578). One or more of the SDHB variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with hereditary paraganglioma_pheochromocytoma syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. In the context of hereditary paraganglioma_pheochromocytoma, SDHB mutations are autosomal dominant (Hensen et al., 2004; 15064708) and associated with an increased risk of developing malignant and metastatic disease (van Hulsteijn et al., 2012; 23099648, Lenders et al., 2017; 28685506). SDHB has an increased malignancy risk compared with that of SDHC or SDHD mutation (Benn et al., 2015; 26273102). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of SDHB is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "V157fs*19", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "V157fs*19"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 mutations have been reported in up to 60% of colorectal cancer cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Goh et al., 1995; 7585578, Berg et al., 2010; 21103049, Han et al., 2013; 23700467, Peeters et al., 2013; 23325582, Malhotra et al., 2013; 23526092, Di Bartolomeo et al., 2013; 23821376). A study reported p53 expression in 49% of analyzed colorectal cancer cases (Wangefjord et al., 2013; 23337059). TP53 mutation has not been consistently demonstrated to be a significant independent prognostic marker in the context of CRC (Russo et al., 2005; 16172461). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% (17/176) and SDs in 53.4% (94/176) of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21.1% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12.1% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wild_type (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 31.9% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73.4% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 42.9% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76.2% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24.0% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71.4% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75.0% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Additionally, the combination of a CHK1 inhibitor and irinotecan reportedly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival in a TP53_mutated, but not TP53_wild_type, breast cancer xenotransplant mouse model (Ma et al., 2012; 22446188). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Fraction", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "67", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "67"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor fraction provides an estimate of the percentage of ctDNA present in a cell_free DNA (cfDNA) sample. The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with high tumor fraction values have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus higher sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at a lower risk of false negative results (Li et al., 2021; AACR Abstract 2231). However, if tumor fraction is not detected as high, it does not exclude the presence of disease burden or compromise the confidence of reported alterations. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels. In the research setting, changes in tumor fraction estimates have been associated with treatment duration and clinical response and may be a useful indicator for future cancer management (Bronkhorst et al., 2019; 30923679, Raja et al., 2018; 30093454, Hrebien et al., 2019; 30860573, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5039, Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Goodall et al., 2017; 28450425, Goldberg et al., 2018; 29330207).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "ARID1A", "Alteration": "W2050*", "Title": "Ascending Doses of AZD6738 in Combination With Chemotherapy and/or Novel Anti Cancer Agents", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1/2", "Target": "ATR, PARP, PD_L1", "Locations": "Seongnam_si (Korea, Republic of), Seoul (Korea, Republic of), Cambridge (United Kingdom), Withington (United Kingdom), London (United Kingdom), Sutton (United Kingdom), Villejuif (France), Saint Herblain (France), California", "NCTID": "NCT02264678", "Note": "ARID1A loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to ATR inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "ARID1A", "Alteration": "W2050*", "Title": "Study of AZD6738, DNA Damage Repair/Novel Anti_cancer Agent, in Combination With Paclitaxel, in Refractory Cancer", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "ATR", "Locations": "Seoul (Korea, Republic of)", "NCTID": "NCT02630199", "Note": "ARID1A loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to ATR inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "ARID1A", "Alteration": "W2050*", "Title": "M6620 Plus Standard Treatment in Oesophageal and Other Cancer", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "ATR", "Locations": "Glasgow (United Kingdom), Manchester (United Kingdom), Oxford (United Kingdom), Cardiff (United Kingdom)", "NCTID": "NCT03641547", "Note": "ARID1A loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to ATR inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "ARID1A", "Alteration": "W2050*", "Title": "AZD6738 & Gemcitabine as Combination Therapy", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "ATR", "Locations": "Cambridge (United Kingdom)", "NCTID": "NCT03669601", "Note": "ARID1A loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to ATR inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "ARID1A", "Alteration": "W2050*", "Title": "ATR Kinase Inhibitor VX_970 and Irinotecan Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors That Are Metastatic or Cannot Be Removed by Surgery", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "ATR", "Locations": "California, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Tennessee, Florida", "NCTID": "NCT02595931", "Note": "ARID1A loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to ATR inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "MYC", "Alteration": "rearrangement intron 1", "Title": "A Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Efficacy of CC_90010 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors and Relapsed/Refractory Non_Hodgkin s Lymphomas", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, BRDT", "Locations": "Kashiwa (Japan), Meldola (Italy), Napoli, Campania (Italy), Rozzano (MI) (Italy), Villejuif (France), Bordeaux (France), Barcelona (Spain), Madrid (Spain)", "NCTID": "NCT03220347", "Note": "MYC overexpression may predict sensitivity to inhibition of CDKs, especially CDK1 and CDK2, of Aurora kinases, including Aurora kinase A and B, and of BET domain proteins, which are reported to downregulate MYC expression and MYC_dependent transcriptional programs.
