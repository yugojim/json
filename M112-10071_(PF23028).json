Loss of functional ATM promotes tumorigenesis (Cremona and Behrens, 2014; 23851492). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt ATM function or expression (Jiang et al., 2006; 16603769, Fernandes et al., 2005; 15713674, Scott et al., 2002; 11805335). Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. ATM mutations were identified in 2/80 of ampulla of Vater carcinomas in one study (Mafficini et al., 2016; 27611608) and in 1/25 ampullary carcinoma samples in another (Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359). ATM mutations have been reported infrequently in cholangiocarcinoma (5%)(Jiao et al., 2013; 24185509). ATM alterations have been observed in various solid tumors, with mutations being more frequent than gene loss and often seen in small bowel (7_9%), endometrial (7%), non_melanoma skin (3_6%), bladder (5%), hepatobiliary (4_5%), colorectal (4_5%), and lung (3%) cancer (cBio_Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359, Nguyen et al., 2022; 35120664). Expression of the ATM protein has been observed in 67.7% of pancreatic tumors, where it was correlated with p53 expression (Yu et al., 2004; 15097860). Some familial mutations in ATM have been suggested to increase the risk of developing pancreatic cancer (Roberts et al., 2012; 22585167, Geoffroy_Perez et al., 2001; 11410879). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of ATM alterations in ampullary adenocarcinoma are limited (PubMed, Jun 2022). Loss of functional ATM results in a defective DNA damage response and homologous recombination_mediated DNA repair and may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Michels et al., 2014; 24037533, Bryant and Helleday, 2006; 16556909). Clinical responses have been reported for patients with ATM_mutated prostate cancer treated with PARP inhibitors (Mateo et al., 2015; 26510020, Mateo et al., 2020; 31806540, de Bono et al., 2020; ASCO GU Abstract 119, Abida et al., 2020; 32086346) and PARP inhibitors have shown limited clinical benefit for patients with other ATM_mutated solid tumors including pancreatic cancer (Ma et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 563, Dhawan et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 3513), colorectal cancer (Ma et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 563, Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006, Papageorgiou et al., 2021; 35004311), papillary renal cell carcinoma (Olson et al., 2016; 27079472), ovarian cancer (Swisher et al., 2021; 33941784), small cell bowel cancer, (Dhawan et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 3513), and biliary tract cancer (Piha_Paul et al., 2018; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract A096, Zhang et al., 2020; 32045060). In Phase 1 trials of ATR inhibitors, a heavily pretreated patient with colorectal cancer who achieved a CR to berzosertib (O Carrigan et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2504) and 4 out of 4 patients with diverse solid tumors who achieved PRs to BAY1895344 (Yap et al., 2020; 32988960) harbored ATM inactivation or protein loss. In a Phase 2 study of a combination of the ATR inhibitor ceralasertib and durvalumab for patients with advanced gastric cancer, objective responses (ORs) were experienced by 50% (4/8) of patients with loss of ATM expression, compared with 14% (3/21) patients with intact ATM (Kwon et al., 2022; 35790315). Studies showing reduced cell viability and increased DNA damage in preclinical models of solid tumors (Menezes et al., 2015; 25232030, Vendetti et al., 2015; 26517239, Min et al., 2017; 28138034) and hematologic malignancies (Menezes et al., 2015; 25232030, Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132) also support the increased sensitivity of ATM_deficient cells to ATR inhibitors. Preclinical experiments also indicate that loss of ATM causes dependency on DNA_PKcs in cancer cells; DNA_PKcs inhibitors promoted apoptosis in ATM_deficient cells and were active in a lymphoma mouse model lacking ATM activity (Riabinska et al., 2013; 23761041). One or more of the ATM variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with ataxia_telangiectasia syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. ATM mutation carriers have increased cancer risk, with female carriers displaying a 38% lifetime risk of breast cancer (van Os et al., 2016; 26662178). Biallelic mutations in ATM underlie the rare autosomal_recessive inherited disorder ataxia_telangiectasia (A_T), also referred to as genome instability or DNA damage response syndrome (Rothblum_Oviatt et al., 2016; 27884168). This disease is characterized by genomic instability, sensitivity to DNA_damaging agents, and increased risk of developing cancer (Shiloh and Ziv, 2013; 23847781, Rothblum_Oviatt et al., 2016; 27884168). The prevalence of A_T is estimated at 1:40,000 to 1:100,000 worldwide (Rothblum_Oviatt et al., 2016; 27884168). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of ATM is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors may detect nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

This sample harbors a bTMB level that may be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Average bTMB levels in solid tumors other than NSCLC have not been evaluated (PubMed, Mar 2023). Hypermutated cases were enriched in a poor prognosis subgroup of patients with biliary tract cancer (Nakamura et al., 2015; 26258846), but the effects of TMB on prognosis of patients with ampullary cancer have not been extensively investigated (PubMed, Sep 2022). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB) may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716), anti_PD_1 (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716), anti_PD_1/CTLA4 therapies (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P), anti_PD_L1/CTLA4 therapies (Chen et al., 2020; 32379280, Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511, Rizvi et al., 2020; 32271377, Si et al., 2021; 33355200, Leighl et al., 2022; 34800700). A Phase 2 multi_solid_tumor trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022). In non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single_agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 Muts/Mb_16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2020; 32271377, Si et al., 2021; 33355200, Leighl et al., 2022; 34800700). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511). In colorectal cancer (CRC), a Phase 2 study showed that bTMB TMB \u226528 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u226514 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved OS from a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61, Chen et al., 2020; 32379280).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Increased tumor mutational burden may predict response to anti_PD_1 (alone or in combination with anti_CTLA_4) or anti_PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04237649", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04047862", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05166577", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03530397", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04261439", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04215978", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03821935", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05102006", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03744468", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05024214", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "CHEK2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "T387A", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "0.25", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "T387A"}}, "Interpretation": "CHEK2 encodes the protein checkpoint kinase 2, a serine/threonine kinase that plays an important role in the DNA_damage response; it is a putative tumor suppressor (Tomlinson et al., 2012; 22294770, Xu et al., 1990; 2205842, van der Groep et al., 2011; 21336636, Schutte et al., 2003; 12610780). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt CHEK2 function or expression (Xu et al., 2002; 12024051, Lee and Chung, 2001; 11390408, Schwarz et al., 2003; 12805407, Ng et al., 2003; 14681223, Matsuoka et al., 2000; 10973490, Zhou et al., 2000; 10744722, Ahn et al., 2000; 11085506, Melchionna et al., 2000; 11025670, Yoda et al., 2006; 16798742, Chehab et al., 2000; 10673500, Lee et al., 2001; 11719428). Somatic CHEK2 mutations have been reported in 0_3% of various solid tumors, with the highest incidence reported in prostate, brain, endometrial, urothelial, and skin tumors (COSMIC, Jan 2023)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). In breast cancer, certain CHEK2 mutations are associated with higher grade and larger tumors as well as bilateral disease (Kilpivaara et al., 2005; 15472904). A study reported that a polymorphism in CHEK2 was associated with worse survival of patients with GBM, but this association lost significance after adjusting for other prognostic factors (Simon et al., 2006; 17016233, Dong et al., 2014; 24532427). Another study in prostate cancer reported that CHEK2 expression is decreased in higher grade tumors and that CHEK2 is a tumor suppressor that decreases the growth of prostate cancer cells and regulates androgen receptor signaling (Ta et al., 2015; 26573794). Limited clinical data indicate that CHEK2 inactivation may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. Patients with CHEK2_altered prostate cancer have experienced clinical responses to PARP inhibitors (Abida et al., 2020; 32086346, Mateo et al., 2020; 31806540, Mateo et al., 2015; 26510020). Clinical benefit has been observed for patients with ovarian (Swisher et al., 2017; 27908594, O Malley et al., 2017; AACR Abstract LB_A12) and testicular (Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006) cancers treated with PARP inhibitors. In a study of patients with metastatic breast cancer, 8 patients with CHEK2 mutation did not respond to olaparib treatment (Tung et al., 2020; 33119476). One study of patients with breast cancer reported that carriers of the CHEK2 H371Y mutation have a higher likelihood of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Liu et al., 2015; 25884806), whereas another study found that those who carry CHEK2 mutations have a lower frequency of objective clinical responses to neoadjuvant therapy (Pfeifer et al., 2014; 25414026). A third study reported that the CHEK2 1100delC mutation is not associated with differential efficacy of chemotherapy and endocrine therapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer (Kriege et al., 2015; 25958056). Germline CHEK2 mutation has been associated with cancer susceptibility of low to moderate penetrance, especially in hereditary breast cancer (Mahdavi et al., 2019; 30552672). CHEK2 germline mutation has been identified in approximately 2.5% of familial or high_risk breast cancer cases (Kleiblov\u00e1 et al., 2019; 31409080, Hauke et al., 2018; 29522266). Although heterozygous germline CHEK2 mutation increases breast cancer risk two_ to three_fold, it is not associated with younger age at diagnosis (Hauke et al., 2018; 29522266, Lu et al., 2019; 30128536). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of CHEK2 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212).

ERBB2 mutation has been reported in 4% of ampulla of Vater carcinomas (Mafficini et al., 2016; 27611608), 0.5% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas (cBio_Bailey et al., 2016; 26909576), 8% (7/83) of small bowel adenocarcinomas (Laforest et al., 2014; 24797764), and 2.4% of bile duct carcinomas (COSMIC, Oct 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). ERBB2 amplification is more frequent in both ampullary and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, reported in 13_23% of ampulla of Vater carcinomas (Hechtman et al., 2015; 25975284, Ajiki et al., 2001; 11677943) and 6_25% of pancreatic carcinomas (cBio_Witkiewicz et al., 2015; 25855536, Sharif et al., 2008; 18463983, Tsiambas et al., 2006; 16685109). In small intestine carcinoma, ERBB2 amplification has been reported in 3_5% (3/83 to 10/184) of cases (Gu et al., 2013; 23703294, Laforest et al., 2014; 24797764). Several studies have suggested that HER2 expression is an unfavorable prognostic indicator in duodenal adenocarcinoma and ampulla of Vater carcinoma (Zhu et al., 1996; 8606540, Vaidya et al., 1996; 8683379, Vaidya et al., 1996; 8720669). In contrast, one study found that neither overexpression nor amplification of ERBB2 correlated with clinico_pathological features in small intestine carcinoma (Gu et al., 2013; 23703294). In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, ERBB2 amplification was not found to correlate significantly with patient survival in one study (Sharif et al., 2008; 18463983), but HER2 overexpression was reported to correlate with worse prognosis in other studies (Harder et al., 2012; 22374460, Komoto et al., 2009; 19432892, Safran et al., 2001; 11586103, Tsiambas et al., 2006; 16685109). On the basis of extensive clinical evidence, ERBB2 amplification or activating mutation may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting HER2, including antibodies such as trastuzumab (Slamon et al., 2001; 11248153, Bang et al., 2010; 20728210, Chumsri et al., 2015; 26358791, Cappuzzo et al., 2006; 16775247, Falchook et al., 2013; 23328556, Mazieres et al., 2013; 23610105), pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab (Baselga et al., 2012; 22149875, Swain et al., 2015; 25693012, Chumsri et al., 2015; 26358791, Meric_Bernstam et al., 2019; 30857956), and zanidatamab (ZW25) (Meric_Bernstam et al., 2022; 36400106), as well as antibody_directed conjugates such as ado_trastuzumab emtansine (T_DM1) (Verma et al., 2012; 23020162) and fam_trastuzumab deruxtecan (T_DXd) (Modi et al., 2020; 31825192, Shitara et al., 2020; 32469182, Li et al., 2022; 34534430, Smit et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 1361TiP), HER2 kinase inhibitors such as tucatinib (Murthy et al., 2020; 31825569, Borges et al., 2018; 29955792, Murthy et al., 2018; 29804905, Moulder et al., 2017; 28053022, Strickler et al., 2022; ESMO GI Abstract LBA_2), and dual EGFR/HER2 kinase inhibitors such as lapatinib (Fan et al., 2020; 32478891, Cameron et al., 2010; 20736298, Geyer et al., 2006; 17192538, Serra et al., 2013; 23950206, Ali et al., 2014; 24516025, Grellety et al., 2015; 26487584, Vornicova et al., 2014; 25085898, Ronellenfitsch et al., 2020; 32017710, Hou et al., 2020; 32405522), afatinib (Lin et al., 2012; 22418700, Schwab et al., 2014; 25268372, De Greve et al., 2015; 25682316, De Greve et al., 2012; 22325357, Li et al., 2015; 26559459, Mazieres et al., 2013; 23610105, Bedard et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT139, Dziadziuszko et al., 2019; 30825613, Lai et al., 2019; 30685684, Liu et al., 2018; 30425522, Fang et al., 2019; 31748336, Yuan et al., 2020; 32477948), neratinib (Ben_Baruch et al., 2015; 26358790, Ma et al., 2017; 28679771, Hyman et al., 2018; 29420467, Smyth et al., 2020; 31806627, Li et al., 2020; WCLC Abstract FP14.15), dacomitinib (Kris et al., 2015; 25899785), and pyrotinib (Jiang et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 1001, Xu et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 1003).

In patients with HER2_positive breast cancer with brain metastases, neratinib elicited a CNS ORR of 8% (3/40) (Freedman et al., 2016; 26834058). In a Phase 3 study of patients with HER2_positive, early stage breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab, neratinib significantly improved the 2_year invasive disease_free survival compared to placebo (HR=0.67, p=0.0091)(Chan et al., 2016; 26874901). In Phase 2 trials of single_agent neratinib for patients with ERBB2_mutated, non_amplified metastatic breast cancer, clinical benefit rates of 31_40% and median PFS of 3.5_4 months have been achieved (Ma et al., 2017; 28679771, Hyman et al., 2018; 29420467, Smyth et al., 2019; 31806627). Neratinib in combination with various other agents has also shown significant clinical activity against breast cancer (Hyman et al., 2016; SABCS Abstract PD2_08)(Saura et al., 2014; 25287822, Awada et al., 2012; 22967996, Martin et al., 2013; 23953056, Chow et al., 2013; 23632474, Park et al., 2016; 27406346, Awada et al., 2016; 27078022). In patients with ERBB2_mutated NSCLC, where the majority of cases harbor inhibitor_resistant exon 20 insertions, neratinib monotherapy has resulted in ORRs of 0_4% (Gandhi et al. 2017; WCLC Abstract MA04.02, Gandhi et al., 2014; 24323026, Hyman et al., 2018; 29420467, Li et al., 2020; WCLC Abstract FP14.15). However, clinical outcomes have been improved by combination of neratinib with other targeted agents, such as temsirolimus or trastuzumab (Gandhi et al., 2014; 24323026, Gandhi et al. 2017; WCLC Abstract MA04.02, Li et al., 2020; WCLC Abstract FP14.15). Trials of neratinib have shown high ORRs (up to 44%) in ERBB2_mutated cervical cancer (Hyman et al., 2018; 29420467, D Souza et al., 2019; SGO Abstract 18) but very low ORRs in colorectal and bladder cancer (Hyman et al., 2018; 29420467). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Lapatinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Lapatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets EGFR, ERBB2/HER2, and to a lesser degree, ERBB4.

RNF43 and the homologous E3 ubiquitin ligase ZNRF3 are tumor suppressors that function as negative regulators of WNT signaling (Hao et al., 2012; 22575959, Koo et al., 2012; 22895187, Jiang et al., 2013; 23847203, Koo et al., 2015; 26023187, Tsukiyama et al., 2015; 25825523). An additional tumor_suppressor_like role for RNF43 in colon cancer is hypothesized to occur via its interaction with the ubiquitin_protein ligase NEDL1, which is predicted to enhance the pro_apoptotic effects of p53 (Shinada et al., 2011; 21108931). Mutations in RNF43 have been reported in 18_27% of endometrial cancers (Kinde et al., 2013; 23303603, Giannakis et al., 2014; 25344691), 3_5% of pancreatic cancers (Madan and Virshup, 2015; 25901018), 21% of ovarian mucinous carcinomas (Ryland et al., 2013; 23096461), 9% of liver fluke_associated cholangiocarcinomas (Ong et al., 2012; 22561520), and up to 18% of colorectal cancers (Giannakis et al., 2014; 25344691, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696).

Preclinical studies have reported that RNF43 is a negative regulator of WNT signaling, and RNF43 loss or inactivation leads to WNT activation and confers sensitivity to WNT pathway inhibitors, particularly Porcupine inhibitors, in multiple tumor types (Hao et al., 2012; 22575959, Koo et al., 2012; 22895187, Jiang et al., 2013; 23847203, Koo et al., 2015; 26023187, Tsukiyama et al., 2015; 25825523, Cook et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 517MO).

Inherited microdeletions and truncating point mutations in CREBBP are reported to be causal in approximately 20% of cases of Rubinstein_Taybi syndrome (Pertij et al., 2000; 10699051). The chromosomal rearrangement t(8;16)(p11;p13) is characteristic of the M4/M5 subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and results in a chimeric gene fusing MYST3/MOZ (a gene essential for the development of the hematopoietic system and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells) to CREBBP (Borrow et al., 1996; 8782817). CREBBP_BCORL1 fusion has been reported in patients with ossifying fibromyxoid tumors (Kao et al., 2017; 27537276, Hofvander et al., 2020; 31932680). CREBBP mutations have been observed at high frequency in follicular lymphoma (FL, 26%) and diffuse large B_cell lymphoma (DLBCL, 16%), and at lower frequency in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, 7%), and tumors of the urinary tract (15%), skin (12%), liver (8.7%), endometrium (8.5%), and stomach (8.2%)(COSMIC, 2023)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). These mutations include missense substitutions clustered in the CREBBP histone acetyltransferase domain and truncating mutations throughout the gene sequence, suggesting a role for CREBBP inactivation in these diseases. CREBBP mutations have been reported to occur in the transition from prostate acinar carcinoma to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (Grasso et al., 2015; 25735316), which may indicate significance for CREBBP in SCC. In two cases of relapsed pediatric B_cell ALL, CREBBP mutation conferred resistance to glucocorticoid therapy (Ma et al., 2015; 25790293). Reports have found CREBBP mutation in 62_68% of patients with FL (Green et al., 2015; 25713363, Loeffler et al., 2015; 25027518), which was associated with immune evasion (Green et al., 2015; 25713363).

About half of all DNMT3A mutations in AML are R882H, which leads to a partially defective enzyme and altered oligomerization behavior, although the effect on global methylation remains to some extent controversial; in addition, at least one report suggests that mutation of R882 is associated with sensitivity to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (reviewed in Abdel_Wahab and Levine, 2013; 23640996, Yan et al., 2011; 21399634, Metzeler et al., 2012; 22124213, Holz_Schietinger et al., 2012; 22722925). On the basis of this, any alteration at R882 is likely to promote tumorigenesis, although the efficacy of DNMT inhibitors may not be consistent for all mutations. DNMT3A alterations have been reported at relatively low frequencies in solid tumors and are more prevalent in hematological malignancies (cBioPortal, COSMIC, PubMed, Feb 2023)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of DNMT3A alterations in solid tumors are limited (PubMed, Feb 2023). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in DNMT3A in solid tumors. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI_H has been reported in 8.2% of ampullary carcinoma samples (4/49) in one small study (Harthimmer et al., 2019; 31256008). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of MSI in ampullary adenocarcinoma are limited (PubMed, Aug 2022). Microsatellite instability_high (MSI_H) small intestine adenocarcinomas were reported to be higher tumor grade and associated with longer median OS (49.6 vs. 23.2 months) than microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors (Bruecki et al., 2004; 14732226, Ruemmele et al., 2009; 19252434, Muneyuki et al., 2000; 11117578, Agaramet al., 2010; 20395525). On the basis of clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD_1_targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Shitara et al., 2022; 35322232, Andre et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 244, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143), as well as PD_L1_targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (alone or in combination with tremelimumab) (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92, Pietrantonio et al., 2023; ASCO GI Abstract 358, Lee et al., 2023; ASCO GI abstract 401, Rubinstein et al., 2022; 36512912, Marie et al., 2021; 33811152).

TET2 alterations have been reported at relatively low frequencies in solid tumors and are more prevalent in hematological malignancies (cBio_Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359).

TNFAIP3 is frequently deleted or mutated in lymphoma, where it functions as a tumor suppressor (Honma et al., 2009; 19608751), but its expression and function are context dependent in solid tumors (Wang et al., 2016; 26909601, Couch et al., 2016; 27072986, Wang et al., 2015; 26485275, Harhaj and Dixit, 2011; 21119682, Salim et al., 2013; 23929716), leukemia (Saitoh et al., 2016; 26437781, Johansson et al., 2016; 26199174, Chen et al., 2015; 26159495), and multiple myeloma (Broyl et al., 2010; 20574050, Troppan et al., 2015; 25856582). TNFAIP3 mutations that disrupt the A20p37 chain (amino acids 371\u2013790), which mediates ubiquitin ligase activity and interaction with the cIAP1/TRAF2 complex (Wertz et al., 2004; 15258597, Yamaguchi et al., 2013; 24008839), are predicted to be inactivating. In T_cells, cleavage of A20 codon R439 by MALT1 has been shown to upregulate NFkB signaling; R439A has been shown to block MALT1_mediated NF_kB activation (Coornaert et al., 2008; 18223652); however, the function of R439 mutations outside of the context of T_cell lymphoma has not been reported. In the COSMIC dataset, TNFAIP3 mutations have been reported in 3.4% of prostate, 3.4% of skin, 2.8% of endometrial, and 2.3% of large intestine cancers (2023)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Overexpression of TNFAIP3 has been associated with aggressive high_grade ER_/PR_negative breast tumors (Vendrell et al., 2007; 17297453), resistance to TNF_alpha and TRAIL_induced apoptosis in glioblastoma (Hjelmeland et al., 2010; 20186265, Bellail et al., 2012; 22585859) and to chemotherapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Chen et al., 2015; 26159495), and poor prognosis in adrenocortical carcinoma (Hantel et al., 2016; 26768118). Loss of heterozygosity in the genomic region including TNFAIP3 has been found in 16.8% (25/149) of colorectal adenocarcinomas, and significantly decreased TNFAIP3 mRNA expression has been observed in colorectal cancer (CRC) tumors compared with adjacent non_neoplastic mucosa (Ungerb\u00e4ck et al., 2012; 22843550). Reduced A20 expression has been suggested as a marker of poor prognosis in CRC (Bavi et al., 2011; 22704353). There are no therapies that address the loss of TNFAIP3. A20 has multiple functions and is subject to a wide range of genomic lesions, thereby making it challenging to develop a unified therapeutic approach. Potential avenues targeting dysregulation of ubiquitination pathways include anti_CD20 therapies, such as rituximab, and proteasome inhibitors, such as bortezomib (Hymowitz and Wertz, 2010; 20383180). RNAi_mediated downregulation of TNFAIP3 has been reported to sensitize multiple myeloma cells to bortezomib (Zhu et al., 2011; 21289309).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Fraction", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor fraction provides an estimate of the percentage of ctDNA present in a cell_free DNA (cfDNA) sample. The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204).

There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels.

The S34F mutation is commonly found in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and is located in the first zinc finger domain of the protein; this alteration has been shown to affect splicing in preclinical cell_based assays (Graubert et al., 2011; 22158538, Yoshida et al., 2011; 21909114). This mutation has been reported to be a common mutation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), accounting for 47% of U2AF1 mutations in AML in one study (Przychodzen et al., 2013; 23775717). Mutations in U2AF1 have been reported in 2.9% of endometrial, 2.6% of peritoneal, 2.2% of small intestine, and less than 2% of other solid tumor types (COSMIC, Aug 2022) (Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). U2AF1 mutations have been associated with significantly shorter survival for patients with lung adenocarcinoma (Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975). There are no targeted therapies approved or in clinical trials that directly address genomic alterations in U2AF1; however, preclinical studies suggest that mutations in genes encoding spliceosome components, including U2AF1, may confer sensitivity to spliceosome inhibitors (Shirai et al., 2017; 28067246, Obeng et al., 2016; 27622333, Lee et al., 2016; 27135740, Yoshimi et al., 2017; 27836865, Lee et al., 2016; 27603132). In preclinical models, U2AF1 mutation leads to DNA damage and ATR pathway activation, rendering cells sensitive to ATR inhibitors both alone and in combination with spliceosome inhibitors (Chen et al., 2018; 29395063, Nguyen et al., 2018; 30054334). Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212).
