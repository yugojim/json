AKT2 is one of three members of the AKT gene family, and activation of AKT2 has been implicated in multiple malignancies (Liu et al., 1998; 9679957, Vivanco and Sawyers., 2002; 12094235). AKT isoforms appear to have different roles in tumorigenesis; AKT1 appears to contribute to the initiation of tumors, whereas AKT2 promotes invasion and metastasis in breast tumors (Chin and Toker., 2011; 21519185). Although AKT2 amplification has been reported to associate with AKT2 overexpression (Cheng et al., 1992; 1409633, Thompson et al., 1996; 8646743, Altomare and Testa., 2005; 16288292), studies in various cancers suggest that AKT2 phosphorylation may have greater clinical relevance than AKT2 amplification or mRNA overexpression (Cicenas., 2008; 18409144, Scrima et al., 2012; 22363436). AKT2 amplification has been reported most frequently in endometrial cancer (3.7%), ovarian cancer (3.6%), cancer of unknown primary (CUP) (2.2%), pancreatic cancer (1.8%), head and neck cancer (1.6%), and bladder cancer (1.4%) (cBio_Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359). One study found AKT2 protein expression to be more common in hilar cholangiocarcinomas (54%) than peripheral cholangiocarcinomas (27%) (Guedj et al., 2009; 19446907). AKT expression was associated with favorable prognosis in cholangiocarcinoma (Javle et al., 2006; 16984600), while another study reported no prognosis relevance of pAKT in the intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (Schomitz et al., 2007, 18161916). Amplification or activation of AKT2 may promote AKT_mTOR pathway activation and may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of the AKT and downstream mTOR pathways. Clinical benefit has been achieved in 1 patient with AKT2 amplification treated with an mTOR inhibitor (Basho et al., 2017; 27893038). In preclinical studies, the AKT inhibitor MK_2206 showed evidence of enhancing anti_tumor activity of other chemotherapeutic agents in lung and ovarian tumor cells (Hirai et al., 2010; 20571069).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "AKT2 amplification or mutation may lead to AKT_mTOR pathway activation and may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04341259", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03239015", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04803318", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05125523", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03772561", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03297606", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04551521", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03673787", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT01582191", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03203525", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "ATM", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "L1524fs*7", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "0.09", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "L1524fs*7"}}, "Interpretation": "ATM encodes the protein ataxia telangiectasia mutated, which is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a key role in the DNA damage response (Shiloh and Ziv, 2013; 23847781). Loss of functional ATM promotes tumorigenesis (Cremona and Behrens, 2014; 23851492). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt ATM function or expression (Jiang et al., 2006; 16603769, Fernandes et al., 2005; 15713674, Scott et al., 2002; 11805335). ATM alterations have been observed in various solid tumors, with mutations being more frequent than gene loss and often seen in small bowel (7_9%), endometrial (7%), non_melanoma skin (3_6%), bladder (5%), hepatobiliary (4_5%), colorectal (4_5%), and lung (3%) cancer (cBio_Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359, Nguyen et al., 2022; 35120664). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of ATM alterations in biliary tract carcinoma are limited (PubMed, Feb 2022). Loss of functional ATM results in a defective DNA damage response and homologous recombination_mediated DNA repair and may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Michels et al., 2014; 24037533, Bryant and Helleday, 2006; 16556909). Clinical responses have been reported for patients with ATM_mutated prostate cancer treated with PARP inhibitors (Mateo et al., 2015; 26510020, Mateo et al., 2020; 31806540, de Bono et al., 2020; ASCO GU Abstract 119, Abida et al., 2020; 32086346) and PARP inhibitors have shown limited clinical benefit for patients with other ATM_mutated solid tumors including pancreatic cancer (Ma et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 563, Dhawan et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 3513), colorectal cancer (Ma et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 563, Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006, Papageorgiou et al., 2021; 35004311), papillary renal cell carcinoma (Olson et al., 2016; 27079472), ovarian cancer (Swisher et al., 2021; 33941784), small cell bowel cancer, (Dhawan et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 3513), and biliary tract cancer (Piha_Paul et al., 2018; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract A096, Zhang et al., 2020; 32045060). In Phase 1 trials of ATR inhibitors, a heavily pretreated patient with colorectal cancer who achieved a CR to berzosertib (O Carrigan et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2504) and 4 out of 4 patients with diverse solid tumors who achieved PRs to BAY1895344 (Yap et al., 2020; 32988960) harbored ATM inactivation or protein loss. In a Phase 2 study of a combination of the ATR inhibitor ceralasertib and durvalumab for patients with advanced gastric cancer, objective responses (ORs) were experienced by 50% (4/8) of patients with loss of ATM expression, compared with 14% (3/21) patients with intact ATM (Kwon et al., 2022; 35790315). Studies showing reduced cell viability and increased DNA damage in preclinical models of solid tumors (Menezes et al., 2015; 25232030, Vendetti et al., 2015; 26517239, Min et al., 2017; 28138034) and hematologic malignancies (Menezes et al., 2015; 25232030, Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132) also support the increased sensitivity of ATM_deficient cells to ATR inhibitors. Preclinical experiments also indicate that loss of ATM causes dependency on DNA_PKcs in cancer cells; DNA_PKcs inhibitors promoted apoptosis in ATM_deficient cells and were active in a lymphoma mouse model lacking ATM activity (Riabinska et al., 2013; 23761041). ATM mutation carriers have increased cancer risk, with female carriers displaying a 38% lifetime risk of breast cancer (van Os et al., 2016; 26662178). Biallelic mutations in ATM underlie the rare autosomal_recessive inherited disorder ataxia_telangiectasia (A_T), also referred to as genome instability or DNA damage response syndrome (Rothblum_Oviatt et al., 2016; 27884168). This disease is characterized by genomic instability, sensitivity to DNA_damaging agents, and increased risk of developing cancer (Shiloh and Ziv, 2013; 23847781, Rothblum_Oviatt et al., 2016; 27884168). The prevalence of A_T is estimated at 1:40,000 to 1:100,000 worldwide (Rothblum_Oviatt et al., 2016; 27884168). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of ATM is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors may detect nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Loss or inactivation of ATM may increase sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, ATR inhibitors, or DNA_PKcs inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04644068", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04123366", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03742895", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02264678", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04298008", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04298021", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05035745", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03772561", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02693535", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "CCNE1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "CCNE1 encodes the protein cyclin E1, which plays a role in the regulated transition from the G1 to S phase by binding to and activating cyclin_dependent protein kinase 2 (CDK2). It also has a direct role in initiation of replication and the maintenance of genomic stability (M\u00f6r\u00f6y and Geisen, 2004; 15147722). Amplification of chromosomal region 19q12_q13 has been demonstrated in many types of cancer, and CCNE1 is a well_studied gene within this amplicon (Leung et al., 2006; 16575401, Lin et al., 2000; 11156406). Increased copy number of CCNE1 is highly associated with overexpression of the cyclin E1 protein (Mayr et al., 2006; 16753589, Nakayama et al., 2010; 20336784). Cyclin E1 overexpression can lead to cell transformation as a result of an increase in cyclin E1 activity (Stamatakos et al., 2010; 21176227, M\u00f6r\u00f6y and Geisen, 2004; 15147722). In one study, CCNE1 amplification was observed 7% of in gallbladder samples (cBio_Narayan et al., 2018; 30427539). CCNE1 amplification has been reported in 1_2% of samples in published cholangiocarcinoma datasets (cBio_Lowery et al., 2018; 29848569, cBio_Sanchez_Vega et al., 2018; 29625050). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of CCNE1 alterations in biliary tract carcinoma are limited (PubMed, Mar 2022). There are no approved therapies that directly target CCNE1 alterations. Because amplification or overexpression of CCNE1 leads to increased genomic instability though the ATR_CHK1_WEE1 pathway (Lin et al., 2017; 28331049, Chen et al., 2018; 30181387) and cyclin E1 promotes cell cycle progression in a complex with CDK2 (M\u00f6r\u00f6y and Geisen, 2004; 15147722), clinical and preclinical studies have investigated inhibitors of CHK1, ATR, CDK2, and WEE1 as potential therapeutic approaches for tumors with CCNE1 activation. Clinical benefit has been reported for patients with recurrent high_grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) with CCNE1 amplification or expression in response to treatment with the CHK1 inhibitor prexasertib (Lee et al., 2018; 29361470). Studies of the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib observed PRs in patients with CCNE1_amplified HGSOC and ovarian cancer (Lheureux et al., 2021; 33485453, Oza et al., 2020; 32611648). Similarly, in a Phase 2 study of patients with CCNE1_amplified solid tumors, adavosertib elicited an ORR of 26% with PRs reported for patients with ovarian cancer, urothelial carcinoma, or melanoma (Fu et al., 2021; AACR abstract 974). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that cell lines with CCNE1 amplification or overexpression were sensitive to inhibitors of ATR (Toledo et al., 2011; 21552262, Buisson et al., 2015; 26365377), CDK2 (Yang et al., 2015; 26204491), or WEE1 (Kok et al., 2020; 33028815, Chen et al., 2018; 30181387). However, other studies have shown that sensitivity of various cell lines to CDK2 inhibitors, including SNS_032, dinaciclib, and seliciclib, at clinically achievable doses, is largely independent of CCNE1 copy number or expression (Taylor_Harding et al., 2015; 25557169, Etemadmoghadam et al., 2013; 24004674, Scaltriti et al., 2011; 21321214, Nanos_Webb et al., 2012; 21695458). One study has reported a reduction in tumor CCNE1 levels in 4/6 lung and esophageal cancer cases following treatment with the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat (Ma et al., 2013; 23686769).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Strong preclinical and clinical data suggest that CCNE1 amplification may predict sensitivity to WEE1 inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04768868", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05128825", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03968653", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05109975", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Blood Tumor Mutational Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "08", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "08"}}, "Interpretation": "Blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations from circulating tumor DNA in blood.

High bTMB levels were not detected in this sample. It is unclear whether the bTMB levels in this sample would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Depending on the clinical context, TMB testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. Average bTMB levels in solid tumors other than NSCLC have not been evaluated (PubMed, Mar 2022). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of bTMB levels in biliary tract cancer are limited (PubMed, Jul 2022). Although cases with hypermutated biliary tract cancer were enriched in a subgroup with poor prognosis in 1 study (Nakamura et al., 2015; 26258846), TMB_high (\u226510 mut/Mb) status in biliary adenocarcinoma not treated with immunotherapy was not significantly associated with OS in another study, in which patients with TMB_high tumors experienced numerically longer OS compared with patients with TMB_low tumors (11.5 vs. 8.4 months, adjusted HR=0.65) (Shao et al., 2020; 33119110). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB) may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716), anti_PD_1 (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716), anti_PD_1/CTLA4 therapies (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P), anti_PD_L1/CTLA4 therapies (Chen et al., 2020; 32379280, Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511, Rizvi et al., 2020; 32271377, Si et al., 2021; 33355200, Leighl et al., 2022; 34800700). A Phase 2 multi_solid_tumor trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022). In non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single_agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 Muts/Mb_16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2020; 32271377, Si et al., 2021; 33355200, Leighl et al., 2022; 34800700). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511). In colorectal cancer (CRC), a Phase 2 study showed that bTMB TMB \u226528 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u226514 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved OS from a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61, Chen et al., 2020; 32379280).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "CASP8", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "G20fs*18", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "69.52", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "G20fs*18"}}, "Interpretation": "CASP8 encodes caspase_8, a multifunctional protein that mediates apoptosis (Galluzzi et al., 2016; 26885855, Tummers and Green, 2017; 28462525, Crowder and El_Deiry, 2012; 23070000, Liu et al., 2011; 21801448), cell motility (Graf et al., 2014; 24467204, Barbero et al., 2009; 19383910), and cell signaling, including through the NFkB (Zhang et al., 2015; 25446254, Su et al., 2005; 15746428, Henry and Martin, 2017; 28212752) and MAPK (Kober et al., 2011; 21975294, Sun et al., 2011; 21152872) pathways. The role of CASP8 in cancer is complex and context_dependent, with diverse cancer types exhibiting either overexpression or loss of expression. CASP8 mutations found in the context of cancer tend to be truncating or missense mutations; most of the characterized mutations impair apoptosis (Soung et al., 2005; 15705878, Soung et al., 2005; 15531912, Mandruzzato et al., 1997; 9271594, Kim et al., 2003; 12949717, Li et al., 2014; 24816188) and promote NFkB activation (Ando et al., 2013; 23659359). CASP8 mutations have been observed across solid tumors (cBio_Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359), including 8.2% of head and neck squamous cell (cBio_Cancer Genome Atlas, 2015; 25631445), 3.2% of colorectal (cBio_Yaeger et al., 2018; 29316426), and 4% of cervical (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2017; 28112728) carcinoma cases. Reduced expression of CASP8 has been associated with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer (Hernandez et al., 2015; 28179987), prostate cancer (Rodriguez_Berriguete et al., 2015; 26507126), and medulloblastoma (Pingoud_Meier et al., 2003; 14695141). There are no targeted approaches to directly address alterations in CASP8.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "DNMT3A", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "E463fs*188", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "1.07", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "E463fs*188"}}, "Interpretation": "The DNMT3A gene encodes the protein DNA methyltransferase 3A, an enzyme that is involved in the methylation of newly synthesized DNA, a function critical for gene regulation (Trowbridge and Orkin, 2012; 22200773, Ch\u00e9din, 2011; 21507354). The role of DNMT3A in cancer is uncertain, as some reports describe increased expression and contribution to tumor growth, whereas others propose a role for DNMT3A as a tumor suppressor (Yang et al., 2011; 21887466, Vallb\u00f6hmer et al., 2006; 16870044, Daskalos et al., 2011; 21351083, Fabbri et al., 2007; 17890317, Gao et al., 2011; 22011581, Kim et al., 2013; 23031157). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt DNMT3A function or expression (Chen et al., 2005; 15861382, Guo et al., 2015; 25383530, Sandoval et al., 2019; 30705090, Zhang et al., 2018; 29414941). DNMT3A alterations have been reported at relatively low frequencies in solid tumors and are more prevalent in hematological malignancies (cBioPortal, Feb 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of DNMT3A alterations in solid tumors are limited (PubMed, Feb 2022). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in DNMT3A in solid tumors. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI_H has been variously reported in 0_42% of gallbladder carcinomas (Moy et al., 2015; 25680569, Mishra et al., 2009; 19866438, Nagahashi et al., 2008; 18176964, Saetta et al., 2006; 15963980, Roa et al., 2005; 15692793, Sessa et al., 2003; 12766614, Rashid et al., 2002; 12374683). MSI_H is infrequent in cholangiocarcinoma, reported in 1% of samples (Javle et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 4087). A non_zero level of MSI has been reported in 18_49% of cholangiocarcinoma cases (Momoi et al., 2001; 11580146, Limpaiboon et al., 2002; 12175538, Liu et al., 2002; 12402306, Liengswangwong et al., 2003; 14506736), although the studies did not specify what fraction of cases were MSI_H. A higher frequency of MSI (63%) was reported in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma associated with exposure to Thorotrast (Liu et al., 2002; 12402306). No significant difference in median overall survival or prognosis was found in MSI_H gallbladder carcinomas when compared to MSS cases (Moy et al., 2015; 25680569, Roa et al., 2005; 15692793, Rashid et al., 2002; 12374683). One study reported that MSI is associated with poor prognosis in liver fluke_related cholangiocarcinoma (Limpaiboon et al., 2002; 12175538). On the basis of prospective clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD_1_targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Shitara et al., 2022; 35322232, Andre et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 244, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143), as well as PD_L1_targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92).

RB1 mutations have been reported across solid tumors including small cell lung cancer (60%), bladder (13%), uterine sarcoma (10%), non_melanoma skin cancer (9.5%), and gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors (9.3%) (Nguyen et al., 2022; 35120664). The prognostic significance of RB1 mutation in gallbladder carcinoma has not been extensively studied (PubMed, Jul 2022). On the basis of limited clinical data (Owonikoko et al., 2016; ESMO Abstract 14230) and strong preclinical data (Hook et al., 2012; 22222631, Gong et al., 2019; 30373917, Oser et al., 2019; 30373918, Yang et al., 2022; 34741392), RB1 inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to inhibitors of Aurora kinase A, particularly in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). A clinical study evaluating the Aurora kinase A inhibitor alisertib for patients with prostate cancer did not find an association between RB1 deletion and clinical benefit (Beltran et al., 2019; 30232224). Other approaches to target RB1 inactivation under investigation in preclinical studies include inhibitors of BCL_2 family members (Allaman_Pillet et al., 2013; 21955141) and activation of the NOTCH pathway (Viatour et al., 2011; 21875955). Mutations in RB1 underlie the development of retinoblastoma (RB), a rare tumor that arises at a rate of approximately 1:20,000 live births, with nearly 5,000 new cases worldwide per year (Chen et al., 2014; 24282159). Germline mutations in RB1 account for approximately 40% of RB tumors (Yun et al., 2011; 22553621) and are associated with an increased risk of developing secondary malignancies that include soft tissue and bone sarcoma and malignant melanoma (Houston et al., 2011; 21139478, Ng et al., 2010; 19959033).

Inactivation of p53, through mutation, deletion, or loss of heterozygosity (LOH), has been observed in 25_63% of gallbladder carcinomas and 10_61% of cholangiocarcinomas (Li et al., 2014; 24997986, Ross et al., 2014; 24563076, Jiao et al., 2013; 24185509, Chan_On et al., 2013; 24185513, Borger et al., 2012; 22180306, Suto et al., 2000; 10738270, Ong et al., 2012; 22561520, Javle et al., 2016; 27622582, Nakamura et al., 2015; 26258846, Nault and Zucman_Rossi, 2011; 21538283). TP53 mutations occur more frequently in tumors caused by liver fluke (O. viverrini) infection (40%) than in cholangiocarcinoma cases not related to infection (9%) (Chan_On et al., 2013; 24185513). TP53 alteration and inactivation were shown to be early and common events in gallbladder carcinogenesis (Moreno et al., 2005; 16177659). Aberrant TP53 expression, which is indicative of TP53 dysregulation, has been observed in 20\u201362% of gallbladder carcinomas and 25% (5/20) of cholangiocarcinomas (Won et al., 2010; 20955617, Chaube et al., 2006; 16686942, Chuang et al., 2004; 15573254). Data regarding the prognostic significance of TP53 mutation in cholangiocarcinoma are conflicting (Ruzzenente et al., 2016; 26717940, Xiaofang et al., 2012; 22230750, Ajiki et al., 1996; 8799388, Saetta, 2006; 16724348, Guo et al., 2014; 24746206, Boerner et al., 2021; 33765338, Conci et al., 2020; 32020551, Simbolo et al., 2018; 29740198, Churi et al., 2014; 25536104). Overexpression of p53 protein has been associated with reduced patient survival in poorly differentiated gallbladder adenocarcinomas and biliary tract cancers (Lee and Pirdas, 1995; 7567135, Ahrendt et al., 2000; 11180865); however, another study did not find such a correlation (Ajiki et al., 1996; 8799388). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838).

A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Fraction", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor fraction provides an estimate of the percentage of ctDNA present in a cell_free DNA (cfDNA) sample. The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with elevated tumor fraction have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus high sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at low risk of false negative results. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels. In the research setting, changes in tumor fraction estimates have been associated with treatment duration and clinical response and may be a useful indicator for future cancer management (Bronkhorst
