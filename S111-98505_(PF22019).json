AKT activation promotes cell survival via inhibition of apoptosis and also contributes to cell proliferation through several interactions with the cell cycle machinery; inappropriate activation of AKT can therefore lead to tumor formation (Vivanco and Sawyers, 2002; 12094235). Missense mutations and in_frame duplications that occur in the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of AKT1, as seen here, have been shown to transform cells and activate AKT signaling and are therefore considered to be oncogenic (Bessiere et al., 2015; 26137586, Auguste et al., 2015; 26362254, Chang et al., 2017; 29247016, Yeh et al., 2019; 31527710, Parikh et al., 2012; 23134728, Calleja et al., 2009; 19166270, Askham et al., 2010; 19802009). AKT1 mutation has been reported in 11.5% of meningioma samples analyzed (COSMIC, Mar 2021)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). The AKT1 E17K mutation has been reported to occur mainly in Grade 1 meningiomas, and only rarely in Grades 2 or 3, cited in 7_11% of Grade 1 cases (Sahm et al., 2013; 24096618, Brastianos et al., 2013; 23334667). AKT1 E17K mutations have been shown to be mutually exclusive with NF2 mutations in meningiomas (Brastianos et al., 2013; 23334667). Increased AKT1 activity has also been detected in meningiomas, with one study identifying AKT1 activity (p_AKT) in 45% and 8% of anaplastic and atypical meningiomas, respectively, as compared to 5% in benign meningioma tissue (Mawrin et al., 2005; 15930342, Johnson et al., 2009; 19034385). AKT1 E17K was associated with shorter time to recurrence for patients with meningioma when compared with wildtype AKT1 tumors (P=0.046) (Yesiloz et al., 2017; 28482067). Mutations that activate AKT1 may predict activity of AKT1 inhibitors in various tumor types. Phase 3 trials of AKT inhibitor combination treatments for patients with advanced breast cancer (capivasertib) and prostate cancer (ipatasertib) are furthest in development (Smyth et al., 2020; 32312891, Schmid et al., 2020; SABCS Abstract PD1_11, De Bono et al., 2021; ASCO GU Abstract 13), and basket trials have also shown responses in a variety of other solid tumors (Hyman et al., 2017; 28489509, Kalinsky et al., 2020; 33377972). An NCI_MATCH subprotocol of capivasertib for patients with breast cancer (18 patients) and other tumor types (17 patients) reported an ORR of 29% (10/35) with 1 CR experienced by a patient with endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma and PRs experienced by 7 patients with breast cancer, 1 patient with uterine leiomyosarcoma, and 1 patient with oncocytic carcinoma of the parotid gland (Kalinsky et al., 2020; 33377972). A patient with AKT1 E17K mutation_positive meningothelial meningioma treated with capivasertib experienced stable disease and a minor radiographic response lasting over 1 year (Weller et al., 2017; 28376212). On the basis of clinical data in solid tumors, AKT1 activating mutations may be sensitive to mTOR inhibitors such as everolimus and temsirolimus (Tredan et al., 2013; 23238879, Aghajanian et al., 2018; 29804638, Schneider et al., 2017; 27870581, Bryce et al., 2017; 28423702, Wheler et al., 2013; 23765114). In an exploratory analysis, a study for patients with AKT1_mutated hormone_receptor_positive (HR+), HER2_negative breast cancer treated with the investigational ATP_competitive MTOR_inhibitor sapanisertib and exemestane or fulvestrant reported a positive association between best overall response (CR+PR) and AKT1_mutated status (n=11) compared with patients with AKT1_wildtype status (n=42) (p<0.03) (Lim et al., 2021; 33820779). In a retrospective analysis of clinical outcomes for patients with HR+ breast cancer, AKT1 E17K was associated with significantly increased median duration of treatment with everolimus_containing regimens (Smyth et al., 2020; 31924700).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "AKT1 amplification or mutation may lead to activation of AKT signaling and therefore may result in sensitivity to AKT pathway inhibitors.

Individual patients with AKT1_mutated endometrial cancer (Tredan et al., 2013; 23238879, Aghajanian et al., 2018; 29804638), papillary thyroid cancer (Schneider et al., 2017; 27870581), ovarian cancer (Bryce et al., 2017; 28423702), or thymoma (Wheler et al., 2013; 23765114) have achieved objective response or disease control with mTOR inhibitor treatment. </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> Clinical data on the efficacy of temsirolimus for the treatment of meningioma are limited (PubMed, Oct 2021). A Phase 1 trial of bevacizumab and temsirolimus plus liposomal doxorubicin in patients with advanced solid tumors showed that the combination was well tolerated and resulted in six_month SD in 21% of patients, with a 21% rate of partial or complete remission (Moroney et al., 2012; 22927482). In a Phase 2 clinical trial in non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), temsirolimus showed clinical benefit, but further studies are warranted (Reungwetwattana et al., 2012; 22722792). A Phase 2 study of temsirolimus in patients with KRAS_mutant colorectal cancer reported limited efficacy; however, all patients who exhibited tumor reduction were found to have low levels of mutated KRAS in plasma samples (Spindler et al., 2013; 23514584). A Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with pancreatic cancer reported that temsirolimus monotherapy had limited efficacy, and may have contributed to disease progression (Javle et al., 2010; 20630061). A study examining the efficacy of temsirolimus_involving regimens in 24 patients with mesenchymal/metaplastic breast cancer (MpBCs) reported 2 CRs, 4 PRs, 2 instances of SD longer than 6 months, and 4 instances of SD shorter than 6 months (Moulder et al., 2015; 25878190). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Everolimus", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Everolimus is an orally available mTOR inhibitor that is FDA approved to treat renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following antiangiogenic therapy; pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors; and well_differentiated non_functional neuroendocrine tumors of the lung or gastrointestinal tract.

A study of 3 patients with NF2 meningioma treated with everolimus reported no responses or progressive disease (Osorio et al., 2015; doi:10.1093/neuonc/nov061.158). A preclinical study reported that everolimus and temsirolimus both inhibited meningioma cell growth and resulted in a 70% decrease in tumor growth in orthotopic and subcutaneous xenograft mouse models (Pachow et al., 2013; 23406776). Other preclinical studies of meningioma cells in vitro have shown that everolimus synergized with octreotide to inhibit cell proliferation and reduce cell viability (Graillon et al., 2015; 26015296, Tan et al., 2014; 24800949). Whereas frequent adverse events precluded a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for the combination of trametinib and everolimus in a Phase 1b trial for solid tumors (Tolcher et al., 2014; 25344362), a retrospective study for heavily pretreated patients with solid tumors reported tolerable regimens of the combination for 23/31 patients, with 16 patients treated >3 months and evaluable patients achieving a median PFS of 6.5 months (Patterson et al., 2018; AACR Abstract 3891). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04589845", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03239015", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04337463", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04803318", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03772561", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04632992", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03994796", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03673787", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03065062", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03217669", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "MUTYH", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "splice site 892_2A>G", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "splice site 892_2A>G"}}, "Interpretation": "MUTYH (also known as MYH) encodes an enzyme involved in DNA base excision repair, and loss of function mutations in MUTYH result in increased rates of mutagenesis and promotion of tumorigenesis (David et al., 2007; 17581577). The two most frequently reported MUTYH loss of function mutations are G382D (also referred to as G396D) and Y165C (also referred to as Y179C) (Molatore et al., 2010; 19953527, Kundu et al., 2009; 19836313, D Agostino et al., 2010; 20418187, Hegde et al., 2014; 24310308, Aretz et al., 2013; 22872101). Numerous other MUTYH mutations have also been shown to result in loss of function (Molatore et al., 2010; 19953527, Kundu et al., 2009; 19836313, Ali et al., 2008; 18534194, D Agostino et al., 2010; 20418187). In general, somatic MUTYH mutations are infrequently reported across cancer types (COSMIC, 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Monoallelic MUTYH mutation occurs in 1_2% of the general population (Hegde et al., 2014; 24310308, Aretz et al., 2013; 22872101). There is conflicting data regarding the impact of monoallelic mutations on the risk of developing CRC (Win et al., 2014; 24444654, Lubbe et al., 2009; 19620482, Jones et al., 2009; 19394335). Patients with MUTYH_mutant CRC were reported to have significantly improved overall survival compared to patients without MUTYH mutation (Nielsen et al., 2010; 21044966). There are no therapies or clinical trials available to address MUTYH alterations in cancer. One or more of the MUTYH variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with MUTYH_associated polyposis (ClinVar, Sep 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline biallelic MUTYH mutation causes MUTYH_associated polyposis (also known as MYH_associated polyposis or MAP), an autosomal recessive condition characterized by multiple colorectal adenomas and increased lifetime risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) (Hegde et al., 2014; 24310308, Sampson et al., 2003; 12853198, Sieber et al., 2003; 12606733, Al_Tassan et al., 2002; 11818965). MAP accounts for approximately 0.7% of all CRC cases and 2% of early_onset CRC cases (Hegde et al., 2014; 24310308). In contrast to CRC, the role of MUTYH mutation in the context of other cancer types is not well established (Rennert et al., 2012; 21952991, Zhang et al., 2006; 16492928, von der Th\u00fcsen et al., 2011; 21189386, Casper et al., 2014; 24420788, Smith et al., 2009; 20110747). Estimates for the prevalence of MAP in the general population range from 1:5,000_1:10,000 (Aretz et al., 2013; 22872101). Therefore, in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of MUTYH is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). The reported incidence of MSI in meningioma has varied significantly between studies (Pykett et al., 1994; 7987826, Alvino et al., 2000; 11045018, Simon et al., 1996; 8875241, Zhu et al., 1996; 8622857, Pecina_Slaus et al., 2016; 27630299, Chen et al., 2012; 22930430, Pecina_Slaus et al., 2017; 28705114). The prognostic significance of MSI in meningioma is unknown (PubMed, Aug 2021). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "00", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "00"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB level associated with lower rates of clinical benefit from treatment with PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors compared with patients with tumors harboring higher TMB levels, based on several studies in multiple solid tumor types (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). Meningioma harbors a median TMB of 1.8 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 0.9% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). Grade 2 or 3 meningiomas have been associated with a higher mutation rate than Grade 1 meningiomas; meningiomas were reported to have a smaller number of somatic alterations relative to other tumor types (Brastianos et al., 2013; 23334667). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, higher TMB has been reported to be associated with increased ORR and OS from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). Higher TMB was found to be significantly associated with improved OS upon immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment for patients with 9 types of advanced tumors (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254). Analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy, compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386). However, the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors found significant improvement in ORR for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (based on this assay or others) compared to those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb, in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types; similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). Together, these studies suggest that patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb may derive clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1 inhibitors.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "AKT1", "Alteration": "E17K", "Title": "Tumor_Agnostic Precision Immuno_Oncology and Somatic Targeting Rational for You (TAPISTRY) Platform Study", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "TRKB, ALK, TRKC, ROS1, TRKA, RET, PD_L1, AKTs, ERBB2, MDM2, PI3K_alpha", "Locations": "Zhongzheng Dist.
