The BARD1 ANK repeats and BRCT motifs play important roles in chromosome stability, and both these regions and the RING domain are necessary for homology_directed repair (Laufer et al., 2007; 17848578, Wu et al., 2015; 25634209, Westermark et al., 2003; 14560035). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt BARD1 function or expression. In the TCGA datasets, BARD1 mutation or loss was reported in 4% of lung squamous cell carcinomas and in 1.3% of lung adenocarcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552). Some BARD1 mutations have been reported to be associated with non_small cell lung cancer development and poor prognosis (Zhang et al., 2012; 21815143). Clinical benefit from rucaparib has been observed in a patient with BARD1_mutated ovarian cancer (O Malley et al., 2017; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract LB_A12). On the basis of preclinical evidence, tumors with BARD1 inactivation may be sensitive to PARP inhibitors (Wu et al., 2015; 25634209, Wang et al., 2016; 27454289, Ozden et al., 2016; 27197561, Nguyen et al., 2017; AACR Abstract 2476, Zhao et al., 2017; 28976962).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Tumors with BARD1 inactivating mutation or loss may be sensitive to PARP inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04380636", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04123366", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03742895", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03739710", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02264678", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04635631", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03772561", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04550494", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04497116", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "EGFR", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "exon 19 deletion (E746_A750del)", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "exon 19 deletion (E746_A750del)"}}, "Interpretation": "EGFR encodes the epidermal growth factor receptor, which belongs to a class of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases. In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations, such as seen here, have been shown to activate the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR and to confer sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib, gefitinib (Lynch et al., 2004; 15118073, Paez et al., 2004; 15118125, Pao et al., 2004; 15329413), afatinib (Yang et al., 2015; 25589191), osimertinib (Soria et al., 2018; 29151359), and dacomitinib (Wu et al., 2017; 28958502, Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), although limited preclinical data suggest reduced sensitivity to lapatinib (Gilmer et al., 2008; 18199554, Foster et al., 2016; 26996308). EGFR mutation has been reported in 12_36% of lung adenocarcinomas (Vallee et al., 2013; 23934203, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552) and in 4% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745). EGFR protein expression/overexpression has been reported in up to 70% of NSCLC cases (Watzka et al., 2010; 20353893, Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Grob et al., 2013; 23238037, Park et al., 2012; 22207554, Dobashi et al., 2011; 21040950, Ludovini et al., 2013; 23314677). In addition, expression of EGFR protein has been shown to be higher in lung squamous cell carcinoma samples as compared to lung adenocarcinoma (Skrzypski et al., 2013; 23870818, Kim et al., 2012; 22419022). In patients with lung adenocarcinoma, EGFR mutation was a predictor of poor overall survival (Lee et al., 2013; 23525704, Oakley and Chiosea, 2011; 21587084). However, EGFR mutations have been reported to predict improved survival in patients with resected Stage 1_3 lung adenocarcinoma (Marks et al., 2008; 18303429) or resected Stage 1 NSCLC (Izar et al., 2013; 23932319). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer, EGFR activating mutations may predict sensitivity to EGFR TKIs, including erlotinib (Rosell et al., 2011; 22285168), gefitinib (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064), afatinib (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960), dacomitinib (Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), and osimertinib (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549); however, the data for patients with other tumor types are limited (Hong et al., 2020; 32749686, Kim et al., 2015; 26462025, Kim et al., 2015; 25424851, Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840, Cavalieri et al., 2018; 29734047, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Audet et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 6041). The Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study of amivantamab monotherapy or in combination with lazertinib for the treatment of EGFR_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has produced encouraging preliminary results for treatment_naive patients and patients who relapsed after treatment with osimertinib, including osimertinib_relapsed patients with biomarkers indicating EGFR/MET_based osimertinib resistance (Haura et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9009, Cho et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 1258O, Bauml et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9006). In a Phase 1 trial, the HER3_targeted antibody patritumab deruxtecan elicited an ORR of 39% (22/57, 1 CR) and a median PFS of 8.2 months for patients with non_small cell lung cancer previously treated with an EGFR TKI, many of whom displayed TKI resistance alterations (Janne et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9007). A Phase 1 trial evaluating the EGFR inhibitor AZD3759 reported a reduction in the volume of brain metastases in 40% (8/20) of patients with previously treated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring either the EGFR L858R alteration or EGFR exon 19 deletion, including 3 confirmed PRs and 3 unconfirmed PRs (Ahn et al., 2017; 29056570, Yang et al., 2016; 27928026). In a Phase 1/2 trial for advanced NSCLC, the brain_penetrant third_generation EGFR TKI lazertinib enabled ORRs of 54% (69/127) for all evaluable patients and 44% (8/18, intracranial) for patients with brain metastases (Ahn et al., 2019; 31587882). The Phase 3 IMpower150 study showed that the addition of atezolizumab to bevacizumab plus chemotherapy treatment also had clinical efficacy for patients with EGFR_mutated or ALK_rearranged metastatic NSCLC (Socinski et al., 2018; 29863955); therefore, the patient\u2019s clinical context should be considered. For patients with NSCLC treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, PIK3CA mutation is associated with shorter OS in a meta_analysis (pooled HR of 1.83) (Chen et al., 2015; 26175928). Clinical studies of lung cancer have shown that acquired PIK3CA mutation may confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors like osimertinib (Schoenfeld et al., 2020; 31911548, Ramalingam et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract LBA50, Papadimitrakopoulou et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract LBA51).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

Gefitinib achieved an ORR of 69.8% and an OS of 19.2 months as first_line treatment for Caucasian patients with non_small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and EGFR sensitizing mutations (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064). In the retrospective analysis of a Phase 3 study for East Asian patients, gefitinib was reported to have a longer PFS for patients with EGFR mutation_positive NSCLC compared with carboplatin/paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy (Fukuoka et al., 2011; 21670455, Mok et al., 2009; 19692680). Two Phase 3 trials of gefitinib plus pemetrexed and carboplatin compared with gefitinib alone for patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR activating mutations reported significantly higher ORRs (75.3% and 84% vs. 62.5% and 67%), longer median PFSs (16 and 20.9 months vs. 8 and 11.9 months), and longer median OSs (50.9 months and not reached vs. 17 and 38.8 months) with combination treatment; however, combination treatment was associated with increased Grade 3 or higher adverse events (Noronha et al., 2019; 31411950, Hosomi et al., 2020; 31682542). Retrospective analysis of East Asian patients with advanced NSCLC receiving first_line gefitinib therapy reported that patients with EGFR exon 19 mutations experienced a longer median PFS (10.9 months) compared with patients with EGFR mutations in exon 18 (7.9 months), exon 20 (1.2 months), exon 21 (7.7 months), or double mutations (5.7 months); however, no differences in OS were seen between EGFR mutations (Sutiman et al., 2017; 27908825).

Meta_analysis of studies comparing erlotinib or gefitinib versus chemotherapy in the first_line setting reported no significant improvement in OS for patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC; however, the lack of improved OS was attributed to the effectiveness of postprogression salvage therapy (Lee et al., 2017; 28376144).

Patients with metastatic NSCLC and common EGFR mutations who progressed on prior chemotherapy experienced an ORR of 50.0% (30/60) from afatinib in a Phase 4 trial (Thongprasert et al., 2019; 31807143). As first_line therapy for NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletions or L858R, prospective or randomized Phase 2 trials have reported a median PFS of 10.2 months and OS of 24.8 months for patients unfit for chemotherapy (Januszewski et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.13_17) and an ORR of 72.5% (n=40, 1 CR), DCR of 100% (40/40), and median PFS and OS of 15.2 and 30.0 months, respectively, for elderly patients \u226570 years old (Suzuki et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_92). A retrospective study of afatinib administered to Asian patients with NSCLC, 99% of whom were previously treated with erlotinib and/or gefitinib, reported an ORR of 27.4% (63/230) for patients with common sensitizing EGFR mutations and an ORR of 24.4% (105/431) for the entire cohort (Chang et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_11). In a case report, a patient with NSCLC with exon 19 deletion and leptomeningeal metastases experienced an ongoing 16_month PR from afatinib in extracranial, brain, and leptomeningeal lesions (Llin\u00e1s_Quintero et al., 2019; 31637072). For patients with erlotinib_ or gefitinib_resistant NSCLC and EGFR mutations, Phase 2/3 studies of afatinib treatment have generally reported ORRs of only 7 to 9% (Miller et al., 2012; 22452896, Chen et al., 2013; 23664448, Katakami et al., 2013; 23816963, Landi et al., 2014; 25242668, De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2015; 25682316, Yang et al., 2015; 26051236); however, DCRs of more than 50% have been observed (De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2015; 25682316). In a Phase 1b or observational study, patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC who progressed on afatinib experienced further clinical benefit from subsequent treatment with afatinib and cetuximab (Horn et al., 2017; 29110849) or osimertinib (Yamamoto et al., 2020; 31863283), respectively. Extensive clinical data have demonstrated that afatinib is effective for patients with EGFR_mutated advanced NSCLC, including exon 19 deletions and L858 mutations, as well as uncommon sensitizing mutations in exons 18 or 20 (Januszewski et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.13_17, Chang et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_11, Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960, Wu et al., 2014; 24439929, Yang et al., 2015; 25589191, Soria et al., 2015; 26156651, Paz_Ares et al., 2017; 28426106). Afatinib has also shown activity for patients with advanced NSCLC and ERBB2 mutations, most of which were exon 20 insertions (Dziadziuszko et al., 2019; 30825613, Lai et al., 2019; 30685684, Greulich et al., 2012; 22908275, Gow et al., 2015; 26134234, Mazi\u00e8res et al., 2016; 26598547, Mazi\u00e8res et al., 2013; 23610105, De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2015; 25682316, De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2012; 22325357, Li et al., 2015; 26559459, Costa et al., 2016; 26964772, Yuan et al., 2020; 32477948, Fang et al., 2019; 31748336). The randomized Phase 3 LUX_Lung 8 trial comparing afatinib with erlotinib as second_line therapy for advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) reported significantly longer median OS (7.9 vs. 6.8 months, HR=0.81), significantly longer median PFS (2.6 vs. 1.9 months, HR=0.81), and higher DCR (51% vs. 40%, p=0.002) for patients treated with afatinib (Soria et al., 2015; 26156651). For patients who progressed on afatinib monotherapy, additional clinical benefit has been reported from afatinib combined with paclitaxel (Schuler et al., 2016; 26646759). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Osimertinib", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Osimertinib is an irreversible EGFR TKI that is selective for EGFR TKI_sensitizing mutations and the EGFR T790M mutation.

In the Phase 3 ADAURA study, patients with early Stage (IB/II/IIIA) EGFR_mutated NSCLC experienced longer PFSs on osimertinib compared to placebo in the adjuvant setting (not reached vs. 28.1 months; HR=0.21)(Herbst et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract LBA5).

The PI3K pathway is involved in cell signaling that regulates a number of critical cellular functions, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival (Samuels et al., 2005; 15950905, Engelman, 2009; 19629070). PIK3CA alterations that have been characterized as activating, such as observed here, are predicted to be oncogenic (Kang et al., 2005; 15647370, Ikenoue et al., 2005; 15930273, Gymnopoulos et al., 2007; 17376864, Horn et al., 2008; 18317450, Rudd et al., 2011; 21266528, Hon et al., 2012; 22120714, Burke et al., 2012; 22949682, Wu et al., 2009; 19915146, Dbouk et al., 2010; 2103068, Dan et al., 2010; 20530683, Oda et al., 2008; 18829572, Zhao and Vogt, 2008; 18794883, Lui et al., 2013; 23619167, Ross et al., 2013; 22430209, Riviere et al., 2012; 22729224, Shibata et al., 2009; 19394761, Droguluk et al., 2015; 26627007,Croessmann et al., 2018; 29284706, Ng et al., 2018; 29533785, Spangle et al., 2020; 32929011, Chen et al., 2018; 29636477). In the TCGA datasets, PIK3CA mutation was observed in 8.2% of lung adenocarcinoma cases (cBio_Campbell et al., 2016; 27158780) and in 15.7% of lung squamous cell carcinoma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745). Studies have observed PIK3CA amplification and mutation to be far more frequent in lung squamous cell carcinomas than in lung adenocarcinomas, with amplification reported in 34_42% of the former (Spoerke et al., 2012; 23136191, Wang et al., 2013; 23335533, Ji et al., 2011; 21507233, Massion et al., 2002; 12097266). The prognostic significance of PIK3CA mutation or overexpression in NSCLC is unclear, with several studies reporting contradictory data, which may be influenced by the specific PIK3CA mutation, histologic subtype, and the presence of concurrent mutations in oncogenes such as EGFR and KRAS (Zhao et al., 2014; 24328409, Eng et al., 2015; 26334752, Song et al., 2016; 27554588, Zhang et al., 2013; 23674897, McGowan et al., 2017; 28024696, Wang et al., 2015; 26107237). Clinical and preclinical data in various tumor types indicate that PIK3CA activating alterations may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting PI3K (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574, Juric et al., 2018; 29401002, Gallant et al., 2019; 30793038), AKT (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Smyth et al., 2021; 33863913), or mTOR (Park et al., 2016; 27105424, Lim et al., 2016; 26859683, Hou et al., 2014; 25426553, Varnier et al., 2019; 31351267, Janku et al., 2014; 24440717, Moroney et al., 2012; 22927482, Basho et al., 2017; 27893038, Moroney et al., 2011; 21890452). A Phase 2 study of buparlisib in NSCLC observed 2 PRs (3.2%; 2/63) in PIK3CA_pathway activated tumors, although the study did not meet its primary endpoint (Vansteenkiste et al., 2015; 26098748). Activating mutations in PIK3CA may confer resistance to HER2_targeted therapies; combined inhibition of HER2 and the PI3K pathway may be required in HER2_positive tumors with PIK3CA mutation (Esteva et al., 2010; 20813970, Baselga et al., 2014; 25332247, Chakrabarty et al., 2010; 20581867, Cizkova et al., 2010; San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium Abstract P2_09_30, Kataoka et al., 2010; 19633047, Wang et al., 2011; 21676217). For patients with NSCLC treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, PIK3CA mutation is associated with shorter OS in a meta_analysis (pooled HR of 1.83) (Chen et al., 2015; 26175928). Clinical studies of lung cancer have shown that acquired PIK3CA mutation may confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors like osimertinib (Schoenfeld et al., 2020; 31911548, Ramalingam et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract LBA50, Papadimitrakopoulou et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract LBA51).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PIK3CA activating mutations may lead to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may therefore indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.

High bTMB levels were not detected in this sample. It is unclear whether the bTMB levels in this sample would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Depending on the clinical context, TMB testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. NSCLC harbors a median bTMB of 16.8 Muts/Mb (range 1.9_52.5 Muts/Mb)(Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950). Retrospective analysis of the Phase 3 OAK and Phase 2 POPLAR trials for patients with advanced or metastatic non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) reported that bTMB \u22657 Muts/Mb was associated with shorter PFS (2.8 vs. 4.2 months) and OS (7.4 vs. 11.9 months) compared with bTMB <7 Muts/Mb for patients treated with docetaxel (Nie et al., 2020; 32380463). In one study of advanced NSCLC in China, bTMB \u22656 Muts/Mb was associated with decreased PFS (10 vs. 18 months) and OS (11 vs. 25 months) compared with bTMB <6 Muts/Mb for patients treated with platinum_based chemotherapy (Ma et al., 2021; 34055609). A large study of Chinese patients with lung adenocarcinoma reported a shorter median OS for tumors with a higher number of mutations in a limited gene set compared with a lower mutation number (48.4 vs. 61.0 months)(Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843). Another study of patients with NSCLC correlated elevated TMB with poorer prognosis and significantly associated lower TMB in combination with PD_L1 negative status with longer median survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). However, no significant prognostic association of TMB and/or PD_L1 status with survival has been reported in patients with lung SCC (Yu et al., 2019; 30253973, Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). On the basis of clinical evidence in NSCLC and HSNCC, increased bTMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511) and anti_PD_1 (Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074) therapies. In NSCLC, multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 to 16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). In HNSCC, a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "DNMT3A", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "G543C", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "G543C"}}, "Interpretation": "The DNMT3A gene encodes the protein DNA methyltransferase 3A, an enzyme that is involved in the methylation of newly synthesized DNA, a function critical for gene regulation (Trowbridge and Orkin, 2012; 22200773, Ch\u00e9din, 2011; 21507354). The role of DNMT3A in cancer is uncertain, as some reports describe increased expression and contribution to tumor growth, whereas others propose a role for DNMT3A as a tumor suppressor (Yang et al., 2011; 21887466, Vallb\u00f6hmer et al., 2006; 16870044, Daskalos et al., 2011; 21351083, Fabbri et al., 2007; 17890317, Gao et al., 2011; 22011581, Kim et al., 2013; 23031157). Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. DNMT3A alterations have been reported at relatively low frequencies in solid tumors and are more prevalent in hematological malignancies (cBioPortal, Feb 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of DNMT3A alterations in solid tumors are limited (PubMed, Feb 2021). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in DNMT3A in solid tumors. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI_H is generally infrequent in NSCLC, reported in fewer than 1% of samples across several large studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197, Ninomiya et al., 2006; 16641899, Vanderwalde et al., 2018; 29436178, Zang et al., 2019; 31270941, Dudley et al., 2016; 26880610, Takamochi et al., 2017; 28676214, Schrock et al., 2017; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2016.11.487), whereas data on the reported incidence of MSI_H in SCLC has been limited and conflicting (Pylkkanen et al., 1997; 9329646, Gonzalez et al., 2000; 11061602, Chen et al., 1996; 8782463, Merlo et al., 1994; 8174113). One study reported MSI_H in lung adenocarcinoma patients with smoking history, and 3 of 4 MSI_H patients examined also had metachronous carcinomas in other organs, although this has not been investigated in large scale studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of MSI in NSCLC are limited (PubMed, Oct 2021). On the basis of prospective clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, MSI and associated increased mutational burden (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to anti_PD_1 and anti_PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92)(Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including the approved therapies nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab) (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436), pembrolizumab (Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92). As the MSI status of this tumor is unknown, the relevance of these therapeutic approaches is unclear. While approximately 80% of MSI_H tumors arise due to somatic inactivation of an MMR pathway protein, about 20% arise due to germline mutations in one of the MMR genes (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942), which are associated with a condition known as Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC) (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756). Lynch syndrome leads to an increased risk of colorectal, endometrial, gastric, and other cancers (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756, Pande et al., 2012; 22714864, Kastrinos and Syngal, 2007; 17920897) and has an estimated prevalence in the general population ranging from 1:600 to 1:2000 (Silva et al., 2009; 19466295, Sehgal et al., 2014; 24978665, de la Chapelle et al., 2005; 16136383). Therefore, in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "K139E", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "K139E"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 is one of the most commonly mutated genes in lung cancer; mutations have been reported in 43_80% of non_small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745, Mogi and Kuwano, 2011; 21331359, Tekpli et al., 2013; 23011884, Vignot et al., 2013; 23630207, Maeng et al., 2013; 24222160, Cortot et al., 2014; 24169260, Itakura et al., 2013; 23922113), including 42_52% of lung adenocarcinomas and 58_83% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (cBioPortal, COSMIC, Feb 2021)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, cBio_Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745, Kim et al., 2014; 24323028). TP53 homozygous deletion has been observed in 1.4% of lung adenocarcinoma and <1% of lung squamous cell carcinoma cases (cBioPortal, Feb 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). In one study of 55 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, TP53 alterations correlated with immunogenic features including PD_L1 expression, tumor mutation burden and neoantigen presentation; likely as a consequence of this association TP53 mutations correlated with improved clinical outcomes to PD_1 inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab in this study (Dong et al., 2016; 28039262). Mutations in TP53 have been associated with lymph node metastasis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (Seo et al., 2012; 22975805). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% (17/176) and SDs in 53.4% (94/176) of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21.1% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12.1% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wild_type (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 31.9% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73.4% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 42.9% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76.2% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24.0% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71.4% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75.0% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Additionally, the combination of a CHK1 inhibitor and irinotecan reportedly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival in a TP53_mutated, but not TP53_wild_type, breast cancer xenotransplant mouse model (Ma et al., 2012; 22446188). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may also be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as APR_246 (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571, Lehmann et al., 2012; 22965953, Mohell et al., 2015; 26086967, Franssonet al., 2016; 27179933). In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, APR_246 combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). However, the tumor fraction estimate in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with high tumor fraction values have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus higher sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at a lower risk of false negative results (Li et al., 2021; AACR Abstract 2231). However, if tumor fraction is not detected as high, it does not exclude the presence of disease burden or compromise the confidence of reported alterations. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels. In the research setting, changes in tumor fraction estimates have been associated with treatment duration and clinical response and may be a useful indicator for future cancer management (Bronkhorst
