FBXW7 inactivation is associated with chromosomal instability and with stabilization of proto_oncogenes, such as mTOR, MYC, cyclin E, NOTCH, and JUN; FBXW7 is therefore considered a tumor suppressor (Akhoondi et al., 2007; 17909001, Welcker and Clurman, 2008; 18094723). Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. FBXW7 mutations have been reported in <2% of glioblastoma samples analyzed in the TCGA datasets (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890). Significant decreases in FBXW7 expression have been reported in more than 80% of glioblastoma samples studied (Hagedorn et al., 2007; 17326833). Lower FBXW7 expression has been reported to be associated with reduced survival in patients with glioblastoma, and may correlate with tumor aggressiveness (Hagedorn et al., 2007; 17326833). FBXW7 loss has been reported to be important for glioma progression by allowing its oncogenic targets to accumulate (Hagedorn et al., 2007; 17326833). FBXW7 inactivating alterations may indicate sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors (Mao et al., 2008; 18787170, Yang et al., 2015; 25749036). Several case studies reported clinical benefit for patients with FBXW7_mutated cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma (Villaruz and Socinski, 2014; 24360397), renal cell carcinoma (Olson et al., 2016; 27079472), and cervical squamous cell carcinoma (Kulkarni et al., 2020; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygyno.2020.05.244).

A Phase 2 study of everolimus combined with TMZ and RT for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma reported a median PFS of 6.4 months and median OS of 15.8 months (Ma et al., 2014; 25526733). A Phase 1 trial of everolimus plus TMZ for patients with newly diagnosed or progressive glioblastoma reported partial responses (PR) in 11% (3/28) and stable disease (SD) in 57% (16/28) of cases (Mason et al., 2011; 22160854).

KIT aberrations, including point mutations, translocations, amplification, and overexpression, have been associated with various malignancies, and KIT is considered an oncoprotein (Fletcher, 2004; 15175998). KIT has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210) and may be biologically relevant in this context (Zack et al., 2013; 24071852, Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). In the TCGA datasets, KIT amplification has been reported in 2.5% of lower grade gliomas (grades 2 and 3)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751) and 9.2% of glioblastomas (Grade 4 astrocytoma)(cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). KIT amplification has been variously reported in 4_47% of glioblastomas in the scientific literature (Nobusawa et al., 2011; 21382095, Joensuu et al., 2005; 16021678, Burford et al., 2013; 23990986). Amplification of KIT has been strongly correlated with the presence of KDR and/or PDGFRA amplification in glioblastoma (Joensuu et al., 2005; 16021678, Holtkamp et al., 2007; 17504929, Puputti et al., 2006; 17189383). One study found no correlation between KIT amplification and overall survival in patients with glioblastoma, while a separate study reported that overexpression of KIT was associated with tumor grade and shorter survival in patients with malignant glioma (Nobusawa et al., 2011; 21382095, Skardelly et al., 2009; 19701495). On the basis of clinical evidence, primarily in GIST, AML, and systemic mastocytosis, KIT activating alterations are associated with sensitivity to KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitors including imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib, dasatinib, nilotinib, pazopanib, regorafenib, ponatinib, midostaurin, avapritinib, and ripretinib (Heinrich et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 10506, Heinrich et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 11011, DeAngelo et al., 2017; ASH Abstract 2, Evans et al., 2017; 29093181, Abbaspour Babaei et al., 2016; 27536065, Ramaswamy et al., 2016; 27563456, Demetri et al., 2013; 23177515, Gotlib et al., 2016; 27355533, Jawhar et al., 2017; 28424161, Xu et al., 2014; 25031773, Gotlib et al., 2005; 15972446, George et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 11511).

However, no responses were observed for 10 patients with mastocytosis following everolimus monotherapy, with 8/10 patients harboring the KIT D816V mutation (Parikh et al., 2010; 20038218).

PDGFR aberrations, including point mutations, translocations, amplification, and/or overexpression, have been associated with various malignancies (Fletcher, 2004; 15175998). Amplification of PDGFRA, frequently occurring with amplification of the genes KDR and KIT, has been associated with increased PDGFRA expression (Burford et al., 2013; 23990986, Flavahan et al., 2016; 26700815, Roszik et al., 2016; 26787600, Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251) and poor prognosis (Burford et al., 2013; 23990986, Koschmann et al., 2016; 27582545, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035, Puget et al., 2012; 22389665) in some subtypes of glioma. PDGFRA amplification has been suggested to be more common in higher grade astrocytomas than in lower grade astrocytomas; studies have reported PDGFRA amplification in 16.3% (27/166) of Grade 2 astrocytomas and in 23.6% (91/386) of Grade 3 and 4 astrocytomas analyzed (Holtkamp et al., 2007; 17504929, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035, Motomura et al., 2013; 23242283). PDGFRA amplification has been reported in 5.2_33% of glioblastoma cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Nobusawa et al., 2011; 21382095, Joensuu et al., 2005; 16021678, Alentorn et al., 2012; 23074200). A retrospective analysis of TCGA glioma samples reported elevated expression of ERBB3 correlated with PDGFRA expression and co_expression of these genes was an indicator of poor prognosis in a GBM patient cohort (Song et al., 2018; 29888103). Amplification of PDGFRA has been associated with tumor grade and poor progression_free and overall survival in patients with glioblastoma (Alentorn et al., 2012; 23074200, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035). In addition, PDGFRA amplification has been reported to occur in conjunction with IDH1 mutation in glioblastoma, and both alterations in the same tumor have been associated with poor patient prognosis (Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035). Amplification of PDGFRA has also been strongly correlated with the presence of KDR and/or KIT amplification in glioblastomas, as well as with EGFR amplification (Joensuu et al., 2005; 16021678, Holtkamp et al., 2007; 17504929, Puputti et al., 2006; 17189383, Szerlip et al., 2012; 22323597).

Complete responses to nilotinib have been reported in patients with CEL or hypereosinophilic syndrome with FIP1L1_PDGFRA or activating mutations (Hochhaus et al., 2013; 24057647, Ikezoe et al., 2010; 20303172, Tabouret et al., 2011; 20832858); preclinical evidence has reported efficacy of nilotinib in the context of PDGFRA mutations associated with GIST (Dewaele et al., 2008; 18794084, Weisberg et al., 2006; 17087936). Patients with GIST harboring PDGFRA activating mutations have been reported to derive clinical benefit from treatment with sunitinib (Heinrich et al., 2006; ASCO Abstract 9502, Brohl et al., 2015; 26396737) or regorafenib (Grellety et al., 2015; 28031906, Kollar et al., 2014; 25905001).

Both p15INK4b and p16INK4a bind to and inhibit CDK4 and CDK6, thereby maintaining the growth_suppressive activity of the Rb tumor suppressor; loss or inactivation of either p15INK4b or p16INK4a contributes to dysregulation of the CDK4/6_cyclin_Rb pathway and loss of cell cycle control (Gazzeri et al., 1998; 9484839, Roussel, 1999; 10498883). The tumor suppressive functions of p14ARF involve stabilization and activation of p53, via a mechanism of MDM2 inhibition (Sherr et al., 2005; 16869746, Ozenne et al., 2010; 20549699). One or more alterations observed here are predicted to result in p16INK4a loss of function (Ruas et al., 1999; 10498896, Jones et al., 2007; 17909018, Haferkamp et al., 2008; 18843795, Huot et al., 2002; 12417717, Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Gombart et al., 1997; 9324288, Yang et al., 1995; 7780957, Parry and Peters, 1996; 8668202, Greenblatt et al., 2003; 12606942, Yarbrough et al., 1999; 10491434, Poi et al., 2001; 11255261, Byeon et al., 1998; 9660926, Kannengiesser et al., 2009; 19260062, Lal et al., 2000; 10719365, Koh et al., 1995; 7777061, McKenzie et al., 2010; 20340136, Miller et al., 2011; 21462282, Arap et al., 1997; 905385, Scaini et al., 2014; 24659262, Jenkins et al., 2013; 23190892, Walker et al., 1999; 10389768, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). One or more alterations seen here are predicted to result in p14ARF loss of function (Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Itahana and Zhang, 2008; 18538737, Zhang and Xiong, 1999; 10360174, Zhang et al., 1998; 9529249, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). CDKN2B alterations such as seen here are predicted to inactivate p15INK4b (Jafri et al., 2015; 25873077). Concurrent putative homozygous deletion of CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been reported in 35% of patients with gliomas (cBio_Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661) and detected more frequently in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; 58%)(cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142) than in those with lower grade gliomas (13%) (cBioPortal, Sep 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). In other studies, loss of CDKN2A/B by deletion has been reported in up to 78% of astrocytomas (including anaplastic astrocytomas and GBM) (Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Weber et al., 2007; 16909113). A study found homozygous deletion of both p16INK4a and p14ARF in 26% (13/50) of glioblastomas (GBMs); 18% (9/50) of cases showed homozygous deletion of the p14ARF_encoding locus alone (Nakamura et al., 2001; 11303791). One study detected CDKN2A/B loss in 69% (161/232) and mutation in 2.6% (6/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Decreased p14ARF and p16INK4a expression levels were found to be tightly associated in a study of glioma samples (Chakravarti et al., 2001; 11489817). Homozygous deletion of the genomic region including CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been found to be associated with poor prognosis in GBM and likely serves as an early event in GBM progression (Feng et al., 2012; 21713760, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337). In addition, expression of p16INK4a has been found to be lower in patients with high grade malignant gliomas compared to patients with low grade gliomas, and loss of p16INK4a expression has been associated with shorter overall survival in pilocytic astrocytomas (Raabe et al., 2011; 21636552, Liu et al., 2011; 21843312). Preclinical data suggest that tumors with loss of p16INK4a function may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, ribociclib, and palbociclib (Konecny et al., 2011; 21278246, Katsumi et al., 2011; 21871868, Cen et al., 2012; 22711607, Logan et al., 2013; 23898052). Although case studies have reported that patients with breast cancer or uterine leiomyosarcoma harboring CDKN2A loss responded to palbociclib treatment (Elvin et al., 2017; 28283584, Gao et al., 2015; 26715889), multiple other clinical studies have shown no significant correlation between p16INK4a loss or inactivation and therapeutic benefit of these agents (Gopalan et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8077, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Konecny et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5557)(DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Johnson et al., 2014; 24797823); it is not known whether CDK4/6 inhibitors would be beneficial in this case. Although preclinical studies have suggested that loss of p14ARF function may be associated with reduced sensitivity to MDM2 inhibitors (Van Maerken et al., 2011; 21460101, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357), the clinical relevance of p14ARF as a predictive biomarker is not clear. There are no drugs that directly target the mutation or loss of CDKN2B in cancer. Because the p15INK4b protein encoded by CDKN2B is known to inhibit CDK4, tumors with CDKN2B mutation or loss may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as ribociclib, abemaciclib, and palbociclib (Infante et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 2528, Shapiro et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 2500)(Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126). Germline CDKN2A mutation is associated with melanoma_pancreatic cancer syndrome, a condition marked by increased risk of developing malignant melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer (Whelan et al., 1995; 7666917). Mutation carriers within families may develop either or both types of cancer, and melanoma cases may be referred to as familial or hereditary melanoma (Hansson, 2010; 20687502, Hogg et al., 1998; 9479083). CDKN2A is the most implicated gene in familial melanoma, with germline mutations present in 16% to 20% of familial melanoma cases (De Unamuno et al., 2018; 29543703, Soura et al., 2016; 26892650, Huerta et al., 2018; 29405243). CDKN2A alteration has also been implicated in familial melanoma_astrocytoma syndrome, an extremely rare tumor association characterized by dual predisposition to melanoma and nervous system tumors (Kaufman et al., 1993; 8414022, Bahuau et al., 1998; 9622062, Chan et al., 2017; 28699883).

One or more alterations seen here are predicted to result in p14ARF loss of function (Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Itahana and Zhang, 2008; 18538737, Zhang and Xiong, 1999; 10360174, Zhang et al., 1998; 9529249, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). CDKN2B alterations such as seen here are predicted to inactivate p15INK4b (Jafri et al., 2015; 25873077). Concurrent putative homozygous deletion of CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been reported in 35% of patients with gliomas (cBio_Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661) and detected more frequently in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; 58%)(cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142) than in those with lower grade gliomas (13%) (cBioPortal, Sep 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). In other studies, loss of CDKN2A/B by deletion has been reported in up to 78% of astrocytomas (including anaplastic astrocytomas and GBM) (Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Weber et al., 2007; 16909113). A study found homozygous deletion of both p16INK4a and p14ARF in 26% (13/50) of glioblastomas (GBMs); 18% (9/50) of cases showed homozygous deletion of the p14ARF_encoding locus alone (Nakamura et al., 2001; 11303791). One study detected CDKN2A/B loss in 69% (161/232) and mutation in 2.6% (6/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Decreased p14ARF and p16INK4a expression levels were found to be tightly associated in a study of glioma samples (Chakravarti et al., 2001; 11489817). Homozygous deletion of the genomic region including CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been found to be associated with poor prognosis in GBM and likely serves as an early event in GBM progression (Feng et al., 2012; 21713760, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337). In addition, expression of p16INK4a has been found to be lower in patients with high grade malignant gliomas compared to patients with low grade gliomas, and loss of p16INK4a expression has been associated with shorter overall survival in pilocytic astrocytomas (Raabe et al., 2011; 21636552, Liu et al., 2011; 21843312). Preclinical data suggest that tumors with loss of p16INK4a function may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, ribociclib, and palbociclib (Konecny et al., 2011; 21278246, Katsumi et al., 2011; 21871868, Cen et al., 2012; 22711607, Logan et al., 2013; 23898052). Although case studies have reported that patients with breast cancer or uterine leiomyosarcoma harboring CDKN2A loss responded to palbociclib treatment (Elvin et al., 2017; 28283584, Gao et al., 2015; 26715889), multiple other clinical studies have shown no significant correlation between p16INK4a loss or inactivation and therapeutic benefit of these agents (Gopalan et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8077, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Konecny et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5557)(DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Johnson et al., 2014; 24797823); it is not known whether CDK4/6 inhibitors would be beneficial in this case. Although preclinical studies have suggested that loss of p14ARF function may be associated with reduced sensitivity to MDM2 inhibitors (Van Maerken et al., 2011; 21460101, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357), the clinical relevance of p14ARF as a predictive biomarker is not clear. There are no drugs that directly target the mutation or loss of CDKN2B in cancer. Because the p15INK4b protein encoded by CDKN2B is known to inhibit CDK4, tumors with CDKN2B mutation or loss may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as ribociclib, abemaciclib, and palbociclib (Infante et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 2528, Shapiro et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 2500)(Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126). Germline CDKN2A mutation is associated with melanoma_pancreatic cancer syndrome, a condition marked by increased risk of developing malignant melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer (Whelan et al., 1995; 7666917). Mutation carriers within families may develop either or both types of cancer, and melanoma cases may be referred to as familial or hereditary melanoma (Hansson, 2010; 20687502, Hogg et al., 1998; 9479083). CDKN2A is the most implicated gene in familial melanoma, with germline mutations present in 16% to 20% of familial melanoma cases (De Unamuno et al., 2018; 29543703, Soura et al., 2016; 26892650, Huerta et al., 2018; 29405243). CDKN2A alteration has also been implicated in familial melanoma_astrocytoma syndrome, an extremely rare tumor association characterized by dual predisposition to melanoma and nervous system tumors (Kaufman et al., 1993; 8414022, Bahuau et al., 1998; 9622062, Chan et al., 2017; 28699883). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of CDKN2A is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "CRKL", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "CRKL encodes an adaptor protein that has been shown to mediate growth, motility, and adhesion in solid tumor cells (Yanagi et al., 2012; 22244889). Studies in non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer cells have linked CRKL amplification and overexpression with increased cell proliferation and with tumorigenesis (Wang et al., 2012; 22753141, Cheung et al., 2011; 22586683, Kim et al., 2010; 19966867; Fu et al., 2015; 25318601). CRKL amplification has been identified in various solid tumor types, including uterine carcinosarcoma (7%), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (5.5%)(cBio_Witkiewicz et al., 2015; 25855536), lung squamous cell carcinoma (4.5%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745), sarcoma (4%), ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (3.8%), bladder urothelial carcinoma (3%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 24476821), and melanoma (3%)(cBioPortal, 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Increased CRKL expression has been reported in many tumor types, including lung (Kim et al., 2010; 19966867, Wang et al., 2012; 22753141), breast (Zhao et al., 2013; 23686806, Singer et al., 2006; 16391854), ovarian (Wang et al., 2011; 21319228, Singer et al., 2006; 16391854), pancreatic (Fu et al., 2015; 25318601), skin (Singer et al., 2006; 16391854), colon (Singer et al., 2006; 16391854, Lan et al., 2014; 24389200), hepatocellular (Liu et al., 2013; 23397142), and gastric cancers (Natsume et al., 2012; 22591714). CRKL overexpression has been shown to significantly correlate with reduced OS for patients with NSCLC or hepatocellular carcinoma (Wang et al., 2012; 22753141, Liu et al., 2013; 23397142) and with tumor size and metastasis for patients with breast cancer (Zhao et al., 2013; 23686806). There are no approved therapies that directly target CRKL (Natsume et al., 2012; 22591714, Cheung et al., 2011; 22586683). Preclinical studies report that some cancer cell lines with CRKL amplification are sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) dasatinib (Natsume et al., 2012; 22591714, Lin et al., 2012; 22787428, Cheung et al., 2011; 22586683). However, a patient with CRKL_amplified pancreatic cancer did not respond to dasatinib (Garrido_Laguna et al., 2015; 25897431).

Decreased expression of MTAP leads to MTA accumulation within tumor cells and their microenvironment (Kirovski et al., 2011; 21356366, Limm et al., 2013; 23265702, Stevens et al., 2009; 19097084), thereby reducing intracellular arginine methylation (Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473, Mavrakis et al., 2016; 26912361, Kryukov et al., 2016; 26912360) and altering cell signaling (Limm et al., 2014; 25087184, Stevens et al., 2009; 19097084). MTAP is located at 9p21, adjacent to CDKN2A and CDKN2B, with which it is frequently co_deleted in various cancers. Other alterations in MTAP are rare and have not been extensively characterized. MTAP loss/homozygous deletion as well as loss of expression has been reported in a wide variety of solid tumors and hematologic cancers (Wei et al., 2016; 27929028, Zhao and Zhao, 2016; 27556634); such events have been correlated with poor prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (Kirovski et al., 2011; 21356366), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (Huang et al., 2009; 19887491), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)(Marce et al., 2006; 16778103), melanoma (Meyer et al., 2010; 20500769, Wild et al., 2006; 16618867), gastric cancer (Kim et al., 2011; 21412930), myxofibrosarcoma (Li et al., 2014; 25426549), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (He et al., 2015; 26656376), ovarian carcinoma (Wei et al., 2016; 27929028) and non_small cell lung cancer (Su et al., 2014; 24969958). MTAP loss was not prognostic in pediatric B_cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (Mirebeau et al., 2006; 16818274) or in astrocytoma (Becker et al., 2015; 26088413). However, MTAP has also been reported to be overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (Snezhkina et al., 2016; 27433286), and MTAP retention is thought to be important for prostate cancer growth due to continuous supply of SAM (Bistulfi et al., 2016; 26910893). Germline SNPs in MTAP have been correlated with the development of cutaneous melanoma (Antonopoulou et al., 2015; 25407435, Mccioni et al., 2013; 23816148), esophageal cancer (Hyland et al., 2016; 26635288, Lin et al., 2017; 27960044), osteosarcoma (Zhi et al., 2016; 27994653), and CRC (Gu et al., 2013; 23361049). Preclinical and limited clinical evidence indicate that MTAP inactivation produces specific metabolic vulnerabilities. MTAP inactivation may confer sensitivity to MAT2A inhibitors (Heist et al., 2019; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract B116, Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473). A Phase 1 trial of MAT2A inhibitor AG_270 reported 1 PR and 2 SDs lasting longer than 6 months for patients with advanced solid tumors displaying MTAP loss (Heist et al., 2019; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract B116). Although preclinical data have suggested that MTAP loss sensitizes cells to PRMT5 inhibition (Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473, Mavrakis et al., 2016; 26912361, Kryukov et al., 2016; 2691236), MTAP loss may not be a biomarker of response to previously developed small_molecule SAM_uncompetitive PRMT5 inhibitors (Guccione and Richard, 2019; 31350521); dual PRMT1 and PRMT5 inhibition may be more effective (Fedoriw et al., 2019; 31257072, Srour et al., 2019; 31287990, Gao et al., 2019; 30916320). In preclinical cancer models, MTAP inactivation showed increased sensitivity to inhibitors of purine synthesis or purine analogs, especially upon addition of exogenous MTA, which is converted to adenine in normal cells, thereby providing competition to purine poisons lacking in MTAP_deficient cells (Hansen et al., 2019; 31040154, Tang et al., 2018; 29844120, Munshi et al., 2014; 24928612, de Oliveira et al., 2016; 26751376, Lubin and Lubin, 2009; 19478948, Tang et al., 2012; 22825330, Collins et al., 2012; 22252602, Bertino et al., 2011; 21301207, Coulthard et al., 2011; 21282358, Miyazaki et al., 2007; 17912432, Efferth et al., 2002; 11987241). A Phase 2 study of L_alanosine, an inhibitor of adenine synthesis, as a monotherapy for 65 patients with MTAP_deficient cancers reported no responses and stable disease in 23.6% (13/55) of patients (Kindler et al., 2009; 18618081).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). Low_level MSI has been reported in 5_9% of glioblastoma (GBM) samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927, Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285, Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). A large_scale study did not find high_level microsatellite instability (MSI_H) in any of 129 GBM samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), although a small_scale study reported MSI_H in 4 of 15 pediatric GBMs and 1 of 12 adult GBMs (Szybka et al., 2003; 12908754). The frequency of MSI has been reported to be increased in relapsed compared to primary GBM (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), in GBMs with a previous lower grade astrocytoma (Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285), and in giant cell GBM compared to classic GBM (Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554).

Glioblastoma (GBM) harbors a median TMB of 2.7 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 4.2% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). For pediatric patients, high TMB has been reported in a subset of high_grade gliomas, frequently in association with mutations in mismatch repair or proofreading genes and in TP53, whereas BRAF alterations or other oncogene fusions were observed more frequently in brain tumors harboring low TMB (Patel et al., 2020; 32386112, Johnson et al., 2017; 28912153). Increased TMB has been reported to correlate with higher tumor grade in glioma (Draaisma et al., 2015; 26699864) and glioblastoma (GBM) tissue samples with biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD) (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570), as well as with shorter OS of patients with diffuse glioma (Wang et al., 2020; 32164609).
