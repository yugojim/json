AKT2 is one of three members of the AKT gene family, and activation of AKT2 has been implicated in multiple malignancies (Liu et al., 1998; 9679957, Vivanco and Sawyers., 2002; 12094235). AKT isoforms appear to have different roles in tumorigenesis; AKT1 appears to contribute to the initiation of tumors, whereas AKT2 promotes invasion and metastasis in breast tumors (Chin and Toker., 2011; 21519185). Although AKT2 amplification has been reported to associate with AKT2 overexpression (Cheng et al., 1992; 1409633, Thompson et al., 1996; 8646743, Altomare and Testa., 2005; 16288292), studies in various cancers suggest that AKT2 phosphorylation may have greater clinical relevance than AKT2 amplification or mRNA overexpression (Cicenas., 2008; 18409144, Scrima et al., 2012; 22363436). The incidence of AKT2 amplification has not been extensively assessed in neuroendocrine carcinoma subtypes (cBioPortal, Dec 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). One study reported amplification of AKT2 in 5/48 (10.4%) of small intestine neuroendocrine tumors (Banck et al., 2013; 23676460). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of AKT2 alterations in neuroendocrine tumors are limited (PubMed, Dec 2021). Amplification or activation of AKT2 may promote AKT_mTOR pathway activation and may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of the AKT and downstream mTOR pathways. Clinical benefit has been achieved in 1 patient with AKT2 amplification treated with an mTOR inhibitor (Basho et al., 2017; 27893038). In preclinical studies, the AKT inhibitor MK_2206 showed evidence of enhancing anti_tumor activity of other chemotherapeutic agents in lung and ovarian tumor cells (Hirai et al., 2010; 20571069).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "AKT2 amplification or mutation may lead to AKT_mTOR pathway activation and may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04803318", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03772561", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03297606", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03673787", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03217669", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03065062", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT01582191", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02159989", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02321501", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03017833", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Blood Tumor Mutational Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "21", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "21"}}, "Interpretation": "Blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations from circulating tumor DNA in blood. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a bTMB level that may be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Average bTMB levels in solid tumors other than NSCLC have not been evaluated (cBioPortal, COSMIC, PubMed, Mar 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). In 1 retrospective study of patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors not treated with immunotherapy, tumor mutational burden (TMB)_high (\u226510 Muts/Mb) was not correlated with any significant difference in OS compared with TMB_low (\u2264 10 Muts/Mb) measured in tissue samples (10.4 vs. 6.4 months, adjusted HR = 0.83) (Shao et al., 2020; 33119110). The impact of TMB on the prognosis and clinicopathological features of lung neuroendocrine cancers is unclear; large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) cases with small cell lung cancer_like molecular features were reported to have significantly higher proliferative activity, as well as a trend toward better clinical benefit from treatment with chemotherapy, than non_small cell lung cancer_like tumors, but the average TMB was not significantly different between the two subsets of LCNEC (Rekhtman et al., 2016; 26960398). MCPyV_negative Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), associated with higher TMB, has been reported to have a higher number of predicted tumor neoantigens and a significantly higher UV mutation signature than MCPyV_positive MCC (Harms et al., 2015; 26238782, Goh et al., 2016; 26655088). Within MCPyV_negative MCC tumors, the mutational burden has been reported to be significantly higher in PD_L1_positive tumors (more than 1% positive tumor and macrophage cells by immunohistochemistry) than in PD_L1_negative tumors (Wong et al., 2015; 26627015). On the basis of clinical evidence in NSCLC and HSNCC, increased bTMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511) and anti_PD_1 (Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074) therapies. In NSCLC, multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 to 16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). In HNSCC, a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Increased tumor mutational burden may predict response to anti_PD_1 (alone or in combination with anti_CTLA_4) or anti_PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04237649", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04181788", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02829723", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04521621", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03530397", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03192345", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04261439", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03565445", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03799003", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03179436", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "CCNE1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "true", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "CCNE1 encodes the protein cyclin E1, which plays a role in the regulated transition from the G1 to S phase by binding to and activating cyclin_dependent protein kinase 2 (CDK2). It also has a direct role in initiation of replication and the maintenance of genomic stability (M\u00f6r\u00f6y and Geisen, 2004; 15147722). Amplification of chromosomal region 19q12_q13 has been demonstrated in many types of cancer, and CCNE1 is a well_studied gene within this amplicon (Leung et al., 2006; 16575401, Lin et al., 2000; 11156406). Increased copy number of CCNE1 is highly associated with overexpression of the cyclin E1 protein (Mayr et al., 2006; 16753589, Nakayama et al., 2010; 20336784). Cyclin E1 overexpression can lead to cell transformation as a result of an increase in cyclin E1 activity (Stamatakos et al., 2010; 21176227, M\u00f6r\u00f6y and Geisen, 2004; 15147722). CCNE1 alterations were reported in 9% (28/320) of neuroendocrine tumors in one genomic study (Zakka et al., 2020; 32477464). In one study of lung neuroendocrine tumors, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, cyclin E was overexpressed in 21% (4/19) large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma samples and 71% (25/35) of SCLC samples; overexpression of cyclin E was associated with advanced tumor stage and nodal metastasis (Salon et al., 2008; 19010853). In a study of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, high cyclin E expression was not a significant independent prognostic marker, however, patients with low p27 combined with high cyclin E expression had significantly worse overall survival than patients with high p27 combined with low cyclin E expression (Grabowski et al., 2008; 19010853). Another study examining neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung reported that cyclin E1 expression was associated with Skp2 expression, observed in 86% of high grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (Salon et al., 2007; 17471231). High cyclin E expression alone, or in combination with decreased p27 expression, has been associated with shorter survival of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor patients (Liu et al., 2013; 23534765, Grabowski et al., 2008; 19010853). There are no approved therapies that directly target CCNE1 alterations. Because amplification or overexpression of CCNE1 leads to increased genomic instability though the ATR_CHK1_WEE1 pathway (Lin et al., 2017; 28331049, Chen et al., 2018; 30181387) and cyclin E1 promotes cell cycle progression in a complex with CDK2 (M\u00f6r\u00f6y and Geisen, 2004; 15147722), clinical and preclinical studies have investigated inhibitors of CHK1, ATR, CDK2, and WEE1 as potential therapeutic approaches for tumors with CCNE1 activation. Clinical benefit has been reported for patients with recurrent high_grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) with CCNE1 amplification or expression in response to treatment with the CHK1 inhibitor prexasertib (Lee et al., 2018; 29361470). Studies of the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib observed PRs in patients with CCNE1_amplified HGSOC and ovarian cancer (Lheureux et al., 2021; 33485453, Oza et al., 2020; 32611648). Similarly, in a Phase 2 study of patients with CCNE1_amplified solid tumors, adavosertib elicited an ORR of 26% with PRs reported for patients with ovarian cancer, urothelial carcinoma, or melanoma (Fu et al., 2021; AACR abstract 974). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that cell lines with CCNE1 amplification or overexpression were sensitive to inhibitors of ATR (Toledo et al., 2011; 21552262, Buisson et al., 2015; 26365377), CDK2 (Yang et al., 2015; 26204491), or WEE1 (Kok et al., 2020; 33028815, Chen et al., 2018; 30181387). However, other studies have shown that sensitivity of various cell lines to CDK2 inhibitors, including SNS_032, dinaciclib, and seliciclib, at clinically achievable doses, is largely independent of CCNE1 copy number or expression (Taylor_Harding et al., 2015; 25557169, Etemadmoghadam et al., 2013; 24004674, Scaltriti et al., 2011; 21321214, Nanos_Webb et al., 2012; 21695458). One study has reported a reduction in tumor CCNE1 levels in 4/6 lung and esophageal cancer cases following treatment with the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat (Ma et al., 2013; 23686769).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Strong preclinical and clinical data suggest that CCNE1 amplification may predict sensitivity to WEE1 inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": {"nctId": "NCT03968653", "Include": "true"}}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "FBXW7", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "K374*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "K374*"}}, "Interpretation": "FBXW7 encodes the F_box protein subunit of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets proteins for degradation (Welcker and Clurman, 2008; 18094723). FBXW7 inactivation is associated with chromosomal instability and with stabilization of proto_oncogenes, such as mTOR, MYC, cyclin E, NOTCH, and JUN; FBXW7 is therefore considered a tumor suppressor (Akhoondi et al., 2007; 17909001, Welcker and Clurman, 2008; 18094723). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt FBXW7 function or expression (Welcker et al., 2013; 24298052, Welcker et al., 2007; 17298674, Strohmaier et al., 2001; 11565034, Pashkova et al., 2010; 21070969, Akhoondi et al., 2007; 17909001, O Neil et al., 2007; 17646409, Malyukova et al., 2013; 23228967, Thompson et al., 2007; 17646408). Across publicly available datasets, FBXW7 mutation has been reported in 0% of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), 2.3% (1/44) of prostate neuroendocrine carcinomas, and 3.2% of small cell lung cancer samples (cBioPortal, Oct 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). A sequencing study of gastrointestinal NETs reported FBXW7 mutations exclusively in rectal NETs (5/69, 7.2%)(Park et al., 2019; 30851333). Another study of small intestinal NETs reported both FBXW7 mutation (1/52, 1.9%) and FBXW7 loss of heterozygosity (1/52, 1.9%)(Simbolo et al., 2018; 30219970).

Published data investigating the prognostic implications of FBXW7 alteration in neuroendocrine carcinoma are limited (PubMed, Oct 2021). Reduced FBXW7 expression has been associated with poor prognosis in some cancers such as colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, esophageal SCC, cervical SCC, melanoma, and non_small cell lung carcinoma (Tu et al., 2012; 22548670, Iwatsuki et al., 2010; 19739118, Yokobori et al., 2012; 22576686, Yokobori et al., 2009; 19366810, Yokobori et al., 2014; 24165483, Rajagopalan et al., 2004; 14999283, Cheng et al., 2013; 23381582, Xu et al., 2016; 26954701). FBXW7 inactivating alterations may indicate sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors (Mao et al., 2008; 18787170, Yang et al., 2015; 25749036).

In the RADIANT_2 Phase 3 study, for patients with a NET from various primary sites and with a history of carcinoid syndrome, addition of everolimus to the somatostatin analogue octreotide LAR resulted in a nonsignificant increase in PFS compared to the addition of placebo (16.4 vs. 11.3 months) and did not significantly change OS (29.2 vs. 35.2 months)(Pavel et al., 2017; Pavel et al., 2017; 28444114, Pavel et al., 2011; 22119496); however, a subgroup analysis of patients with lung NET revealed increased median PFS (13.6 vs. 5.6 months)(Fazio et al., 2013; 23187897). A Phase 2 study of pancreatic NETs after failure on systematic chemotherapy reported 9.6% PR and 67.8% SD in response to everolimus and 4.4% PR and 80% SD in response to everolimus plus octreotide LAR (Yao et al., 2010; 19933912). Whereas frequent adverse events precluded a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for the combination of trametinib and everolimus in a Phase 1b trial for solid tumors (Tolcher et al., 2014; 25344362), a retrospective study for heavily pretreated patients with solid tumors reported tolerable regimens of the combination for 23/31 patients, with 16 patients treated >3 months and evaluable patients achieving a median PFS of 6.5 months (Patterson et al., 2018; AACR Abstract 3891). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04803318", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03297606", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03217669", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03065062", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT01582191", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02159989", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02321501", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03017833", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03430882", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "MET", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "true", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "MET encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, also known as c_MET or hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR), that is activated by the ligand HGF; MET activation results in signaling mediated partly by the RAS_RAF_MAPK and PI3K pathways to promote proliferation (Appleman, 2011; 22042966, Jung et al., 2012; 22553051). MET has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210), with amplification positively correlating with protein expression in some cancer types (Ang et al., 2013; 23898085, Abou_Bakr and Elbasmi, 2013; 23996864, Ho et al., 2013; 24258573, Dziadziuszko et al., 2012; 22237262, Madoz_G\u00farpide et al., 2015; 26319934) and associating with therapeutic response to MET inhibitors in a variety of cancer types (Kwak et al., 2015; ASCO GI Abstract 01, Ou et al., 2011; 21623265, Schwab et al., 2014; 24192513, Lennerz et al., 2011; 22042947, Chi et al., 2012; 22162573, Palma et al., 2014; 25232318, Le et al., 2015; 25922291, Ali et al., 2015; 25882375, Kwak et al., 2015; 26432108). MET alterations have not been reported in any of 15 ovarian or 21 prostate small cell carcinomas analyzed in the COSMIC dataset (Mar 2021)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). MET alterations have not been reported in any of the 8 cervical small cell carcinomas analyzed in the COSMIC dataset (Mar 2021)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). MET expression has been reported frequently (in >25% of cases) in pulmonary neuroendocrine cancers, including large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, SCLCs, and both typical and atypical carcinoids (Song et al., 2010; 21043826, Rossi et al., 2005; 16314638, Miao et al., 2017; 28903317). The frequency of MET amplification in neuroendocrine carcinoma has not been evaluated (cBioPortal, PubMed, Jun 2021) (Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). A study of 83 SCLC cases reported a trend toward correlation between MET expression and shorter OS, which reached significance in patients with limited disease_stage tumors (Miao et al., 2017; 28903317). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of MET alterations in neuroendocrine carcinoma are limited (PubMed, Jun 2021). On the basis of extensive clinical evidence, MET amplification or activating mutations may predict sensitivity to MET_targeting therapies such as kinase inhibitors crizotinib, capmatinib, tepotinib, and cabozantinib. Crizotinib has benefited patients with MET_amplified non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of varied histologies (Vassal et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 2595, Li et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 8090, Ou et al., 2011; 21623265, Schwab et al., 2014; 24192513, Le et al., 2015; 25922291, Schrock et al., 2017; 28315738), gastroesophageal cancer (Lennerz et al., 2011; 22042947), glioblastoma (Chi et al., 2012; 22162573), and carcinoma of unknown primary (Palma et al., 2014; 25232318). Capmatinib has demonstrated clinical efficacy for patients with MET_amplified NSCLC both as a monotherapy (Schuler et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9067, Wu et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P1.01_97) and in combination with an EGFR_TKI for patients with concurrent activating EGFR mutations (Wu et al., 2018; 30156984, Gainor et al., 2020; 31864558, Gautschi et al., 2020; 31864554). Tepotinib has demonstrated efficacy for patients with MET_amplified hepatocellular carcinoma (Faivre et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 329) and NSCLC (Le et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9021) as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with gefitinib for patients with MET_amplified and EGFR_mutated NSCLC (Yang et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT193, Park et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 477O, Wu et al., 2019; IASLC Abstract MA09.09). Savolitinib elicited responses in patients with MET_amplified papillary renal cell carcinoma (Gan et al., 2019; 30952639) and gastric cancer either alone or in combination with docetaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834, Kim et al., 2019; 30695737). AMG 337 elicited an ORR of 50% (5/10), including 1 CR, for patients with MET_amplified gastric, esophageal, or gastroesophageal junction cancer (Kwak et al., 2015; ASCO GI Abstract 01). Patients with MET_amplified NSCLC (Spigel et al., 2013; 24101053) or MET_amplified gastric cancer (Catenacci et al., 2011; 22389872) treated with the MET_targeting antibody onartuzumab (MetMAb) achieved clinical responses. In addition, high MET expression has been suggested to predict patient response to therapies such as the monoclonal HGF_targeting antibody rilotumumab, as well as the combination of ramucirumab and the monoclonal MET_targeting antibody emibetuzumab (Oliner et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract 4005, Harding et al., 2019; 31142504). A first_in_human Phase 1 trial of telisotuzumab vedotin (teliso_V), a MET antibody_drug conjugate, reported activity in a subset of patients with MET_positive NSCLC, with an ORR of 19% (3/16) and a DCR of 56% (9/16); no responses were observed in any other patients (Strickler et al., 2019; 30285518). A subsequent Phase 2 trial of teliso_V in patients with MET_positive NSCLC reported a 35% (13/37) ORR in patients with non_squamous, EGFR_wildtype tumors, which met the prespecified criteria for transition to the next stage; lower ORRs were observed in patients with squamous (14%; 3/21) or non_squamous EGFR_mutated (13%; 4/30) tumors (Camidge et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT179).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Activation of MET may lead to increased MET expression and activation and may therefore confer sensitivity to MET inhibitors.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Cabozantinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Cabozantinib inhibits multiple tyrosine kinases, including MET, RET, VEGFRs, and ROS1.

Both p15INK4b and p16INK4a bind to and inhibit CDK4 and CDK6, thereby maintaining the growth_suppressive activity of the Rb tumor suppressor; loss or inactivation of either p15INK4b or p16INK4a contributes to dysregulation of the CDK4/6_cyclin_Rb pathway and loss of cell cycle control (Gazzeri et al., 1998; 9484839, Roussel, 1999; 10498883). The tumor suppressive functions of p14ARF involve stabilization and activation of p53, via a mechanism of MDM2 inhibition (Sherr et al., 2005; 16869746, Ozenne et al., 2010; 20549699). One or more alterations observed here are predicted to result in p16INK4a loss of function (Ruas et al., 1999; 10498896, Jones et al., 2007; 17909018, Haferkamp et al., 2008; 18843795, Huot et al., 2002; 12417717, Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Gombart et al., 1997; 9324288, Yang et al., 1995; 7780957, Parry and Peters, 1996; 8668202, Greenblatt et al., 2003; 12606942, Yarbrough et al., 1999; 10491434, Poi et al., 2001; 11255261, Byeon et al., 1998; 9660926, Kannengiesser et al., 2009; 19260062, Lal et al., 2000; 10719365, Koh et al., 1995; 7777061, McKenzie et al., 2010; 20340136, Miller et al., 2011; 21462282, Arap et al., 1997; 905385, Scaini et al., 2014; 24659262, Jenkins et al., 2013; 23190892, Walker et al., 1999; 10389768, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). Loss of CDKN2A and/or CDKN2B gene expression, either due to deletion or promoter methylation, has been reported in a variety of neuroendocrine (NE) tumors in the scientific literature, including pancreatic endocrine tumors (9%, CDKN2A), NE lung tumors (15%, CDKN2B), and various NE gastroenteropancreatic tumors (up to 44%, CDKN2A and CDKN2B) (Lubomierski et al., 2001; 11479232, Chaussade et al., 2001; 11641784, Moore et al., 2001; 11161385). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the chromosomal region 9p21, which contains CDKN2A and CDKN2B, has been reported to be common in small cell NE carcinomas (SCNCs), with incidences of 50% (8/16), 60% (3/5), and 40% (2/5) in SCNCs of the lung, head and neck, and gastrointestinal tract, respectively; however, a lower incidence of LOH (37%) at this region has also been reported in small cell lung cancer (Dacic et al., 2002; 12378519, Virmani et al., 1998; 9559342). The p15.5 isoform of p15INK4b has been reported to be involved in NE lung tumor carcinogenesis independent of p16INK4a or p14ARF (Chaussade et al., 2001; 11641784). Loss of p14ARF has been reported in a variety of NE tumors, including 40_55% of NE lung tumors, 6% of typical carcinoids, 43% of atypical carcinoids, 50% of large cell NE carcinomas, and 73% of small cell carcinomas (Chaussade et al., 2001; 11641784, Gazzeri et al., 1998; 9731504). Promoter methylation of CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been reported in various NE tumors (Arnold et al., 2008; 18646189, Toyooka et al., 2001; 12467239, Chaussade et al., 2001; 11641784, Muscarella et al., 1998; 9443399, Lubomierski et al., 2001; 11479232). Studies in Merkel cell carcinoma have suggested that methylation of the p14ARF promoter may be a greater contributor to p14ARF protein loss than mutation; one study reported p14ARF methylation in 42% (8/19) of Merkel cell carcinoma cases, but no CDKN2A mutation (Houben et al., 2009; 19400830, Lassacher et al., 2008; 18219279, Simon and Lubomierski, 2004; 15153447). CDKN2A promoter methylation (p16INK4a and p14ARF_encoding loci) in NE tumors has been associated with advanced tumor stage and poor patient outcome (House et al., 2003; 14501508, Simon and Lubomierski, 2004; 15153447, Arnold et al., 2008; 18646189). Preclinical data suggest that tumors with loss of p16INK4a function may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, ribociclib, and palbociclib (Konecny et al., 2011; 21278246, Katsumi et al., 2011; 21871868, Cen et al., 2012; 22711607, Logan et al., 2013; 23898052). Although case studies have reported that patients with breast cancer or uterine leiomyosarcoma harboring CDKN2A loss responded to palbociclib treatment (Elvin et al., 2017; 28283584, Gao et al., 2015; 26715889), multiple other clinical studies have shown no significant correlation between p16INK4a loss or inactivation and therapeutic benefit of these agents (Gopalan et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8077, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Konecny et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5557)(DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Johnson et al., 2014; 24797823); it is not known whether CDK4/6 inhibitors would be beneficial in this case. Germline CDKN2A mutation is associated with melanoma_pancreatic cancer syndrome, a condition marked by increased risk of developing malignant melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer (Whelan et al., 1995; 7666917). Mutation carriers within families may develop either or both types of cancer, and melanoma cases may be referred to as familial or hereditary melanoma (Hansson, 2010; 20687502, Hogg et al., 1998; 9479083). CDKN2A is the most implicated gene in familial melanoma, with germline mutations present in 16% to 20% of familial melanoma cases (De Unamuno et al., 2018; 29543703, Soura et al., 2016; 26892650, Huerta et al., 2018; 29405243). CDKN2A alteration has also been implicated in familial melanoma_astrocytoma syndrome, an extremely rare tumor association characterized by dual predisposition to melanoma and nervous system tumors (Kaufman et al., 1993; 8414022, Bahuau et al., 1998; 9622062, Chan et al., 2017; 28699883). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of CDKN2A is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "ERBB3", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "true", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "ERBB3 (also known as HER3) encodes a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family (Sheng et al., 2011; 21364581). One study has demonstrated a weak but significant association between ERBB3 gene amplification and ERBB3 protein expression in breast cancer tissue (Sassen et al., 2008; 18182100). In neuroendocrine cancers, ERBB3 mutation has been observed in 0_0.9% of small cell lung cancers (cBio_George et al., 2015; 26168399, cBio_Peifer et al., 2012; 22941188 cBio_Rudin et al., 2012; 22941189) and was not seen in pancreatic or prostate neuroendocrine tumors (cBio_Beltran et al., 2016; 26855148, Jiao et al., 2011; 21252315, Cao et al., 2014; 24326773). The frequency of ERBB3 amplification in neuroendocrine cancers has not been assessed (cBioPortal, COSMIC, PubMed, Oct 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of ERBB3 alterations in neuroendocrine cancers are limited (PubMed, May 2021). ERBB3 cooperates with other ERBB family members, in particular ERBB2, for efficient signaling (Black et al., 2019; 31351986, Baselga and Swain, 2009; 19536107, Jaiswal et al., 2013; 23680147, Jura et al., 2009; 20007378). Therefore, ERBB3 amplification or activating mutation may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting ERBB2, including antibodies such as trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and ado_trastuzumab emtansine (T_DM1), and dual EGFR/HER2 TKIs such as lapatinib and afatinib. Clinical and preclinical data support sensitivity of ERBB3 activating mutations to various anti_ERBB2 agents (Choudhury et al., 2016; 27044931, Verlingue et al., 2018; 29413684, Bidard et al., 2015; 25953157, Jaiswal et al., 2013; 23680147, Umelo et al., 2016; 26689995, Mishra et al., 2018; 29963236), but data are generally limited for ERBB3 amplification. Biomarker analyses of several Phase 3 trials have not identified an association of ERBB3 expression levels with benefit from trastuzumab_, pertuzumab_, or T_DM1_containing regimens in HER2_positive breast cancer (Perez et al., 2019; 31146717, Baselga et al., 2014; 25332247, Kim et al., 2016; 27428671, Baselga et al., 2016; 26920887), T_DM1 in HER2_positive gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer (Shah et al., 2019; 30706247), pertuzumab combined with chemotherapy in ovarian cancer (Kurzeder et al., 2016; 27269942), or afatinib in HNSCC (Cohen et al., 2017; 28961833). Similarly, ERBB3 expression levels were not associated with PFS or OS from lapatinib plus capecitabine in a Phase 2 study of gastric/GEJ cancer (LaBonte et al., 2016; 27325685) or in retrospective studies of HER2_positive breast cancer (Nishimura et al., 2017; 28478451, Duchnowska et al., 2017; 29262628, Fabi et al., 2013; 23472669).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "MLL2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "P562fs*6, S3614*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": [{"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "P562fs*6"}, {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "S3614*"}]}, "Interpretation": "MLL2 encodes an H3K4_specific histone methyltransferase that is involved in the transcriptional response to progesterone signaling (Vicent et al., 2011; 21447625). Germline de novo mutations of MLL2 are responsible for the majority of cases of Kabuki syndrome, a complex and phenotypically distinctive developmental disorder (Hannibal et al., 2011; 21671394). A significant number of inactivating MLL2 alterations have been observed in multiple tumor types, suggesting a tumor suppressor role (Fagan et al.,2019; 31128216). MLL2 alterations are observed in a number of solid tumor contexts (COSMIC, Jan 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878), and are especially prevalent in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2012; 22960745) and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) (Augert et al., 2017; 28007623). MLL2 mutation was found to be an independent prognostic factor of poor PFS and OS in non_small cell lung cancer, but not in SCLC (Ardeshir_Larijani et al., 2018; 29627316). One study reported that MLL2 truncating mutations were more common in recurrent ovary granulosa cell tumors (GCT) compared with primary GCTs (24% [10/42] vs. 3.0% [1/32])(Hillman et al., 2018; 29950560). In a study of esophageal SCC, high MLL2 expression positively correlated with tumor stage, differentiation, and size, and negatively correlated with OS (Abudureheman et al., 2018; 29532228). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in MLL2. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors may detect nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI_high (MSI_H) has been observed at high frequency in endometrial cancers (14_33%)(Santin et al., ASCO 2016; Abstract 414, Zighelboim et al., 2007; 17513808, Hampel et al., 2006; 16885385, Stelloo et al., 2016; 27006490, Kanopiene et al., 2014; 25458958, Black et al., 2006; 16549821, Nout et al., 2012; 22609107, Steinbakk et al., 2011; 21547578, Bilbao et al., 2010; 20005452), colorectal cancers (CRCs; 10_15%)(Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), and gastric cancers (12_35%)(Hiyama et al., 2004; 15209621, Wu et al., 1998; 9537253, dos Santos et al., 1996; 8536886, Fang et al., 2013; 23555086) and at lower frequencies in many other tumor types, including esophageal (Hall et al., 2016; ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancer Symposium Abstract 528, Farris et al., 2011; 21422910), small bowel (Gingras et al., 2015; AACR Pancreatic Cancer Abstract PR06, Agaramet al., 2010; 20395525, Ruemmele et al., 2009; 19252434, Planck et al., 2003; 12627520, Hibi et al., 1995; 7775257, Muneyuki et al., 2000; 11117578), hepatobiliary (Zhang et al., 2005; 15918185, Chiappini et al., 2004; 14656944, Suto et al., 2001; 11223838, Momoi et al., 2001; 11580146, Liengswangwong et al., 2003; 14506736, Moy et al., 2015; 25680569, Yoshida et al., 2000; 11063221), prostate (Cheng et al., 2016; Genitourinary Cancers Symposium Abstract 251, Pritchard et al., 2014; 25255306, Azzouzi et al., 2007; 17233803, Burger et al., 2006; 16924473), and urinary tract carcinomas (Harper et al., 2015; USCAP Abstract 905, Bai et al., 2013; 23690119, Giedl et al., 2014; 25319978, Yamamoto et al., 2006; 16675567). In one study, MSI_H status was associated with a positive prognostic effect in patients with gastric cancer treated with surgery alone and a negative predictive effect in patients treated with chemotherapy (Smyth et al., 2015; ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium Abstract 62). Data regarding the role of MSI_H on prognosis and survival in endometrial cancer are conflicting (Zighelboim et al., 2007; 17513808, Kanopiene et al., 2014; 25458958, Bilbao_Sieyro et al., 2014; 25026289, Mackay et al., 2010; 20304627, Steinbakk et al., 2011; 21547578, Arabi et al., 2009; 19275958, Black et al., 2006; 16549821). However, studies specifically analyzing early stage endometrial cancer have reported a correlation between MSI_H and decreased survival (Stelloo et al., 2016; 27006490, Mackay et al., 2010; 20304627, Nout et al., 2012; 22609107, Bilbao et al., 2010; 20005452), thereby suggesting that MSI_H predicts for poor prognosis in this subset of endometrial tumors. On the basis of prospective clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD_1_targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143) and PD_L1_targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92). As the MSI status of this tumor is unknown, the relevance of these therapeutic approaches is unclear.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "E198*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "E198*"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 mutation has been reported in a number of carcinoid_endocrine cases, including 48% (15/31) of the stomach, 9.1% of large intestine, 6.8% of pancreatic, 5.8% of lung, and 4.8% of small intestine origin; TP53 mutations were also observed in 19% of Merkel cell carcinomas, 41% (9/22) of prostate small cell carcinomas, 14% (10/72) of cervical endocrine tumors, and 63% of small cell lung cancer samples (COSMIC, Jan 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878, Fernandez_Cuesta et al., 2014; 24670920, Higaki_Mori et al., 2012; 22795182, Rodig et al., 2012; 23114601, Takahashi et al., 1991; 1656362, Chen et al., 2012; 22389383, Wistuba et al., 1999; 9889022, Tan et al., 2014; 24323898, Yachida et al., 2012; 22251937). The frequency of TP53 mutation or loss and altered p53 levels in neuroendocrine lung tumors has been correlated with the degree of malignancy, as TP53 alterations are more frequent in the most malignant tumor types, including SCLC and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (Kobayashi et al., 2004; 15072592, Przygodzki et al., 1996; 8623922, Onuki et al., 1999; 10091733). Within neuroendocrine tumors, expression of p53 has been associated with aggressive and poorly differentiated gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and with shorter survival in patients with high_grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (O Toole et al., 2010; 20570957, Erler et al., 2011; 21058037, Liu et al., 2013; 23534765, Safatle_Ribeiro et al., 2007; 17206073). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. Mutations in TP53 or RB1 are characteristic of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) (NCCN Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors, v1.2021) (Pavel et al., 2020; 32272208, Baudin et al., 2021; 33482246, Rindi et al., 2018; 30140036, Nagtegaal et al., 2020; 31433515). Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Fraction", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor fraction provides an estimate of the percentage of ctDNA present in a cell_free DNA (cfDNA) sample. The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with elevated tumor fraction have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus high sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at low risk of false negative results. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels. In the research setting, changes in tumor fraction estimates have been associated with treatment duration and clinical response and may be a useful indicator for future cancer management (Bronkhorst
