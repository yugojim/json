Inactivating mutations in BRCA2 can lead to the inability to repair DNA damage and loss of cell cycle checkpoints, which can lead to tumorigenesis (Holloman, 2011; 21731065). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt BRCA2 function or expression (Biswas et al., 2011; 21719596, Biswas et al., 2012; 22678057, Claes et al., 2004; 15026808, Cote et al., 2012; 21947752, Fackenthal et al., 2002; 12145750, Farrugia et al., 2008; 18451181, G\u00f3mez Garc\u00eda et al., 2009; 19200354, Guidugli et al., 2013; 23108138, Kluska et al., 2015; 25948282, Kuznetzov et al., 2008; 18607349, Roy et al., 2012; 22193408, Siaud et al., 2011; 22194698, Thomassen et al., 2006; 16792514, Xia et al., 2006; 16793542, Yang et al., 2002; 12228710, Guidugli et al., 2018; 29394989, Fraile_Bethencourt, et al., 2017; 28339459). In the TCGA dataset, BRCA2 mutation was found in 11% of ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2011; 21720365). A meta_analysis of ovarian carcinoma studies showed germline and somatic BRCA2 alterations to be most prevalent in high_grade serous carcinomas but present at lower frequencies in tumors with endometrioid, clear cell, mucinous, carcinosarcoma, and low_grade serous histologies (Witjes et al., 2021; 34702566). A retrospective meta_analysis of 10,000 patients with ovarian serous carcinoma associated BRCA2 mutation with improved OS (HR=0.58) and PFS (HR=0.61)(Zhong et al., 2015; 25348513). One study reported prolonged 5_year PFS for patients with ovarian cancer and a BRCA2 mutation in the RAD51_binding domain (exon 11) compared to those with either BRCA2 mutations in other domains or with BRCA2 wildtype status (Labidi_Galy et al., 2018; 29084914). Alterations that inactivate BRCA1 or BRCA2 may confer sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Kaufman et al., 2015; 25366685, Mateo et al., 2015; 26510020, Tutt et al., 2010; 20609467, Robson et al., 2017; 28578601, Mirza et al., 2016; 27717299, Sandhu et al., 2013; 23810788, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594, Drew et al., 2016; 27002934, Pujade_Lauraine et al., 2017; 28754483, Ledermann et al., 2016; 27617661, Fong et al., 2009; 19553641, Audeh et al., 2010; 20609468, Fong et al., 2010; 20406929, Gelmon et al., 2011; 21862407, Kaye et al., 2012; 22203755, Domchek et al., 2016; 26723501, Moore et al., 2018; 30345884, Golan et al., 2019; 31157963) or ATR inhibitors (Yap et al., 2020; 32988960, Thomas et al., 2018; 29252124, O Carrigan et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2504, Yap et al., 2016; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract 1LBA, Saito et al., 2018; 31299005). Clinical responses to PARP inhibitors have been reported for patients with either germline or somatic BRCA1/2 mutations (Mateo et al., 2015; 26510020, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594, Ledermann et al., 2016; 27617661, Moore et al., 2018; 30345884, Golan et al., 2019; 31157963) and for patients with platinum_resistant or _refractory disease (Fong et al., 2010; 20406929, Kaufman et al., 2015; 25366685, Sandhu et al., 2013; 23810788, Domchek et al., 2016; 26723501). In a case study, a patient with therapy_induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer and an inactivating BRCA2 rearrangement experienced a CR ongoing for 20 months to the ATR inhibitor berzosertib (Saito et al., 2018; 31299005). Preclinical studies of BRCA1/2 inactivation in T_cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T_ALL) (Pouliot et al., 2019; 31721781), ovarian carcinoma (Kim et al., 2017; 27993965), and triple_negative breast cancer (TNBC) (Jin et al., 2018; 29605721) showing reduced cell viability and increased DNA damage during ATR treatment further support the sensitivity of BRCA2_deficient cells to ATR inhibitors. The placebo_controlled Phase 3 VELIA trial reported a significantly improved median PFS for previously untreated patients with high_grade serous ovarian carcinoma treated with veliparib plus carboplatin_paclitaxel chemotherapy followed by single_agent veliparib maintenance therapy relative to carboplatin_paclitaxel induction without maintenance therapy for BRCA_mutated (34.7 vs. 22.0 months, HR=0.44) and homologous_recombination deficient (HRD; 31.9 vs. 20.5 months, HR=0.57) populations (Coleman et al., 2019; 31562800). In this study, the addition of veliparib to chemotherapy induction without veliparib maintenance did not improve the median PFS (21.1 vs. 22.0 months) relative to chemotherapy induction in the BRCA_mutated (21.1 vs. 22.0 months, HR=1.22) or HRD (18.2 vs. 20.5 months, HR=1.10) cohorts (Coleman et al., 2019; 31562800). WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib has been evaluated as a monotherapy and in combination with PARP_inhibitor, olaparib. In a Phase 2 study for patients with PARP_resistant ovarian cancer, the combination of olaparib and adavosertib elicited improved clinical benefit (ORR 29%, DCR 89%) compared to adavosertib alone (ORR 23%, DCR 63%); however, in the BRCA_mutated cohort, no significant difference in clinical benefit was observed between the combination (ORR 19%) and monotherapy (ORR 20%) treatments (Westin et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 5505). In phase 1 study, 1 of 4 patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutated serous ovarian cancer achieved a PR (Do et al., 2015; 25964244). Inactivation of BRCA2 may also predict sensitivity to DNA_damaging drugs such as trabectedin, lurbinectedin, and the platinum chemotherapies cisplatin and carboplatin (Isakoff et al., 2015; 25847936, Dann et al., 2012; 22406760, Evers et al., 2008; 18559613, Soares et al., 2007; 17656556, Miolo et al., 2016; 27561088, Ghouadni et al., 2017; 28467918, Tedesco et al., 2011; ASCO Abstract 1125, Perez et al., 2017; 28626402, Monk et al., 2020; 31924332, Harnicek et al., 2016; 26933761, Cruz et al., 2018; 30240327, Awada et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 1072, Poveda et al., 2017; 28368437). Alterations in DNA repair genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, CHEK1, CHEK2, FAM175A, MRE11A, NBN, PALB2, RAD51C, and RAD51D have been reported to be predictive for sensitivity to platinum agents and improved overall survival in stage 2\u20134 ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal carcinomas (P = 0.0006)(Pennington et al., 2014; 24240112). One or more of the BRCA2 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (ClinVar, Mar 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Inactivating germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 are associated with autosomal dominant hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (Miki et al., 1994; 7545954, Wooster et al., 1995; 8524414), and the lifetime risk of breast and ovarian cancer in BRCA2 mutation carriers has been estimated to be as high as >80% and 23%, respectively (King et al., 2003; 14576434). Elevated risk for other cancer types, including gastric, pancreatic, prostate, and colorectal, has also been identified, with an increase in risk ranging from 20 to 60% (Friedenson, 2005; 16369438). The estimated prevalence of deleterious germline BRCA1/2 mutations in the general population is between 1:400 and 1:800, with an approximately 10_fold higher prevalence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (Ford et al., 1994; 7907678, Whittemore et al., 1997; 9042908, Claus et al., 1996; 8635102, Struewing et al., 1997; 9145676, Oddoux et al., 1996; 8841192, King et al., 2003; 14576434, Hall et al., 2009; 19241424).

A final analysis observed similar OS rates between groups (34.9 vs. 32.9 months), numerically improved second PFS (23.6 vs. 19.6 months), and clinically meaningful delays in time to first or second subsequent therapy (TFST or TSST) or death for the olaparib group (TFST, 15.4 vs. 10.9 months; TSST, 25.2 vs. 19.9 months) (Penson et al., 2022; SGO Abstract 25). Phase 2 studies reported clinical benefit for patients with BRCA1/2_mutated heavily pretreated platinum_resistant and platinum_sensitive ovarian cancer from the combination of olaparib with cediranib or durvalumab (Lee et al., 2022; 35320892, Drew et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 1190PD). Patients with platinum_sensitive, recurrent BRCA1/2_mutated high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) treated with olaparib monotherapy or olaparib in combination with chemotherapy experienced a statistically superior median PFS compared with controls in the maintenance setting (Ledermann et al., 2014; 24882434, Oza et al., 2014; 25481791); clinical benefit was also reported for patients with platinum_resistant advanced BRCA1/2_mutated HGSOC following olaparib monotherapy treatment (Gelmon et al., 2011; 21862407). A retrospective pooled analysis of Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of olaparib monotherapy for patients with germline BRCA1/2 (gBRCA1/2) mutation_positive advanced relapsed ovarian cancer who progressed on prior lines of chemotherapy reported an ORR of 36% and duration of response of 7.4 months (Matulonis et al., 2016; 26961146). A Phase 1 study of olaparib in combination with liposomal doxorubicin for patients with metastatic ovarian cancer reported an ORR of 61% (11/18) for patients with gBRCA1/2 mutations (Del Conte et al., 2014; 25025963). In a Phase 2 study of olaparib plus pembrolizumab for advanced solid tumors, patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations achieved an ORR of 29% (6/21), whereas patients with mutations in other homologous recombination repair genes achieved an ORR of 6.3% (2/32) (Maio et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT178). Olaparib has been studied primarily to treat patients with ovarian cancer harboring BRCA1/2 mutations. Numerous Phase 2 studies have demonstrated significant clinical activity for patients with BRCA_mutated ovarian cancer, with response rates often significantly higher for patients with BRCA mutations than for those without (Fong et al., 2009; 19553641, Gelmon et al., 2011; 21862407), and for patients with platinum_sensitive (vs. platinum_resistant) cancer (Domchek et al., 2016; 26723501, Matulonis et al., 2016; 26961146, Gelmon et al., 2011; 21862407, Fong et al., 2010; 20406929). As maintenance therapy for patients with newly diagnosed or platinum_sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer, olaparib monotherapy demonstrated significantly improved median PFS (mPFS) and OS compared with placebo in the Phase 3 SOLO_1 study (Moore et al., 2018; 30345884) and multiple later_phase studies (Poveda et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6002, Pujade_Lauraine et al., 2017; 28754483, Ledermann et al., 2016; 27617661, Ledermann et al., 2012; 22452356, Ledermann et al., 2014; 24882434). At the 5_year follow_up of SOLO_1, olaparib continued to improve mPFS compared with placebo for patients with ovarian cancer (Banerjee et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 811MO). In the first study of PARPi rechallenge for patients with ovarian cancer, the Phase 3 OReO/ENGOT Ov_38 study of maintenance olaparib compared with placebo reported statistically improved mPFS for both patients with BRCA_mutated (4.3 vs. 2.8 months, HR=0.57) and BRCA_unmutated (5.3 vs. 2.8 months, HR=0.43) cancer; in an exploratory analysis of the BRCA_unmutated cohort, improved mPFS was reported regardless of homologous recombination deficiency status (Pujade_Lauraine et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA33). Olaparib has also been evaluated in combination with other therapies. A statistically superior median PFS from treatment with olaparib in combination with the VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab compared with bevacizumab monotherapy was reported in the Phase 3 PAOLA_1 study for patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer in the intent_to_treat population (PFS: 22.1 vs. 16.6 months), the BRCA1/2_mutated population (PFS: 37.2 vs. 21.7 months), and the BRCA1/2_wildtype population harboring homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)_positive status (PFS: 28.1 vs. 16.6 months) (Ray_Coquard et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA2). For patients with platinum_sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer who previously progressed on chemotherapy, statistically increased median PFS was reported in a Phase 2 study of olaparib in combination with chemotherapy (PFS: 12.2 months) compared with chemotherapy alone (PFS: 9.6 months) (Oza et al., 2014; 25481791), as well as from treatment with the VEGFR inhibitor cediranib compared with olaparib monotherapy in a Phase 1/2 trial (Liu et al., 2014; 25218906). The Phase 2 CAPRI study for PARP inhibitor_resistant patients with HRD, platinum_sensitive, high_grade ovarian cancer treated with combination therapy of olaparib and the ATR inhibitor ceralasertib reported an ORR of 46% (n=13, 6 PRs) and a PFS of 7.5 months (Wethington et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 5516). For patients with PARP_resistant ovarian cancer, the combination of olaparib and the WEE1_inhibitor adavosertib elicited improved clinical benefit (ORR: 29%; DCR: 89%) compared to adavosertib alone (ORR: 23%; DCR: 63%); however, in the BRCA_mutated cohort, no significant difference in clinical benefit was observed between the combination (ORR: 19%) and monotherapy (ORR: 20%) treatments (Westin et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 5505). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Rucaparib", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> The PARP inhibitor rucaparib is FDA approved to treat patients with metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and deleterious somatic or germline BRCA mutations.

For patients with platinum_sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer (OC), the Phase 3 ENGOT_OV16/NOVA study showed that niraparib maintenance therapy significantly increased median PFS (mPFS) relative to placebo, regardless of germline BRCA (gBRCA) mutation (21.0 vs. 5.5 months, HR=0.27 for patients with gBRCA mutations; 9.3 vs. 3.9 months, HR=0.45 for patients without gBRCA mutations) or homologous recombination deficiency (HDR) status (12.9 vs. 3.8 months, HR=0.38) (Mirza et al., 2016; 27717299, Fabbro et al., 2019; 30638768). Similarly, the Phase 3 PRIMA trial for patients with newly diagnosed advanced OC reported an extended mPFS from niraparib maintenance therapy after response to first_line platinum chemotherapy compared with placebo (13.8 vs. 8.2 months, HR=0.62); subgroup analysis showed that patients with HRD_positive OC experienced the longest mPFS, which was irrespective of BRCA mutational status (21.9 vs. 10.4 months, HR=0.43) (Gonzalez_Martin et al., 2019; 31562799). The Phase 2 QUADRA study evaluating niraparib monotherapy as late_line treatment for patients with relapsed high_grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer (HGSOC) reported a median OS (mOS) of 12.2 months for all HGSOC patients, with highest mOS seen for those with BRCA1/2_mutated and HRD_positive tumors (26.0 and 19.0 months, respectively) (Moore et al., 2019; 30948273).

HRD and consequent genomic LOH occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one or more of the homologous recombination pathway proteins, including BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51C, ATM, PALB2, and BRIP1 (Vanderstichele et al., 2017; 28950147, Watkins et al., 2014; 25093514, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2011; 21720365, Venkitaraman, 2003; 12736286). This sample harbors a genomic LOH score that has been shown to be associated with sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor rucaparib in platinum_sensitive, BRCA1/2 wild_type ovarian, peritoneal, or Fallopian tube carcinoma in both the treatment (Coleman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5540, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594) and maintenance (Coleman et al., 2017; 28916367) settings. In a study of more than 4,000 ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer samples, genomic LOH score \u2265 16% was identified in 24.2% of BRCA1/2 wild_type cases, deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation was identified in an additional 17.2% of cases, and the remaining 58.7% of cases had LOH score < 16% and were BRCA1/2 wild_type (Elvin et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 5512). Among the histological subtypes, LOH score \u2265 16% or BRCA1/2 mutation was reported in 42.4% of serous carcinomas, 37.6% of endometrioid carcinomas, 23.5% of carcinosarcomas, 20.6% of neuroendocrine carcinomas, 13.6% of clear cell carcinomas, and 8.1% of mucinous carcinomas; in BRCA1/2 wild_type samples, the median LOH score was significantly higher in serous as compared with non_serous cases (Elvin et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 5512). In ovarian carcinoma, the median LOH score is significantly higher for BRCA1/2_mutated cases than BRCA1/2 wild_type cases (22.2% vs. 9.8%) (Elvin et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 5512), and mutation or methylation of BRCA1, BRCA2, or RAD51C has been reported to be enriched in cases with increased genomic LOH (Wang et al., 2012; 22912389, Abkevich et al., 2012; 23047548). One study reported no association between LOH and either tumor stage or grade in ovarian serous carcinoma (Marquard et al., 2015; 26015868). In patients with high_grade serous ovarian carcinoma, the frequency of LOH has been reported to increase significantly with age (Pedersen et al., 2013; 23716468). On the basis of emerging clinical data in ovarian cancer, elevated genomic LOH may be associated with greater sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Coleman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5540, Coleman et al., 2017; 28916367, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). In platinum_sensitive, BRCA1/2 wild_type ovarian, peritoneal, or Fallopian tube carcinoma, rucaparib elicited significantly longer median PFS (7.2 vs. 5.0 months, HR=0.51) and improved ORR (33.3% vs. 9.6%, p=0.0003) for patients with LOH score \u2265 16% (Coleman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5540, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). In the maintenance setting in platinum_sensitive, BRCA1/2 wild_type patients, rucaparib was superior to placebo in both the LOH score \u2265 16% (median PFS, 9.7 vs. 5.4 months; HR=0.44) and LOH score < 16% (median PFS, 6.7 vs. 5.4 months; HR=0.58) cohorts (Coleman et al., 2017; 28916367). Similar results have been reported for maintenance treatment with niraparib in ovarian cancer (Mirza et al., 2016; 27717299) when using a different measure of HRD that includes genomic LOH (Telli et al., 2016; 26957554, Timms et al., 2014; 25475740). Increased LOH has also been associated with improved sensitivity to platinum_containing chemotherapy regimens in patients with ovarian or breast cancer (Wang et al., 2012; 22912389, Telli et al., 2015; 25847929, Isakoff et al., 2015; 25847936).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "On the basis of emerging clinical data in ovarian cancer, elevated genomic LOH may be associated with greater sensitivity to PARP inhibitors.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Talazoparib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> The PARP inhibitor talazoparib is FDA approved to treat HER2_negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutations.

A final analysis observed similar OS rates between groups (34.9 vs. 32.9 months), numerically improved second PFS (23.6 vs. 19.6 months), and clinically meaningful delays in time to first or second subsequent therapy (TFST or TSST) or death for the olaparib group (TFST, 15.4 vs. 10.9 months; TSST, 25.2 vs. 19.9 months) (Penson et al., 2022; SGO Abstract 25). Phase 2 studies reported clinical benefit for patients with BRCA1/2_mutated heavily pretreated platinum_resistant and platinum_sensitive ovarian cancer from the combination of olaparib with cediranib or durvalumab (Lee et al., 2022; 35320892, Drew et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 1190PD). Patients with platinum_sensitive, recurrent BRCA1/2_mutated high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) treated with olaparib monotherapy or olaparib in combination with chemotherapy experienced a statistically superior median PFS compared with controls in the maintenance setting (Ledermann et al., 2014; 24882434, Oza et al., 2014; 25481791); clinical benefit was also reported for patients with platinum_resistant advanced BRCA1/2_mutated HGSOC following olaparib monotherapy treatment (Gelmon et al., 2011; 21862407). A retrospective pooled analysis of Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of olaparib monotherapy for patients with germline BRCA1/2 (gBRCA1/2) mutation_positive advanced relapsed ovarian cancer who progressed on prior lines of chemotherapy reported an ORR of 36% and duration of response of 7.4 months (Matulonis et al., 2016; 26961146). A Phase 1 study of olaparib in combination with liposomal doxorubicin for patients with metastatic ovarian cancer reported an ORR of 61% (11/18) for patients with gBRCA1/2 mutations (Del Conte et al., 2014; 25025963). In a Phase 2 study of olaparib plus pembrolizumab for advanced solid tumors, patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations achieved an ORR of 29% (6/21), whereas patients with mutations in other homologous recombination repair genes achieved an ORR of 6.3% (2/32) (Maio et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT178). Olaparib has been studied primarily to treat patients with ovarian cancer harboring BRCA1/2 mutations. Numerous Phase 2 studies have demonstrated significant clinical activity for patients with BRCA_mutated ovarian cancer, with response rates often significantly higher for patients with BRCA mutations than for those without (Fong et al., 2009; 19553641, Gelmon et al., 2011; 21862407), and for patients with platinum_sensitive (vs. platinum_resistant) cancer (Domchek et al., 2016; 26723501, Matulonis et al., 2016; 26961146, Gelmon et al., 2011; 21862407, Fong et al., 2010; 20406929). As maintenance therapy for patients with newly diagnosed or platinum_sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer, olaparib monotherapy demonstrated significantly improved median PFS (mPFS) and OS compared with placebo in the Phase 3 SOLO_1 study (Moore et al., 2018; 30345884) and multiple later_phase studies (Poveda et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6002, Pujade_Lauraine et al., 2017; 28754483, Ledermann et al., 2016; 27617661, Ledermann et al., 2012; 22452356, Ledermann et al., 2014; 24882434). At the 5_year follow_up of SOLO_1, olaparib continued to improve mPFS compared with placebo for patients with ovarian cancer (Banerjee et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 811MO). In the first study of PARPi rechallenge for patients with ovarian cancer, the Phase 3 OReO/ENGOT Ov_38 study of maintenance olaparib compared with placebo reported statistically improved mPFS for both patients with BRCA_mutated (4.3 vs. 2.8 months, HR=0.57) and BRCA_unmutated (5.3 vs. 2.8 months, HR=0.43) cancer; in an exploratory analysis of the BRCA_unmutated cohort, improved mPFS was reported regardless of homologous recombination deficiency status (Pujade_Lauraine et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA33). Olaparib has also been evaluated in combination with other therapies. A statistically superior median PFS from treatment with olaparib in combination with the VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab compared with bevacizumab monotherapy was reported in the Phase 3 PAOLA_1 study for patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer in the intent_to_treat population (PFS: 22.1 vs. 16.6 months), the BRCA1/2_mutated population (PFS: 37.2 vs. 21.7 months), and the BRCA1/2_wildtype population harboring homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)_positive status (PFS: 28.1 vs. 16.6 months) (Ray_Coquard et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA2). For patients with platinum_sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer who previously progressed on chemotherapy, statistically increased median PFS was reported in a Phase 2 study of olaparib in combination with chemotherapy (PFS: 12.2 months) compared with chemotherapy alone (PFS: 9.6 months) (Oza et al., 2014; 25481791), as well as from treatment with the VEGFR inhibitor cediranib compared with olaparib monotherapy in a Phase 1/2 trial (Liu et al., 2014; 25218906). The Phase 2 CAPRI study for PARP inhibitor_resistant patients with HRD, platinum_sensitive, high_grade ovarian cancer treated with combination therapy of olaparib and the ATR inhibitor ceralasertib reported an ORR of 46% (n=13, 6 PRs) and a PFS of 7.5 months (Wethington et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 5516). For patients with PARP_resistant ovarian cancer, the combination of olaparib and the WEE1_inhibitor adavosertib elicited improved clinical benefit (ORR: 29%; DCR: 89%) compared to adavosertib alone (ORR: 23%; DCR: 63%); however, in the BRCA_mutated cohort, no significant difference in clinical benefit was observed between the combination (ORR: 19%) and monotherapy (ORR: 20%) treatments (Westin et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 5505). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Rucaparib", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> The PARP inhibitor rucaparib is FDA approved to treat patients with metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and deleterious somatic or germline BRCA mutations.

In the Phase 3 ARIEL 3 study, rucaparib as maintenance therapy significantly improved mPFS (16.6 vs. 5.4 months, HR=0.23) with CR rates of 18% for patients with germline or somatic BRCA_mutated recurrent ovarian cancer compared with placebo treatment (Coleman et al., 2017; 28916367). In the Phase 2 ARIEL 2 trial, patients with BRCA_mutated platinum_sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer experienced an mPFS of 12.8 months on rucaparib (Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). In the Phase 3 ATHENA study, rucaparib monotherapy significantly improved median PFS (mPFS) as first_line maintenance therapy compared with placebo for patients with ovarian cancer in both the homologous recombination deficient (HRD)_positive population (BRCA_mutated or BRCA_wildtype and high genomic loss of heterozygosity [LOH] score defined as \u226516%; mPFS of 28.7 vs. 11.3 months, HR=0.47) and the overall population (mPFS of 20.2 vs. 9.2 months, HR=0.52); exploratory subgroup analysis also reported benefit for the HRD_negative group (BRCA_wildtype and low genomic LOH score defined as <16%; mPFS of 12.1 vs. 9.1 months, HR=0.65)(Monk et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract LBA5500). In the Phase 3 ARIEL3 study of rucaparib maintenance treatment for patients with platinum_sensitive high_grade serous or endometrioid ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma, mPFS was significantly improved with rucaparib compared with placebo for patients, irrespective of HRD status or BRCA status, with benefit observed for both the LOH_high subgroup (13.6 vs. 5.4 months, HR=0.32) and the overall population (10.8 vs. 5.4 months, HR=0.36), with CR rates of 12% for the HRD_positive group and 7% for the overall population; PFS benefit was also observed for the BRCA_wildtype, LOH_low group (HR=0.58)(Coleman et al., 2017; 28916367).

For patients with platinum_sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer (OC), the Phase 3 ENGOT_OV16/NOVA study showed that niraparib maintenance therapy significantly increased median PFS (mPFS) relative to placebo, regardless of germline BRCA (gBRCA) mutation (21.0 vs. 5.5 months, HR=0.27 for patients with gBRCA mutations; 9.3 vs. 3.9 months, HR=0.45 for patients without gBRCA mutations) or homologous recombination deficiency (HDR) status (12.9 vs. 3.8 months, HR=0.38) (Mirza et al., 2016; 27717299, Fabbro et al., 2019; 30638768). Similarly, the Phase 3 PRIMA trial for patients with newly diagnosed advanced OC reported an extended mPFS from niraparib maintenance therapy after response to first_line platinum chemotherapy compared with placebo (13.8 vs. 8.2 months, HR=0.62); subgroup analysis showed that patients with HRD_positive OC experienced the longest mPFS, which was irrespective of BRCA mutational status (21.9 vs. 10.4 months, HR=0.43) (Gonzalez_Martin et al., 2019; 31562799). The Phase 2 QUADRA study evaluating niraparib monotherapy as late_line treatment for patients with relapsed high_grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer (HGSOC) reported a median OS (mOS) of 12.2 months for all HGSOC patients, with highest mOS seen for those with BRCA1/2_mutated and HRD_positive tumors (26.0 and 19.0 months, respectively) (Moore et al., 2019; 30948273).

It is an oncogene and may be activated in as many as 20% of cancers (Dang et al., 2006; 16904903). MYC dysregulation (amplification, overexpression, translocation) has been identified in a number of different cancer types (Nesbit et al., 1999; 10378696). MYC amplification has been significantly linked with increased mRNA and protein levels and results in the dysregulation of a large number of target genes (Blancato et al., 2004; 15083194, Dang et al., 2006; 16904903, Fromont et al., 2013; 23574779). Amplification of the MYC gene has been identified in 25_60% of ovarian tumors (cBio_Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2011; 21720365, Prathapam et al., 2010; 20647308, Koboldt et al., 2012; 22300766, Sasano et al., 1990; 1969381, Dimova et al., 2006; 16458500). Overexpression of the MYC protein has been observed in 66% (31/47) of ovarian epithelial tumors (Chen et al., 2005; 16174239). For patients with ovarian carcinoma, MYC amplification has been associated with increased malignancy, higher histological grade, and poorer overall survival (Katsaros et al., 1995; 7654038, Dimova et al., 2006; 16458500). Preclinical data indicate MYC overexpression may predict sensitivity to investigational agents targeting CDK1 (Horiuchi et al., 2012; 22430491, Goga et al., 2007; 17589519), CDK2 (Molenaar et al., 2009; 19525400), Aurora kinase A (Dammert et al., 2019; 31375684, Mollaoglu et al., 2017; 28089889, Robert et al., 2017; 29088717, Wang et al., 2017; 28417568, Takahashi et al., 2015; 25632068, Li et al., 2018; 30226440, Kong et al., 2017; DOI: 10.21037/tcr.2017.06.41, Mahadeva et al., 2014; 24893165, Park et al., 2019; 31429028), Aurora kinase B (Helfrich et al., 2016; 27496133, Hook et al., 2012; 22222631, Yang et al., 2010; 20643922, He et al., 2019; 30540594), glutaminase (Shroff et al., 2015; 25964345, Effenberger et al., 2017; 29156762, Shen et al., 2018; 30103944, Xiang et al., 2015; 25915584), or BET bromodomain_containing proteins (Delmore et al., 2011; 21889194, Bandopadhayay et al., 2013; 24297863, Loven et al., 2013; 23582323, Otto et al., 2019; 31734632), as well as agents targeting both HDAC and PI3K (Dong et al., 2013; 23866964, Pei et al., 2016; 26977882; Fu et al., 2019; 30224636). Exploratory biomarker analysis in a Phase 2 study reported a PFS benefit associated with a combination of the Aurora A kinase inhibitor alisertib and paclitaxel as second_line therapy for patients with MYC_overexpressed small cell lung cancer but not for patients without MYC overexpression (Owonikoko et al., 2020; 31655296). A PR was reported for a patient with MYC_amplified invasive ductal breast carcinoma treated with an unspecified Aurora kinase inhibitor and taxol (Ganesan et al., 2014; 25253784). MYC amplification has also been suggested to predict response to chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer in some studies (Pereira et al., 2013; 23555992, Yasojima et al., 2011; 21741827). Preclinical evidence suggests that colon cancer cells with MYC amplification may be more sensitive to 5_fluorouracil and paclitaxel (Arango et al., 2001; 11406570, Bottone et al., 2003; 14516787).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "MYC overexpression may predict sensitivity to inhibition of CDKs, especially CDK1 and CDK2, of Aurora kinases, including Aurora kinase A and B, and of BET domain proteins, which are reported to downregulate MYC expression and MYC_dependent transcriptional programs.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04983810", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04742959", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04553133", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT01434316", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04555837", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "NF2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "E90fs*9", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "E90fs*9"}}, "Interpretation": "Merlin, encoded by NF2, coordinates cell contact with growth signals; the inactivation of Merlin disrupts this mechanism and can lead to unrestrained growth despite cell contact (Curto and McClatchey, 2008; 17971776). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt NF2 function or expression (Laulajainen et al., 2012; 22325036, Lallemand et al., 2009; 19910496, Sherman et al., 2007; 9395247, Li et al., 2012; 22482125, Manetti et al., 2012; 23213372, Stokowski et al., 2000; 10712203, Mani et al., 2011; 21402777). In the Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma TCGA datasets, NF2 mutation or homozygous deletion was observed in fewer than 1% of cases (cBio_Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011; 21720365). No significant relationship was identified between Merlin expression levels and grade, stage, or overall survival of patients with serous ovarian cancer, although low Merlin mRNA expression correlated with increased survival in cohorts that were optimally_debulked or treated with platinum plus taxol (Shah et al., 2014; 24786638). NF2 inactivating alterations may indicate sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors (Lopez_Lago et al., 2009; 19451229, James et al., 2009; 19451225, Pachow et al., 2013; 23406776, Iyer et al., 2012; 22923433). Two case studies reported clinical benefit for patients with NF2_mutated cancers, including urothelial carcinoma (Ali et al., 2015; 25630452) and metaplastic breast cancer (Ganesan et al., 2014; 25253784, Moulder et al., 2015; 25878190) treated with everolimus and temsirolimus, respectively. Loss or inactivation of NF2 may also predict sensitivity to FAK inhibitors based on clinical data in mesothelioma (Soria et al., 2016; 27733373) and meningioma (Brastianos et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 2502) and strong preclinical data (Poulikakos et al., 2006; 16652148, Shapiro et al., 2014; 24848258, Shah et al., 2014; 24786638). Limited preclinical and clinical evidence in vestibular schwannoma suggests possible sensitivity of NF2_deficient tumors to the pan_ERBB inhibitor lapatinib (Ammoun et al., 2010; 20511180, Karajannis et al., 2012; 22844108). Similarly, on the basis of limited clinical (Subbiah et al., 2011; ASCO Abstract 2100) and preclinical (Garcia_Rendueles et al., 2015; 26359368, Ammoun et al., 2008; 18593924, Yi et al., 2011; 21481793) evidence, NF2 inactivation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, such as approved agents trametinib and cobimetinib. These and other relevant compounds are being investigated in clinical trials. Whereas frequent adverse events precluded a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for the combination of trametinib and everolimus in a Phase 1b trial for solid tumors (Tolcher et al., 2014; 25344362), a retrospective study for heavily pretreated patients with solid tumors reported tolerable regimens of the combination for 23/31 patients, with 16 patients treated >3 months and evaluable patients achieving a median PFS of 6.5 months (Patterson et al., 2018; AACR Abstract 3891). Heterozygous germline NF2 loss or inactivation is associated with neurofibromatosis type 2, which results in the development of vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas, ependymomas, and ocular disturbances (Evans et al., 2011; 21358190, Lu_Emerson and Plotkin, 2009; 19898272, Asthagiri et al., 2009; 19476995).

Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 alterations have been reported in 29_80% of ovarian tumors, with a higher incidence in high_grade pelvic (primary ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal) serous carcinoma, with incidence of 91_97% (Ahmed et al., 2010; 20229506, Wojnarowicz et al., 2012; 23029043, Kuhn et al., 2012; 21990067, Karst and Drapkin, 2010; 19746182, Gadducci et al., 2012; 22304686, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011; 21720365, Rechsteiner et al., 2013; 23965232, Okamoto et al., 1991; 1680546). One study reports TP53 mutation in all subtypes of ovarian carcinoma, including 57% (8/14) of mucinous, 28% (8/29) of high grade endometrioid, and 52% (13/25) of clear cell cases (Rechsteiner et al., 2013; 23965232). One study reported TP53 mutation in 6.7% of low grade ovarian endometrioid carcinomas (McConechy et al., 2014; 23765252). TP53 mutations have been reported to be more frequent in advanced stage (63%, 55/87) and higher grade (65%, 42/64) than earlier stage (31%, 14/45) and lower grade (41%, 7/17) ovarian carcinomas (Rechsteiner et al., 2013; 23965232). Meta_analysis has suggested that TP53 expression was associated with poorer survival in ovarian epithelial cancers, although the effect was modest and considerable variability was observed between studies (de Graeff et al., 2009; 19513073). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may also be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as APR_246 (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571, Lehmann et al., 2012; 22965953, Mohell et al., 2015; 26086967, Franssonet al., 2016; 27179933). In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, APR_246 combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "TP53 loss of function alterations may predict sensitivity to WEE1 inhibitors.

Defective MMR occurring as a result of mutation(s) in the MMR family (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2) can result in microsatellite instability (MSI), common in colon, endometrium, and stomach cancers (You et al., 2010; 21081928). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt MSH6 function or expression (Li et al., 2013; 23622243, Wu et al., 2011; 21720545, Edelbrock et al., 2013; 23391514, Berends et al., 2002; 11709755, Warren et al., 2007; 17531815, Geng et al., 2012; 22277660). MSH6 mutations have been reported in 2.1% of ovarian carcinoma tumors analyzed in the COSMIC database (Mar 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). In the TCGA ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma dataset MSH6 mutation was found in <1% of patients (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2011; 21720365). The risk of ovarian cancer associated with mutations in MSH6 (approximately 1%) has been reported to be lower than that associated with mutations in MLH1 or MSH2 (12% and 16%, respectively) (Bonadona et al., 2011; 21642682). Numerous studies in various cancer types have shown that MSH6 loss or inactivation is associated with MSI and increased mutation burden (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, You et al., 2010; 21081928, Joly et al., 2015; 25504677, Pritchard et al., 2014; 25255306, Rosty et al., 2014; 25117503, McConechy et al., 2015; 25636458). Clinical studies have shown that MSI is associated with patient responses to anti_programmed death 1 (PD_1) immune checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab (Le et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract LBA100)(Le et al., 2015; 26028255) and nivolumab (Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436). Higher mutation burden was also reported to be associated with response to pembrolizumab (Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070). Furthermore, MSI status correlates with higher PD_1 and PD_L1 expression (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179), potential biomarkers of response to PD_1 targeted immunotherapies. Therefore, inactivation of MSH6 may confer sensitivity to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors. Germline mutations in MSH6 are associated with both \"typical\" and \"atypical\" forms of autosomal dominant Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC), which accounts for 1_7% of all colorectal cancers (Silva et al., 2009; 19466295). Approximately 10% of all Lynch syndrome_associated mutations have been attributed to alterations in MSH6 (Peltomaki, 2005; 16083711). Carriers of mutations in MSH6 have a 60_80% risk of colorectal cancer (Kastrinos and Syngal, 2007; 17920897). Lynch syndrome has an estimated prevalence in the general population ranging from 1:600 to 1:2000 (Silva et al., 2009; 19466295, Sehgal et al., 2014; 24978665, de la Chapelle et al., 2005; 16136383). Biallelic germline mutation of MSH6 has been shown to account for 20% of cases of the very rare syndrome Constitutional Mismatch Repair Deficiency (CMMRD), which is characterized by a 95% incidence rate of childhood onset lymphoma, leukemia and brain tumors, followed by early_onset colorectal cancer (reviewed in Wimmer et al., 2008; 18709565, Wimmer et al., 2014; 24737826, Scott et al., 2007; 17259933, Ripperger et al., 2010; 20015892, Baris et al., 2016; 26544533). Given the association between MSH6 and these inherited syndromes, in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of MSH6 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI_high (MSI_H) has been reported in 1.6_19.7% of ovarian cancer samples (Segev et al., 2015; 26775351, Plisiecka_Ha\u0142asa et al., 2008; 18507046), including 3.8% (1/26) of ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinomas (Huang et al., 2015; 25195947), and 10.0% (3/30) of ovarian clear cell carcinomas (CCOCs) (Strickland et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5514). No association of MSI_H with stage or survival was found in patients with ovarian cancer (Segev et al., 2015; 26775351, Aysal et al., 2012; 22189970). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "03", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "03"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB level associated with lower rates of clinical benefit from treatment with PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors compared with patients with tumors harboring higher TMB levels, based on several studies in multiple solid tumor types (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). Ovarian carcinomas, including peritoneal and Fallopian tube carcinomas, harbor a median TMB of 2.7_3.6 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb) depending upon subtype, and up to 2.1% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). In a study of high grade serous ovarian cancer, homologous recombination (HR)_deficient tumors, which comprised ~50% of all samples, harbored a higher neoantigen load compared to HR_proficient tumors; higher neoantigen load was associated with longer OS but not disease free survival (Strickland et al., 2016; 26871470). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, increased tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Ott et al., 2019; 30557521, Cristescu et al., 2022; 35101941, Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). In the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors, significant improvement in ORR was observed for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) compared with those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526); similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). At the same TMB cutpoint, retrospective analysis of patients with solid tumors treated with any checkpoint inhibitor identified that tissue TMB scores \u2265 10 Muts/Mb were associated with prolonged time to treatment failure compared with scores <10 muts/Mb (HR=0.68) (Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). For patients with solid tumors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the CheckMate 848 trial, improved responses were observed in patients with a tissue TMB \u2265 10 Muts/Mb independent of blood TMB at any cutpoint in matched samples (Schenker at al., 2022; AACR Abstract 7845). However, support for higher TMB thresholds and efficacy was observed in the prospective Phase 2 MyPathway trial of atezolizumab for patients with pan_solid tumors, where improved ORR and DCR was seen in patients with TMB \u2265 16 Muts/Mb than those with TMB \u2265 10 and <16 Muts/Mb (Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409). Similarly, analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017;
