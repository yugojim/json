The BARD1 ANK repeats and BRCT motifs play important roles in chromosome stability, and both these regions and the RING domain are necessary for homology_directed repair (Laufer et al., 2007; 17848578, Wu et al., 2015; 25634209, Westermark et al., 2003; 14560035). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt BARD1 function or expression. BARD1 mutations have been found in 0.9_2.8% of colorectal adenocarcinomas and other colon cancers (cBio_Seshagiri et al., 2012; 22895193, cBio_Brannon et al., 2014; 25164765, cBio_Giannakis et al., 2016; 27149842, cBio_Yaeger et al., 2018; 29316426, Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of BARD1 alterations in colon cancer are limited (PubMed, Mar 2023). In one study, loss of BARD1 expression was correlated with worse prognosis in colon cancer (Sporn et al., 2011; 21693656). Clinical benefit from rucaparib has been observed in a patient with BARD1_mutated ovarian cancer (O Malley et al., 2017; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract LB_A12). On the basis of preclinical evidence, tumors with BARD1 inactivation may be sensitive to PARP inhibitors (Wu et al., 2015; 25634209, Wang et al., 2016; 27454289, Ozden et al., 2016; 27197561, Nguyen et al., 2017; AACR Abstract 2476, Zhao et al., 2017; 28976962).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Tumors with BARD1 inactivating mutation or loss may be sensitive to PARP inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04123366", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03742895", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02264678", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05035745", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03772561", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03127215", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03297606", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04991480", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05327010", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "BRAF", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "V600E", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "25.91", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "V600E"}}, "Interpretation": "BRAF encodes a member of the RAF family of protein kinases, which includes ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF. These kinases function downstream of RAS as part of the MAPK (RAF_MEK_ERK) signaling cascade that facilitates cell proliferation, survival and transformation (Holderfield et al., 2014; 24957944, Burotto et al., 2014; 24948110). BRAF mutations have been reported in up to 20% of all cancers, with the majority of mutations occurring at the V600 position (Davies et al., 2002; 12068308, Kandoth et al., 2013; 24132290). Among the V600 mutations, V600E accounts for 70_80% of observations, V600K for 10_30%, and V600R for 5_7%, with V600D comprising the majority of the rest (Davies et al., 2002; 12068308, Greaves et al., 2013; 23273605, Klein et al., 2013; 23237741). Mutations at V600 are Class 1 BRAF alterations that have been shown to constitutively activate BRAF kinase and hyperactivate the downstream MEK_ERK signaling, promoting oncogenic transformation (Wellbrock et al., 2004; 15059882, Davies et al., 2002; 12068308). In multiple cancer types, multiple mutations at V600, including V600E, V600K, V600R, V600D, and V600M, exhibited sensitivity to V600_targeted therapies (Hauschild et al., 2012; 22735384, McArthur et al., 2014; 24508103, Fisher et al., 2012; 22904646, Yang et al., 2010; 20551065, Gentilcore et al., 2013; 23317446, Klein et al., 2013; 23237741, van den Brom et al., 2013; 23473613, Klein et al., 2013; 23490649, Ponti et al., 2013; 23463675, Ponti et al., 2012; 23031422, Parakh et al., 2015; 25382067, Lee et al., 2017; 28194436); other mutations at this position are predicted to behave similarly. BRAF mutations have been reported in approximately 5_19% of colorectal cancer samples (De Roock et al., 2011; 21163703, Di Nicolantonio et al., 2008; 19001320, Dienstmann et al., 2012; 22723336, Safaee et al., 2012; 23056577, Guedes et al., 2013; 23548132). BRAF V600E is a strong adverse prognostic marker in colorectal cancer (NCCN Colon Cancer Guidelines, v3.2022, NCCN Rectal Cancer Guidelines, v4.2022, Cervantes et al., 2023; 36307056). BRAF mutations have been associated with poor prognosis and shorter survival for patients with colorectal cancer, particularly those with metastatic disease, as well as with smoking history (Sinicrope et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract 3514, Hassabo et al., 2014; ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium Abstract 473) (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Bokemeyer et al., 2012; 22446022, Gavin et al., 2012; 23045248, Laurent_Puig et al., 2009; 19884556, Ogino et al., 2012; 22147942, Roth et al., 2010; 20008640, Douillard et al., 2013; 24024839, Hsu et al., 2016; 26989027). Analysis of individual BRAF mutations in 2127 patients with advanced colorectal cancer treated with chemotherapy with or without cetuximab revealed that BRAF V600E associated with poor prognosis (HR 2.60, P=1.0e_15, with median reduction of survival being 320 days) and distinct clinicopathological features, including correlation with increased peritoneal metastases compared to BRAF wild_type tumors (24% vs. 12%, P=0.0015), while BRAF D594G inactivating mutation was not prognostic (HR 1.30, P=0.37) and had similar clinicopathologic features as BRAF wild_type tumors (Summers et al., 2016; 27815357). Significant benefit for patients with BRAF V600_mutated colorectal cancers (CRC) has been achieved with combinatorial approaches involving BRAF inhibitors, EGFR_targeting antibodies, and MEK inhibitors (Kopetz et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 4001, Corcoran et al., 2018; 29431699, Hyman et al., 2015; 26287849, Yaeger et al., 2015; 25589621, Kopetz et al., 2020; 33356422). In a Phase 3 study for patients with metastatic CRC on second_ or third_line treatments, doublet therapy with the RAF inhibitor encorafenib and the EGFR antibody cetuximab showed superior mOS to cetuximab plus chemotherapy (9.3 vs. 5.9 months, HR=0.61, n=220 and n=221), and similar benefit was seen for a triplet therapy cohort adding the MEK inhibitor binimetinib (OS of 9.3 months, n=224) (Kopetz et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 4001). Combinations of other RAF inhibitors such as dabrafenib or vemurafenib with EGFR antibodies such as panitumumab have also resulted in clinical benefit for similar patient populations in Phase 1 and 2 studies. A trial of dabrafenib and panitumumab with or without the MEK inhibitor trametinib reported a 21% ORR and 86% DCR (n=91) for the triplet combination and a 10% ORR and 90% DCR (n=20) for the doublet therapy (Corcoran et al., 2018; 29431699). Multiple similar studies of vemurafenib with panitumumab or cetuximab doublet therapy have also reported a benefit (Hyman et al., 2015; 26287849, Yaeger et al., 2015; 25589621). In a randomized Phase 2 study for patients with 0_4 previous lines of therapy, the addition of vemurafenib to cetuximab and irinotecan significantly improved ORR (17% vs. 4.2%, n=50 and n=50) and DCR (65% vs. 21%) (Kopetz et al., 2020; 33356422). A Phase 2 trial evaluating the investigational agent spartalizumab, an anti_PD_1 antibody, with dabrafenib and trametinib reported an ORR of 35% (n=20) and DCR of 75% (Corcoran et al., 2020; ESMO GI Abstract SO_26). Extensive clinical evidence supports a significant benefit in BRAF_inhibitor and MEK_inhibitor doublet therapy for patients with BRAF V600E_mutated metastatic CRC. A Phase 2 study of vemurafenib plus cobimetinib for patients with advanced BRAF V600E_mutated CRC reported an ORR of 29% (n=28) and DCR of 57% (Klute et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 122), and a similar trial of dabrafenib and trametinib reported a 12% ORR (n=43) and 67% DCR (Corcoran et al., 2015; 26392102). A basket trial of the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib for patients with BRAF V600_mutated solid cancers elicited 1 PR and 1 SD for 3 patients with CRC (Ascierto et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 9518). In 2 Phase 1 studies evaluating the MEK_pan_RAF dual inhibitor CH5126766, 3 patients harboring BRAF V600E mutations experienced PRs, including 2 patients with melanoma (Martinez_Garcia et al., 2012; 22761467) and 1 patient with low_grade serous ovarian carcinoma (Guo et al., 2020; 33128873). Based on clinical data in solid tumors, patients with tumors harboring BRAF V600 mutations may benefit from treatment with type_II RAF inhibitors such as tovorafenib, lifirafenib, and belvarafenib (Olszanski et al., 2017; DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdx367.043, Desai et al., 2020; 32182156, Janku et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 2586, Yen et al., 2021; 33953400). On the basis of extensive clinical data, BRAF V600 mutation does not generally associate with significant clinical benefit from addition of cetuximab or panitumumab to chemotherapy (NCCN Colon Cancer Guidelines, v3.2022) (Pietrantonio et al., 2015; 25673558, Rowland et al., 2015; 25989278, Van Custem et al., 2011; 21502544, Smith et al., 2013; 23741067, Douillard et al., 2013; 24024839, Karapetis et al., 2014; 24218517, Peeters et al., 2013; 23325582, Peeters et al., 2015; 26341920, Guren et al., 2017; 28399112, Seymour et al., 2013; 23725851). Low response rates to cetuximab or panitumumab monotherapy or combination with chemotherapy have been frequently observed among patients with BRAF V600_mutated CRC, although similarly low response rates in this patient population were also often observed to chemotherapy alone; additionally, response rates were generally lower for patients with BRAF_mutated tumors than for those whose tumors were BRAF_wildtype (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Peeters et al., 2013; 23325582, Seymour et al., 2013; 23725851, Karapetis et al., 2014; 24218517, Di Nicolantonio et al., 2008; 19001320, Stintzing et al., 2017; 28463756, Tol et al., 2009; 19571295). For a limited number of patients with CRC treated with cetuximab_ or panitumumab_containing chemotherapy regimens, BRAF V600E was found to be present at the time of progression (Freeman et al., 2008; 18621636, Gao et al., 2011; 23357879, Soeda et al., 2013; 22638623, Molinari et al., 2011; 21632860, Andre et al., 2013; 23041588, Benvenuti et al., 2007; 17363584), to be a mechanism of acquired (Arena et al., 2015; 25623215, Montagut et al., 2012; 22270724) or primary (Todelo et al., 2017; 27852040) resistance, or to be enriched in tumors of non_responders versus responders (Molinari et al., 2011; 21632860).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "BRAF activating alterations may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of BRAF, MEK, or ERK.

The Phase 3 BEACON study for previously treated patients with BRAF V600E_mutated metastatic CRC demonstrated significantly improved efficacy of encorafenib and cetuximab doublet therapy over standard irinotecan and cetuximab therapy (median OS [mOS] of 9.3 vs. 5.9 months, HR=0.61; median PFS [mPFS] of 4.3 vs. 1.5 months, HR=0.44; ORR of 20% vs. 1.8%) (Tabernero et al., 2021; 33503393, Kopetz et al., 2019; 31566309).

However, significant clinical responses have been reported for patients with BRAF V600E_mutated CRC upon treatment with panitumumab in combination with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor trametinib (Bendell et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 3515). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> Panitumumab has been shown to improve OS, PFS, and ORR for patients with KRAS_wildtype colorectal cancer (CRC), both in combination with FOLFOX4, FOLFIRI, irinotecan, or best supportive care (Douillard et al., 2014; 24718886, Peeters et al., 2015; 26341920, Watanabe et al., 2022; 35723084, Kim et al., 2018; 29703606, Shitara et al., 2016; 27712015), and as monotherapy for chemotherapy_refractory patients (Price et al., 2014; 24739896, Van Cutsem et al., 2007; 17470858, Peeters et al., 2013; 23325582). The Phase 3 PARADIGM trial comparing panitumumab plus mFOLFOX6 versus bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6 as first_line treatment for patients with RAS_wildtype left_sided metastatic CRC demonstrated that treatment with panitumumab significantly improved median OS (mOS; 36.2 months vs. 31.3 months) compared with bevacizumab (Yoshino et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract LBA1). A Phase 2 trial reported that, for patients with unresectable RAS_wildtype colorectal adenocarcinoma treated with panitumumab plus FOLFOX4, maintenance with a combination of panitumumab plus fluorouracil and leucovorin was superior to panitumumab monotherapy (10_month PFS OF 59% vs. 49%)(Pietrantonio et al., 2019; 31268481). In the Phase 3 ASPECCT study, panitumumab was found to be non_inferior to cetuximab with respect to median OS (10.4 vs. 10.0 months, HR=0.97) for patients with previously treated KRAS exon 2 wildtype metastatic colorectal cancer; median PFS was also similar between the two treatment groups (4.4 vs. 4.1 months, HR=1.00)(Price et al., 2014; 24739896). In a similar patient population, a Phase 2 study of combination panitumumab and irinotecan versus combination cetuximab and irinotecan also demonstrated non_inferiority with respect to median PFS (5.4 vs. 4.3 months, HR = 0.64) and median OS (14.9 vs. 11.5 months, HR=0.66)(Sakai et al., 2020; 32526634). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Resistant", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS colorectal cancers (CRCs) make up 70_85% of CRC cases (Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894). MSS colorectal cancers are molecularly heterogeneous, driven by diverse mechanisms such as extensive DNA methylation, oncogenic mutations in KRAS or BRAF, or chromosomal instability (Jass, 2007; 17204026). Multiple studies have shown that MSS CRCs have a worse prognosis than MSI_high tumors (Samowitz et al., 2001; 11535541, Elsaleh and Iacopetta, 2001; 12445368, Brueckl et al., 2003; 12820457, Guidoboni et al., 2001; 11438476, Gryfe et al., 2000; 10631274, Sinicrope et al., 2006; 16952542, Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Laghi and Malesci, 2012; 22722556). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60). For patients with chemotherapy_refractory microsatellite_stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), a Phase 3 trial reported no OS advantage from the combination of the PD_L1 inhibitor atezolizumab plus cobimetinib relative to regorafenib (8.9 vs. 8.5 months, HR=1.00); atezolizumab monotherapy similarly did not prolong OS (7.1 vs. 8.5 months, HR=1.19) (Ciardiello et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract LBA_004). For patients with MSS CRC, a Phase 2 study combining ipilimumab and nivolumab reported an overall DCR of 25% (10/40) (Parikh et al., 2021; DOI: 10.1038/s43018_021_00269_7). Two Phase 1 studies for patients with MSS CRC treated with regorafenib and nivolumab reported PFSs of 7.9 months (Fukuoka et al., 2020; 32343640) and 5.7 months (Kim et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1016/j.annonc.2020.04.073), and a patient with MSS CRC refractory to chemotherapy treated with the PD_1 inhibitor sintilimab and regorafenib reported a CR (Zhang et al., 2021; 34688262). MSI has not been found to be a predictive biomarker for combination chemotherapy regimens, including FOLFOX (Sinicrope et al., 2013; 24019539, Gavin et al., 2012; 23045248) and FOLFIRI (Bertagnolli et al., 2009; 19273709, Van Cutsem et al., 2009; 19451425). Patients with MSS CRC are more likely to benefit from postsurgical fluorouracil (FU)_based adjuvant therapy (Ribic et al., 2003; 12867608, Sargent et al., 2010; 20498393) but less likely to benefit from irinotecan chemotherapy (Fallik et al., 2003; 14522894).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "NRAS", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "wildtype", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "wildtype"}}, "Interpretation": "NRAS encodes a member of the RAS family of small GTPases that mediate transduction of growth signals.

No alterations in NRAS were identified in this case. The majority of colorectal cancers (CRCs) (91_98%) have been reported to lack NRAS mutations (Pentheroudakis et al., 2013; 23374602, Vaughn et al., 2011; 21305640, Janku et al., 2013; 23400451, De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739, Irahara et al., 2010; 20736745, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Schirripa et al., 2015; 24806288, Guo et al., 2018; 29666387).

A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "04", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "04"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Fabrizio et al., 2018; 30151257, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526). Elevated tumor mutational burden (TMB) has been reported in 8_25% of colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (George et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3587, Nagahashi et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e15103, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117, Shao et al., 2020; 33119110). Multiple studies have reported that up to 90% of hypermutated CRC cases exhibit high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI_H) and mismatch repair deficiency (MMR_D) (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). Increased TMB is significantly associated with MSI_H and MMR_D, with studies reporting that 100% of MSI_H CRCs harbor elevated TMB and conversely that 100% of tumors with low TMB harbor intact MMR (George et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3587, Nagahashi et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e15103, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). A subset of CRCs that harbor increased TMB but not MSI_H are driven by mutations in POLE, which leads to an \u201cultramutated\u201d phenotype with especially high TMB (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). Tumors with increased TMB harbor BRAF V600E mutations more frequently than those with low TMB (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117), whereas TMB_low tumors more frequently harbor mutations in TP53 and APC (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696). The prognostic value of tumor mutational burden (TMB) in colorectal cancer (CRC) is context_ and therapy_dependent. A study of tissue TMB (tTMB) in 145 CRC samples showed longer OS in TMB_high samples compared with TMB_low ones (Schwartz et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 572). Similarly, for patients with metastatic CRC treated with first_line chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab or cetuximab, high tissue TMB (tTMB_H) was associated with longer OS (Innocenti et al., 2019; 30865548). For patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, tTMB_H was associated with better 5_year relapse_free survival (Lee et al., 2019; 31285374). However, for patients with EGFR/BRAF_inhibitor_treated, BRAF_mutated microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic CRC, intermediate tTMB was associated with significantly poorer PFS and OS compared with TMB_low status; patients with primary resistance to EGFR/BRAF blockage had higher TMB than those sensitive to these therapies (Randon et al., 2022; 34933155). In a study for 61 patients with metastatic, MSS CRC treated with best standard of care, plasma TMB scores \u226528 Muts/Mb (approximately 14 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) were associated with reduced OS compared with plasma TMB scores <28 Muts/Mb (3.0 vs. 5.3 months, HR=0.76, p=0.007), whereas tTMB was not found to be prognostic in this population (Chen et al., 2020; 32379280, Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, increased tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Ott et al., 2019; 30557521, Cristescu et al., 2022; 35101941, Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). In the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors, significant improvement in ORR was observed for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) compared with those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526); similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). At the same TMB cutpoint, retrospective analysis of patients with solid tumors treated with any checkpoint inhibitor identified that tissue TMB scores \u2265 10 Muts/Mb were associated with prolonged time to treatment failure compared with scores <10 muts/Mb (HR=0.68) (Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). For patients with solid tumors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the CheckMate 848 trial, improved responses were observed in patients with a tissue TMB \u2265 10 Muts/Mb independent of blood TMB at any cutpoint in matched samples (Schenker at al., 2022; AACR Abstract 7845). However, support for higher TMB thresholds and efficacy was observed in the prospective Phase 2 MyPathway trial of atezolizumab for patients with pan_solid tumors, where improved ORR and DCR was seen in patients with TMB \u2265 16 Muts/Mb than those with TMB \u2265 10 and <16 Muts/Mb (Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409). Similarly, analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386). In CRC specifically, a retrospective analysis of immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy reported significantly improved OS for patients with tumors harboring TMB \u22659.8 Muts/MB compared with those with tumors with TMB <9.8 Muts/Mb (~ equivalency <12 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254). Another retrospective study reported that a TMB \u226512 Muts/Mb cutoff identifies >99% of MSI_High CRC cases but only 3% of MSS cases, indicating the utility of this cutoff for identification of patients with CRC likely to benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Fabrizio et al., 2018;
