In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). EGFR L858 is located in the kinase domain and is encoded by exon 21. EGFR L858R has been characterized as activating (Lynch et al., 2004; 15118073, Paez et al., 2004; 15118125, Pao et al., 2004; 15329413) and patients with the L858R mutation have been shown to be sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as erlotinib, gefitinib (Lynch et al., 2004; 15118073, Paez et al., 2004; 15118125, Pao et al., 2004; 15329413), and afatinib (Yang et al., 2015; 25589191). EGFR mutation has been reported in 12_36% of lung adenocarcinomas (Vallee et al., 2013; 23934203, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552) and in 4% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745). EGFR protein expression/overexpression has been reported in up to 70% of NSCLC cases (Watzka et al., 2010; 20353893, Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Grob et al., 2013; 23238037, Park et al., 2012; 22207554, Dobashi et al., 2011; 21040950, Ludovini et al., 2013; 23314677). In addition, expression of EGFR protein has been shown to be higher in lung squamous cell carcinoma samples as compared to lung adenocarcinoma (Skrzypski et al., 2013; 23870818, Kim et al., 2012; 22419022). In patients with lung adenocarcinoma, EGFR mutation was a predictor of poor overall survival (Lee et al., 2013; 23525704, Oakley and Chiosea, 2011; 21587084). However, EGFR mutations have been reported to predict improved survival in patients with resected Stage 1_3 lung adenocarcinoma (Marks et al., 2008; 18303429) or resected Stage 1 NSCLC (Izar et al., 2013; 23932319). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer, EGFR activating mutations may predict sensitivity to EGFR TKIs, including erlotinib (Rosell et al., 2011; 22285168), gefitinib (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064), afatinib (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960), dacomitinib (Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), and osimertinib (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549); however, the data for patients with other tumor types are limited (Hong et al., 2020; 32749686, Kim et al., 2015; 26462025, Kim et al., 2015; 25424851, Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840, Cavalieri et al., 2018; 29734047, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Audet et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 6041). The Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study of amivantamab monotherapy or in combination with lazertinib for the treatment of EGFR_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has produced encouraging preliminary results for treatment_naive patients and patients who relapsed after treatment with osimertinib with and without chemotherapy, including osimertinib_relapsed patients with biomarkers indicating EGFR/MET_based osimertinib resistance (Leighl et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 1192MO, Cho et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 1258O, Bauml et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9006, Shu et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 1193MO). In a Phase 1 trial, the HER3_targeted antibody patritumab deruxtecan elicited an ORR of 39% (22/57, 1 CR) and a median PFS of 8.2 months for patients with non_small cell lung cancer previously treated with an EGFR TKI, many of whom displayed TKI resistance alterations (Janne et al., 2022; 34548309). A Phase 1 trial evaluating the EGFR inhibitor AZD3759 reported a reduction in the volume of brain metastases in 40% (8/20) of patients with previously treated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring either the EGFR L858R alteration or EGFR exon 19 deletion, including 3 confirmed PRs and 3 unconfirmed PRs (Ahn et al., 2017; 29056570, Yang et al., 2016; 27928026). In a Phase 1/2 trial for advanced NSCLC, the brain_penetrant third_generation EGFR TKI lazertinib enabled ORRs of 54% (69/127) for all evaluable patients and 44% (8/18, intracranial) for patients with brain metastases (Ahn et al., 2019; 31587882). A Phase 1 trial evaluating the irreversible pan_HER inhibitor FCN_411 for NSCLC patients who had EGFR mutations and experienced disease progression on standard treatments reported an ORR of 15% with 10/67 patients achieving PR, and a DCR of 73% with 39 additional patients achieving SD (Lin et al., 2022; 35248866). OR was observed in a numerically higher proportion of patients with the EGFR T790M mutation than those without this mutation (Lin et al., 2022; 35248866). Patients with EGFR_mutated non_squamous metastatic non_small cell lung cancer previously treated with EGFR TKI have benefited from immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with anti_angiogenic and chemotherapy, particularly atezolizumab plus bevacizumab plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (OS HR 0.61 compared with bevacizumab/chemotherapy) (Reck et al., 2019; 30922878, Socinski et al., 2021; 34311108, Socinski et al., 2018; 29863955) or sintilimab plus bevacizumab biosimilar plus cisplatin and pemetrexed (PFS HR 0.46 compared with chemotherapy alone) (Lu et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract VP9_2021).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

Two randomized Phase 3 trials reported significantly improved median PFS from afatinib compared with chemotherapy for patients with EGFR common sensitizing mutations (LUX_Lung 3, 13.6 vs. 6.9 months, HR 0.47, p<0.001; LUX_Lung 6, 11.0 vs. 5.6 months, HR 0.28, p<0.0001) (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960, Wu et al., 2014; 24439929). However, while afatinib significantly increased OS relative to chemotherapy for patients with EGFR exon 19 alterations in these two trials (LUX_Lung 3, 33.3 vs. 21.1 months, HR=0.54; LUX_Lung 6, 31.4 vs. 18.4 months, HR=0.64), no significant OS differences were observed in treatment for patients with L858R mutation (Yang et al., 2015; 25589191). A similar alteration_specific difference was observed for EGFR_mutated treatment_naive NSCLC in a retrospective analysis, which reported numerically longer median OS from second_ versus first_generation EGFR TKIs (48.8 vs. 26.4 months, HR=0.59) for patients with exon 19 deletions, but no substantial difference for patients with L858R (25.4 vs. 20.6 months, HR=0.90) (Lau et al., 2019; 31178389). A Phase 2b study of first_line afatinib compared with gefitinib, also for NSCLC with exon 19 deletions or L858R, reported similar median OS for the two therapies (27.9 vs. 24.5 months, HR=0.86) but significantly longer time_to_treatment_failure (13.7 vs. 11.5 months, HR=0.75) and higher ORR (73% vs. 56%, p=0.0018) with afatinib (Paz_Ares et al., 2017; 28426106). Patients with metastatic NSCLC and common EGFR mutations who progressed on prior chemotherapy experienced an ORR of 50.0% (30/60) from afatinib in a Phase 4 trial (Thongprasert et al., 2019; 31807143). As first_line therapy for NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletions or L858R, prospective or randomized Phase 2 trials have reported a median PFS of 10.2 months and OS of 24.8 months for patients unfit for chemotherapy (Januszewski et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.13_17) and an ORR of 72.5% (n=40, 1 CR), DCR of 100% (40/40), and median PFS and OS of 15.2 and 30.0 months, respectively, for elderly patients \u226570 years old (Suzuki et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_92). A retrospective study of afatinib administered to Asian patients with NSCLC, 99% of whom were previously treated with erlotinib and/or gefitinib, reported an ORR of 27.4% (63/230) for patients with common sensitizing EGFR mutations and an ORR of 24.4% (105/431) for the entire cohort (Chang et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_11). In a case report, a patient with NSCLC with exon 19 deletion and leptomeningeal metastases experienced an ongoing 16_month PR from afatinib in extracranial, brain, and leptomeningeal lesions (Llin\u00e1s_Quintero et al., 2019; 31637072). For patients with erlotinib_ or gefitinib_resistant NSCLC and EGFR mutations, Phase 2/3 studies of afatinib treatment have generally reported ORRs of only 7 to 9% (Miller et al., 2012; 22452896, Chen et al., 2013; 23664448, Katakami et al., 2013; 23816963, Landi et al., 2014; 25242668, De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2015; 25682316, Yang et al., 2015; 26051236); however, DCRs of more than 50% have been observed (De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2015; 25682316). In a Phase 1b or observational study, patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC who progressed on afatinib experienced further clinical benefit from subsequent treatment with afatinib and cetuximab (Horn et al., 2017; 29110849) or osimertinib (Yamamoto et al., 2020; 31863283), respectively. Extensive clinical data have demonstrated that afatinib is effective for patients with EGFR_mutated advanced NSCLC, including exon 19 deletions and L858 mutations, as well as uncommon sensitizing mutations in exons 18 or 20 (Januszewski et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.13_17, Chang et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_11, Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960, Wu et al., 2014; 24439929, Yang et al., 2015; 25589191, Soria et al., 2015; 26156651, Paz_Ares et al., 2017; 28426106). Afatinib has also shown activity for patients with advanced NSCLC and ERBB2 mutations, most of which were exon 20 insertions (Dziadziuszko et al., 2019; 30825613, Lai et al., 2019; 30685684, Greulich et al., 2012; 22908275, Gow et al., 2015; 26134234, Mazi\u00e8res et al., 2016; 26598547, Mazi\u00e8res et al., 2013; 23610105, De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2015; 25682316, De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2012; 22325357, Li et al., 2015; 26559459, Costa et al., 2016; 26964772, Yuan et al., 2020; 32477948, Fang et al., 2019; 31748336). The randomized Phase 3 LUX_Lung 8 trial comparing afatinib with erlotinib as second_line therapy for advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) reported significantly longer median OS (7.9 vs. 6.8 months, HR=0.81), significantly longer median PFS (2.6 vs. 1.9 months, HR=0.81), and higher DCR (51% vs. 40%, p=0.002) for patients treated with afatinib (Soria et al., 2015; 26156651).

For patients with activating mutations in EGFR, treatment with erlotinib has been associated with improved response and lengthened time to progression (Cappuzzo et al., 2010; 20493771, Rosell et al., 2012; 22285168, Zhong et al., 2019; 31194613, Petrelli et al., 2011; 22056888). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> For patients with EGFR_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the Phase 3 EURTAC trial improved PFS with first_line erlotinib relative to platinum_based chemotherapy (9.7 vs. 5.2 months, HR=0.37), though OS was not prolonged (22.9 vs 19.6 months, HR=0.92)(Rosell et al., 2012; 22285168, Leon et al., 2014; doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdu349.52). This study and meta_analyses attribute the lack of OS benefit to the effectiveness of post_progression salvage therapy in the control arm (Lee et al., 2017; 28376144). A Phase 3 study reported similar efficacy of erlotinib and gefitinib for patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC (Yang et al., 2017; 28103612). Patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC have experienced PFS benefit with the addition of bevacizumab to erlotinib in the first_line setting in Phase 3 trials including the ARTEMIS_CTONG1509 trial for Chinese patients (17.9 vs. 11.2 months, HR=0.55)(Zhou et al., 2021; 34388377), the NEJ026 trial for Japanese patients (16.9 vs. 13.3 months, HR=0.605)(Kawashima et al., 2022; 34454653, Saito et al., 2019; 30975627), and the international BEVERLY trial (15.4 vs. 9.7 months, HR=0.60)(Piccirillo et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 12070); OS benefit has not been observed across these studies. In the maintenance setting, Phase 3 trials have reported significantly improved PFS with maintenance erlotinib following first_line platinum_based chemotherapy, with the largest benefit for patients with EGFR mutations (Cappuzzo et al., 2010; 20493771, Faehling et al., 2018; 29687154). In the neoadjuvant setting, a Phase 2 trial reported a numerically improved ORR and significantly longer PFS with erlotinib compared with chemotherapy for patients with EGFR_mutated advanced NSCLC (Zhong et al., 2019; 31194613). In the placebo_controlled Phase 3 RELAY trial, the addition of ramucirumab to erlotinib improved PFS for previously untreated patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR L858R or exon 19 deletion (19.4 vs. 12.4 months, HR=0.59)(Nakagawa et al., 2019; 31591063). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Osimertinib", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Osimertinib is an irreversible EGFR TKI that is selective for EGFR TKI_sensitizing mutations and the EGFR T790M mutation.

A Phase 1 study reported that T790M_negative patients with acquired EGFR TKI resistance experienced an ORR of 21% and a median PFS of 2.8 months (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549).

A Phase 2 trial of osimertinib in combination with bevacizumab versus osimertinib monotherapy for patients with untreated advanced non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR del19 or L858R reported no difference in ORR (82% vs 86%) and median PFS (22.1 vs 20.2 months, HR 0.862 p=0.213) (Kenmotsu et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA44).

High bTMB levels were not detected in this sample. It is unclear whether the bTMB levels in this sample would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Depending on the clinical context, TMB testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. NSCLC harbors a median bTMB of 16.8 Muts/Mb (range 1.9_52.5 Muts/Mb)(Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950). Retrospective analysis of the Phase 3 OAK and Phase 2 POPLAR trials for patients with advanced or metastatic non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) reported that bTMB \u22657 Muts/Mb was associated with shorter PFS (2.8 vs. 4.2 months) and OS (7.4 vs. 11.9 months) compared with bTMB <7 Muts/Mb for patients treated with docetaxel (Nie et al., 2020; 32380463). In one study of advanced NSCLC in China, bTMB \u22656 Muts/Mb was associated with decreased PFS (10 vs. 18 months) and OS (11 vs. 25 months) compared with bTMB <6 Muts/Mb for patients treated with platinum_based chemotherapy (Ma et al., 2021; 34055609). A large study of Chinese patients with lung adenocarcinoma reported a shorter median OS for tumors with a higher number of mutations in a limited gene set compared with a lower mutation number (48.4 vs. 61.0 months)(Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843). Another study of patients with NSCLC correlated elevated TMB with poorer prognosis and significantly associated lower TMB in combination with PD_L1 negative status with longer median survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). However, no significant prognostic association of TMB and/or PD_L1 status with survival has been reported in patients with lung SCC (Yu et al., 2019; 30253973, Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). On the basis of clinical evidence in NSCLC and HSNCC, increased bTMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511) and anti_PD_1 (Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074) therapies. In NSCLC, multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 to 16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). In HNSCC, a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Cannot Be Determined", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Cannot Be Determined"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI_H is generally infrequent in NSCLC, reported in fewer than 1% of samples across several large studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197, Ninomiya et al., 2006; 16641899, Vanderwalde et al., 2018; 29436178, Zang et al., 2019; 31270941, Dudley et al., 2016; 26880610, Takamochi et al., 2017; 28676214, Schrock et al., 2017; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2016.11.487), whereas data on the reported incidence of MSI_H in SCLC has been limited and conflicting (Pylkkanen et al., 1997; 9329646, Gonzalez et al., 2000; 11061602, Chen et al., 1996; 8782463, Merlo et al., 1994; 8174113). One study reported MSI_H in lung adenocarcinoma patients with smoking history, and 3 of 4 MSI_H patients examined also had metachronous carcinomas in other organs, although this has not been investigated in large scale studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of MSI in NSCLC are limited (PubMed, Oct 2021).

The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with elevated tumor fraction values have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus high sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at low risk of false negative results. However, if elevated tumor fraction is not detected, it does not exclude the presence of disease burden or compromise the confidence of reported alterations. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another.
