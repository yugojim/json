Mutation, loss, or inactivation of ARID1A has been reported in many cancers, and the gene is considered a tumor suppressor (Guan et al., 2011; 21900401, Jones et al., 2012; 22009941, Wiegand et al., 2010; 20942669, Jones et al., 2010; 20826764, Yan et al., 2014; 24293408, Wang et al., 2012; 22808142, Huang et al., 2012; 22922871, Chan_On et al., 2013; 24185513, Mamo et al., 2012; 21892209). ARID1A mutations, which are mostly truncating, have been identified along the entire gene and often correlate with ARID1A protein loss (Jones et al., 2012; 22009941, Wiegand et al., 2010; 20942669, Jones et al., 2010; 20826764, Zang et al., 2012; 22484628, Wang et al., 2011; 22037554), whereas ARID1A missense mutations are mostly uncharacterized. ARID1A alterations are particularly prevalent in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (46_50%), ovarian and uterine endometrioid carcinomas (24_44%), and cholangiocarcinoma (27%); they are also reported in up to 27% of gastric carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, pediatric Burkitt lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, and urothelial carcinoma samples analyzed (COSMIC, cBioPortal, 2021) (Tate et al., 2019; 30371878, Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Wu et al., 2014; 24618703, Jones et al., 2012; 22009941, Dulak et al., 2013; 23525077, Streppel et al., 2013; 23318448, Jiao et al., 2014; 24293293, Ross et al., 2014; 24563076). ARID1A loss is associated with microsatellite instability in ovarian and endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinomas (Huang et al., 2014; 25195947, Hussein et al., 2014; 25394778, Bosse et al., 2013; 23702729, Allo et al., 2014; 23887303, Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729), CRC (Chou et al., 2014; 24925223, Ye et al., 2014; 25311944, Wei et al., 2014; 25561809, Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729), and gastric cancer (Chen et al., 2015; 25583476, Wang et al., 2011; 22037554, Abe et al., 2012; 22915242, Wang et al., 2012; 22808142, Wiegand et al., 2014; 24767857, Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729). Several studies have reported no correlation between ARID1A loss and clinicopathological parameters in ovarian clear cell or endometrioid carcinomas or other endometrial cancers (Rahman et al., 2013; 22939958, Maeda et al., 2010; 21614196, Lowery et al., 2012; 22193641, Fadare et al., 2013; 23524907), whereas others suggest that ARID1A loss is a negative prognostic factor (Mao et al., 2013; 24076775, Katagiri et al., 2012; 22101352). There are no therapies approved to address the mutation or loss of ARID1A in cancer. However, on the basis of limited clinical and preclinical evidence, ARID1A inactivating mutations may lead to sensitivity to ATR inhibitors such as M6620 and ceralasertib (Williamson et al., 2016; 27958275). In a Phase 2 study of ceralasertib in solid tumors, 2 patients with endometrial carcinoma in the cohort with loss of ARID1A expression achieved CRs on ceralasertib monotherapy; at least 1 of these 2 patients carried an inactivating ARID1A mutation. In contrast, no responses were observed for patients with normal ARID1A expression treated with ceralasertib combined with olaparib (Aggarwal et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 512O). One patient with small cell lung cancer harboring an ARID1A mutation experienced a PR when treated with M6620 combined with topotecan (Thomas et al., 2018; 29252124). In a Phase 1 trial, a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer harboring both an ARID1A mutation and ATM loss treated with single_agent M6620 achieved a CR that was ongoing at 29 months (Yap et al., 2020; 32568634). On the basis of limited preclinical evidence from studies in ovarian cancer, ARID1A inactivation may predict sensitivity to EZH2 inhibitors (Bitler et al., 2015; 25686104, Kim et al., 2015; 26552009), which are under investigation in clinical trials. Other studies have reported that the loss of ARID1A may activate the PI3K_AKT pathway and be linked with sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway (Wiegand et al., 2014; 24559118, Huang et al., 2014; 24336158, Samartzis et al., 2014; 24979463). Patients with ARID1A alterations in advanced or metastatic solid tumors may derive benefit from treatment with anti_PD_1 or anti_PD_L1 immunotherapy (Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729). Loss of ARID1A expression has been associated with chemoresistance to platinum_based therapy for patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma (Yokoyama et al., 2014; 24459582, Katagiri et al., 2012; 22101352) and to 5_fluorouracil in colorectal cancer cell lines (Xie et al., 2014; 24833095).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "ARID1A loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to ATR inhibitors.

The PI3K pathway is involved in cell signaling that regulates a number of critical cellular functions, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival (Samuels et al., 2005; 15950905, Engelman, 2009; 19629070). PIK3CA alterations that have been characterized as activating, such as observed here, are predicted to be oncogenic (Kang et al., 2005; 15647370, Ikenoue et al., 2005; 15930273, Gymnopoulos et al., 2007; 17376864, Horn et al., 2008; 18317450, Rudd et al., 2011; 21266528, Hon et al., 2012; 22120714, Burke et al., 2012; 22949682, Wu et al., 2009; 19915146, Dbouk et al., 2010; 2103068, Dan et al., 2010; 20530683, Oda et al., 2008; 18829572, Zhao and Vogt, 2008; 18794883, Lui et al., 2013; 23619167, Ross et al., 2013; 22430209, Riviere et al., 2012; 22729224, Shibata et al., 2009; 19394761, Droguluk et al., 2015; 26627007,Croessmann et al., 2018; 29284706, Ng et al., 2018; 29533785, Spangle et al., 2020; 32929011, Chen et al., 2018; 29636477). PIK3CA mutation frequency is variable among different subtypes of ovarian cancer. Mutations were detected in 33% of clear cell carcinomas and in 12% of advanced epithelial ovarian carcinomas; however, PIK3CA mutations were detected in 3% of high_grade serous ovarian cancers and in fewer than 1% of tumors in the TCGA Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma dataset (Kuo et al., 2009; 19349352, Levine et al., 2005; 15837735, Matulonis et al., 2011; 21931712, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2011; 21720365). A study of ovarian clear cell carcinomas reported an association of coexistent alterations in ARID1A and PIK3CA with poor prognosis (Uehara et al., 2015; 26043110). There are differing reports on the impact of PIK3CA alteration on prognosis in patients with ovarian carcinoma; PIK3CA mutation or overexpression was associated with favorable survival in patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma (Rahman et al., 2012; 22705003, Abe et al., 2013; 22955107), whereas PIK3CA amplification has been associated with higher grade ovarian tumors (Carden et al., 2012; 22556379, Kolasa et al., 2009; 19029838, Nakayama et al., 2007; 17351921) and with shorter survival in patients with ovarian cancer in general (Kato et al., 2007; 17590872, Woenckhaus et al., 2007; 17377809, Niskakoski et al., 2013; 23716351, Huang et al., 2011; 21563232). Clinical and preclinical data in various tumor types indicate that PIK3CA activating alterations may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting PI3K (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574, Juric et al., 2018; 29401002, Gallant et al., 2019; 30793038), AKT (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Smyth et al., 2021; 33863913), or mTOR (Park et al., 2016; 27105424, Lim et al., 2016; 26859683, Hou et al., 2014; 25426553, Varnier et al., 2019; 31351267, Janku et al., 2014; 24440717, Moroney et al., 2012; 22927482, Basho et al., 2017; 27893038, Moroney et al., 2011; 21890452). In the Phase 2 MATCH trial for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors, 28% (18/65) of patients experienced PFS lasting at least 6 months after treatment with taselisib; however, no ORs were observed in this study (Krop et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 101). A separate Phase 1b study of taselisib in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors reported an ORR of 0% (n=12) and a DCR of 17% (2/12) (Pascual et al., 2021; 32958578). In a Phase 1 trial of the dual PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitor apitolisib, 79% (11/14) of patients with PIK3CA_mutated advanced solid tumors experienced disease control (3 PRs, 8 SDs) (Dolly et al., 2016; 26787751). The PI3K inhibitor alpelisib demonstrated an ORR of 6.0% (8/134) and a DCR of 58% (78/134) in a study for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors (Juric et al., 2018; 2941002). However, the PI3K inhibitor copanlisib exhibited limited efficacy in PIK3CA_mutated tumors (Santin et al., 2020; 31934607, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PIK3CA activating mutations may lead to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may therefore indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.

In a study of more than 4,000 ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer samples, genomic LOH score \u2265 16% was identified in 24.2% of BRCA1/2 wild_type cases, deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation was identified in an additional 17.2% of cases, and the remaining 58.7% of cases had LOH score < 16% and were BRCA1/2 wild_type (Elvin et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 5512). Among the histological subtypes, LOH score \u2265 16% or BRCA1/2 mutation was reported in 42.4% of serous carcinomas, 37.6% of endometrioid carcinomas, 23.5% of carcinosarcomas, 20.6% of neuroendocrine carcinomas, 13.6% of clear cell carcinomas, and 8.1% of mucinous carcinomas; in BRCA1/2 wild_type samples, the median LOH score was significantly higher in serous as compared with non_serous cases (Elvin et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 5512). In ovarian carcinoma, the median LOH score is significantly higher for BRCA1/2_mutated cases than BRCA1/2 wild_type cases (22.2% vs. 9.8%) (Elvin et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 5512), and mutation or methylation of BRCA1, BRCA2, or RAD51C has been reported to be enriched in cases with increased genomic LOH (Wang et al., 2012; 22912389, Abkevich et al., 2012; 23047548). One study reported no association between LOH and either tumor stage or grade in ovarian serous carcinoma (Marquard et al., 2015; 26015868). In patients with high_grade serous ovarian carcinoma, the frequency of LOH has been reported to increase significantly with age (Pedersen et al., 2013; 23716468). On the basis of emerging clinical data in ovarian cancer, elevated genomic LOH may be associated with greater sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Coleman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5540, Coleman et al., 2017; 28916367, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). In platinum_sensitive, BRCA1/2 wild_type ovarian, peritoneal, or Fallopian tube carcinoma, rucaparib elicited significantly longer median PFS (7.2 vs. 5.0 months, HR=0.51) and improved ORR (33.3% vs. 9.6%, p=0.0003) for patients with LOH score \u2265 16% (Coleman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5540, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). In the maintenance setting in platinum_sensitive, BRCA1/2 wild_type patients, rucaparib was superior to placebo in both the LOH score \u2265 16% (median PFS, 9.7 vs. 5.4 months; HR=0.44) and LOH score < 16% (median PFS, 6.7 vs. 5.4 months; HR=0.58) cohorts (Coleman et al., 2017; 28916367). Similar results have been reported for maintenance treatment with niraparib in ovarian cancer (Mirza et al., 2016; 27717299) when using a different measure of HRD that includes genomic LOH (Telli et al., 2016; 26957554, Timms et al., 2014; 25475740). Increased LOH has also been associated with improved sensitivity to platinum_containing chemotherapy regimens in patients with ovarian or breast cancer (Wang et al., 2012; 22912389, Telli et al., 2015; 25847929, Isakoff et al., 2015; 25847936).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI_high (MSI_H) has been reported in 1.6_19.7% of ovarian cancer samples (Segev et al., 2015; 26775351, Plisiecka_Ha\u0142asa et al., 2008; 18507046), including 3.8% (1/26) of ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinomas (Huang et al., 2015; 25195947), and 10.0% (3/30) of ovarian clear cell carcinomas (CCOCs) (Strickland et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5514). No association of MSI_H with stage or survival was found in patients with ovarian cancer (Segev et al., 2015; 26775351, Aysal et al., 2012; 22189970). On the basis of prospective clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD_1_targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143) and PD_L1_targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92). As the MSI status of this tumor is unknown, the relevance of these therapeutic approaches is unclear. While approximately 80% of MSI_H tumors arise due to somatic inactivation of an MMR pathway protein, about 20% arise due to germline mutations in one of the MMR genes (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942), which are associated with a condition known as Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC) (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756). Lynch syndrome leads to an increased risk of colorectal, endometrial, gastric, and other cancers (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756, Pande et al., 2012; 22714864, Kastrinos and Syngal, 2007; 17920897) and has an estimated prevalence in the general population ranging from 1:600 to 1:2000 (Silva et al., 2009; 19466295, Sehgal et al., 2014; 24978665, de la Chapelle et al., 2005; 16136383).

A spatially constrained pattern of somatic missense alterations in PPP2R1A, clustered around codons 179, 182, and 256, has been documented (McConechy et al, 2012; 22653804, Shih et al., 2011; 21435433, McConechy et al., 2011; 21381030, Zhao et al., 2013; 23359684, Kuhn et al., 2012; 22923510). Although the functional consequences of these PPP2R1A alterations have not been clearly characterized, they are presumed to disrupt binding of the PP2A regulatory and catalytic subunits, dysregulating normal PP2A function and cell cycle progression (McConechy et al., 2011; 21381030). PPP2R1A mutations have been reported in several subtypes of ovarian and uterine carcinoma, most frequently in uterine serous carcinoma (up to 26%) (COSMIC, cBioPortal, 2021)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878, Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). In addition, concurrent mutations in PPP2R1A, PIK3CA, and TP53 have been reported in cases of uterine serous carcinoma, and were also found in associated serous endometrial intraepithelial carcinomas, suggesting the alterations arose early in the pre_invasive stage of the disease (Kuhn et all, 2012; 22923510). PPP2R1A mutations have been reported in 9/42 carcinosarcoma samples analyzed (McConechy et al, 2012; 22653804). There are no targeted therapies available to directly address genomic alterations in PPP2R1A. Activation of PP2A with forskolin or the sphingosine analogue FTY720 has be shown to be beneficial in the context of CML and ALL (Perrotti and Neviani, 2013; 23639323), and is being investigated in solid tumors of the lung, breast, and colon (Cristobal et al., 2014; 24448818, Saddoughi et al., 2013; 23180565, Baldacchino et al., 2014; 24460909). In addition, other agents have been shown to upregulate PP2A activity in the context of various tumors (Chen et al., 2013; 24307892). However, the efficacy of these compounds in the context of PPP2R1A mutations has not yet been evaluated (PubMed, 2021).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TET2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "E1151*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "E1151*"}}, "Interpretation": "TET2 encodes a tumor suppressor involved in reversing DNA methylation marks, a process critical for proper gene regulation (Ito et al., 2010; 20639862, Guo et al., 2011; 21496894).

TET2 alterations have been reported at relatively low frequencies in solid tumors and are more prevalent in hematological malignancies (cBioPortal, Jan 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of TET2 alterations in solid tumors are limited (PubMed, Jan 2021). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in TET2 in solid tumors. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

Elevated TMB has been reported to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors in multiple solid tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). However, the TMB level in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Ovarian clear cell carcinoma harbors a median TMB of 2.7 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 1.7% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). In a study of high grade serous ovarian cancer, homologous recombination (HR)_deficient tumors, which comprised ~50% of all samples, harbored a higher neoantigen load compared to HR_proficient tumors; higher neoantigen load was associated with longer OS but not disease free survival (Strickland et al., 2016; 26871470). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, higher TMB has been reported to be associated with increased ORR and OS from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). Higher TMB was found to be significantly associated with improved OS upon immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment for patients with 9 types of advanced tumors (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254). Analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy, compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386). However, the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors found significant improvement in ORR for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (based on this assay or others) compared to those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb, in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types; similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915).
