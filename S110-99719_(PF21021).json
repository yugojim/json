Loss of functional ATM promotes tumorigenesis (Cremona and Behrens, 2014; 23851492). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt ATM function or expression (Jiang et al., 2006; 16603769, Fernandes et al., 2005; 15713674, Scott et al., 2002; 11805335). In the Colorectal Adenocarcinoma TCGA dataset, ATM mutations have been reported in 11% of cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of ATM has been observed in 23_31% of distal colon cancers, but not in proximal colon tumors (Uhrhammer et al., 1999; 10203610). ATM expression or mutation has been associated with longer survival for patients with CRC (Grabsch et al., 2006; 16533773, Randon et al., 2019; 30814645). Loss of functional ATM results in a defective DNA damage response and homologous recombination_mediated DNA repair and may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Michels et al., 2014; 24037533). Clinical data in prostate cancer (Mateo et al., 2015; 26510020, Mateo et al., 2020; 31806540, de Bono et al., 2020; ASCO GU Abstract 119, Abida et al., 2020; 32086346), gastric cancer (Bang et al., 2015; 26282658), colorectal cancer (Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006), breast cancer (Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006), papillary renal cell carcinoma (Olson et al., 2016; 27079472), and cholangiocarcinoma (Piha_Paul et al., 2018; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract A096) indicate that loss or inactivation of ATM may confer sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Weston et al., 2010; 20739657, Williamson et al., 2010; 20124459, Gilardini et al., 2013; 24252502, Bryant and Helleday, 2006; 16556909, Ihnen et al., 2013; 23729402, Williamson et al., 2012; 22416035, Kubota et al., 2014; 24841718, Huehls et al., 2012; 22833573). In Phase 1 trials of ATR inhibitors, a heavily pretreated patient with colorectal cancer who achieved a CR to berzosertib (O Carrigan et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2504) and 4 out of 4 patients with diverse solid tumors who achieved PRs to BAY1895344 (Yap et al., 2020; 32988960) harbored ATM inactivation or protein loss; studies showing reduced cell viability and increased DNA damage in preclinical models of solid tumors (Menezes et al., 2015; 25232030, Vendetti et al., 2015; 26517239, Min et al., 2017; 28138034) and hematologic malignancies (Menezes et al., 2015; 25232030, Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132) also support the increased sensitivity of ATM_deficient cells to ATR inhibitors. Preclinical experiments also indicate that loss of ATM causes dependency on DNA_PKcs in cancer cells; DNA_PKcs inhibitors promoted apoptosis in ATM_deficient cells and were active in a lymphoma mouse model lacking ATM activity (Riabinska et al., 2013; 23761041). ATM mutation carriers have increased cancer risk, with female carriers displaying a 38% lifetime risk of breast cancer (van Os et al., 2016; 26662178). Biallelic mutations in ATM underlie the rare autosomal_recessive inherited disorder ataxia_telangiectasia (A_T), also referred to as genome instability or DNA damage response syndrome (Rothblum_Oviatt et al., 2016; 27884168). This disease is characterized by genomic instability, sensitivity to DNA_damaging agents, and increased risk of developing cancer (Shiloh and Ziv, 2013; 23847781, Rothblum_Oviatt et al., 2016; 27884168). The prevalence of A_T is estimated at 1:40,000 to 1:100,000 worldwide (Rothblum_Oviatt et al., 2016; 27884168). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of ATM is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors may detect nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

Objective responses were observed for 80% (32/40) of patients with BRCA1/2 mutations, for 29% (24/82) with high LOH, and for 10% (7/10) with low LOH (Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). In heavily pretreated patients with a germline BRCA1/2 mutation who had received 2_4 prior chemotherapy treatments and had a progression free interval of greater than 6 months, 65% (17/26) of patients achieved an objective response with rucaparib treatment (Shapira_Frommer et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5513). In a Phase 2 study evaluating rucaparib for patients with advanced breast or ovarian cancer and germline BRCA1/2 mutations, disease control was observed in 92% (12/13) of patients with ovarian cancer treated with oral rucaparib dosed continuously, but no objective responses were reported in breast cancer patients (n=23). However, 39% (9/23) of evaluable patients with breast cancer achieved SD lasting 12 weeks or more (Drew et al., 2016; 27002934).

Mutations in KRAS have been reported in approximately 35_50% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) (Lievre et al., 2006; 16618717, De Roock et al., 2011; 21163703, Chen et al., 2014; 25367198, Li et al., 2015; 25929517, Hu et al., 2016; 27977612, Zekri et al., 2017; 28218784, Staudacher et al., 2017; 29048416, Wang et al., 2018; 29705968, Guo et al., 2018; 29666387). Numerous studies have reported that KRAS mutations are associated with increased metastasis, adverse clinicopathological features, and shorter survival of patients with CRC (Chen et al., 2014; 25367198, Li et al., 2015; 25929517, Hu et al., 2016; 27977612, M\u00e1rmol et al., 2017; 28106826, Zekri et al., 2017; 28218784, Kwak et al., 2017; 28858102). Preclinical and clinical data suggest that KRAS mutations may predict clinical benefit from SHP2 inhibitors (Lu et al., 2019; 31068384, Mainardi et al., 2018; 29808006, Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001, Brana et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3005, Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). A Phase 1 study of RMC_4630 for relapsed/refractory solid tumors reported a DCR of 58% (23/40) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS mutations and a DCR of 75% (12/16) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS G12C mutations (Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001). Interim results from a Phase 1/2 study of RMC_4630 plus cobimetinib reported tumor reduction in 3 of 8 patients with KRAS_mutated colorectal cancer (Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). Preclinical evidence suggests that KRAS activation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, such as trametinib, binimetinib, cobimetinib, and selumetinib (Nakano et al., 1984; 6320174, Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Yamaguchi et al., 2011; 21523318, Watanabe et al., 2013; 23438367, Gilmartin et al., 2011; 21245089, Yeh et al., 2009; 19372556). However, multiple clinical trials have reported lack of efficacy of trametinib and other MEK inhibitors when used as monotherapy for treatment of patients with KRAS_mutant CRC (Tsimberidou et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract e22086)(Infante et al., 2012; 22805291, Zimmer et al., 2014; 24947927, Bennouna et al., 2011; 20127139, Weekes et al., 2013; 23434733). Both clinical (Hochster et al., 2013; ASCO GI Abstract 380, Juric et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 9051) and preclinical (Lamba et al., 2014; 25199829, Sun et al, 2014; 24685132) studies suggest that combinatorial approaches including MEK inhibitors are likely to be more effective for the treatment of CRC, including strategies such as combination of MEK inhibitors with PI3K inhibitors (Juric et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 9051), RAF inhibitors (Lamba et al., 2014; 25199829), pan_ERBB inhibitors (Sun et al, 2014; 24685132), or chemotherapeutic agents (Hochster et al., 2013; ASCO GI Abstract 380). Preclinical and limited clinical evidence suggest that KRAS mutation may predict sensitivity to PLK1 inhibitors (Luo et al., 2009; 19490893, Lenz et al., 2020; ASCO GI Abstract TPS265). A Phase 1b/2 study of PLK1 inhibitor onvansertib in combination with FOLFIRI and bevacizumab for patients with KRAS_mutated metastatic CRC previously treated with chemotherapy reported an 87.5% (7/8; 3 PR, 4 SD) clinical benefit rate, with 1 patient going on to successful curative surgery (Barzi et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT235). Activating mutations in KRAS or NRAS are associated with lack of clinical benefit from cetuximab (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Bokemeyer et al., 2011; 21228335, Karapetis et al., 2008; 18946061, De Roock et al., 2008; 17998284) or panitumumab (Douillard et al., 2014; 24718886, Douillard et al., 2012; 24024839, Amado et al., 2008; 18316791) for patients with CRC.

PIK3CA alterations that have been characterized as activating, such as observed here, are predicted to be oncogenic (Kang et al., 2005; 15647370, Ikenoue et al., 2005; 15930273, Gymnopoulos et al., 2007; 17376864, Horn et al., 2008; 18317450, Rudd et al., 2011; 21266528, Hon et al., 2012; 22120714, Burke et al., 2012; 22949682, Wu et al., 2009; 19915146, Dbouk et al., 2010; 2103068, Dan et al., 2010; 20530683, Oda et al., 2008; 18829572, Zhao and Vogt, 2008; 18794883, Lui et al., 2013; 23619167, Ross et al., 2013; 22430209, Riviere et al., 2012; 22729224, Shibata et al., 2009; 19394761, Droguluk et al., 2015; 26627007,Croessmann et al., 2018; 29284706, Ng et al., 2018; 29533785, Spangle et al., 2020; 32929011, Chen et al., 2018; 29636477).

A meta_analysis of 864 patients with colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab_ or panitumumab_based therapy showed that PIK3CA mutations, particularly in exon 20 (H1047R), are significantly associated with worse response (Huang et al., 2014; 24701207) and shorter progression_free and overall survival (De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739). Clinical and preclinical data in various tumor types indicate that PIK3CA activating alterations may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting PI3K (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574, Juric et al., 2018; 29401002, Gallant et al., 2019; 30793038), AKT (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Smyth et al., 2021; 33863913), or mTOR (Park et al., 2016; 27105424, Lim et al., 2016; 26859683, Hou et al., 2014; 25426553, Varnier et al., 2019; 31351267, Janku et al., 2014; 24440717, Moroney et al., 2012; 22927482, Basho et al., 2017; 27893038, Moroney et al., 2011; 21890452). Emerging evidence suggests that the glutaminase inhibitor telaglenastat has clinical activity in PIK3CA_mutated colorectal cancer (CRC). A Phase 1 trial of telaglenastat and capecitabine for patients with CRC who progressed on fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy observed numerically increased median PFS for patients with PIK3CA mutation compared with patients with wildtype PIK3CA status (24.8 vs. 16 weeks, n=7 vs. n=4), including SD >30 weeks for 3 patients with PIK3CA mutation (Zhao et al., 2020; 32907836). Multiple clinical studies report that inhibitors of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway have not produced significant clinical benefit as monotherapies to treat CRC, even for tumors that harbor alterations in PIK3CA or PTEN; data are more limited for alterations in other genes in this pathway (Ng et al., 2013; 23743569, Ganesan et al., 2013; 24092809, Janku et al., 2014; 24440717).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947).

MSS colorectal cancers are molecularly heterogeneous, driven by diverse mechanisms such as extensive DNA methylation, oncogenic mutations in KRAS or BRAF, or chromosomal instability (Jass, 2007; 17204026). Multiple studies have shown that MSS CRCs have a worse prognosis than MSI_high tumors (Samowitz et al., 2001; 11535541, Elsaleh and Iacopetta, 2001; 12445368, Brueckl et al., 2003; 12820457, Guidoboni et al., 2001; 11438476, Gryfe et al., 2000; 10631274, Sinicrope et al., 2006; 16952542, Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Laghi and Malesci, 2012; 22722556). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255).

For patients with chemotherapy_refractory metastatic colorectal cancer, 92% of which were MSS or MSI_Intermediate, a Phase 3 trial reported no OS advantage from the combination of the PD_L1 inhibitor atezolizumab plus cobimetinib relative to regorafenib (8.9 vs. 8.5 months, HR=1.00); atezolizumab monotherapy similarly did not prolong OS (7.1 vs. 8.5 months, HR=1.19) (Ciardiello et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract LBA_004). MSI has not been found to be a predictive biomarker for combination chemotherapy regimens, including FOLFOX (Sinicrope et al., 2013; 24019539, Gavin et al., 2012; 23045248) and FOLFIRI (Bertagnolli et al., 2009; 19273709, Van Cutsem et al., 2009; 19451425). Patients with MSS CRC are more likely to benefit from postsurgical fluorouracil (FU)_based adjuvant therapy (Ribic et al., 2003; 12867608, Sargent et al., 2010; 20498393) but less likely to benefit from irinotecan chemotherapy (Fallik et al., 2003; 14522894).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "NRAS", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "wildtype", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "wildtype"}}, "Interpretation": "NRAS encodes a member of the RAS family of small GTPases that mediate transduction of growth signals.

SMAD4 alterations that result in loss or disruption of the MH1 domain (aa 18_142), MH2 domain (aa 323_552), or SAD domain (aa 275_320) are predicted to be inactivating (Massague et al., 2005; 16322555, Mor\u00e9n et al., 2000; 10980615, Xu and Attisano, 2000; 10781087, Luo et al., 1999; 10485843, Jones and Kern, 2000; 10871368, Fink et al., 2001; 11196171, De Bosscher et al., 2004; 14715079, Shi et al., 1997; 9214508, Miyaki et al., 1999; 10340381, Prokova et al., 2007; 17994767, Wu et al., 2001; 11274206, Ding et al., 2009; 19139564, Kuang et al., 2004; 14647410, Watanabe et al., 2000; 11265759, Bosscher et al., 2004; 14715079). SMAD4 mutation or homozygous deletion is most frequently observed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (43%)(cBio_Witkiewicz et al., 2015; 25855536), pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (Jiao et al., 2014; 24293293), cholangiocarcinoma (25%)(Churi et al., 2014; 25536104), appendiceal adenocarcinoma (14_20% mutation; 57% deletion)(Liu et al., 2014; 24821835, Maru et al., 2004; 14647445), colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC; 14%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696), esophageal adenocarcinoma (14%)(Wang et al., 2015; 26336083), and stomach adenocarcinoma (13%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317). In preclinical studies, SMAD4 loss of function has been implicated in the development of mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas, including mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN)(Izeradjene et al., 2007; 17349581) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN)(Bardeesy et al., 2006; 17114584); in clinical samples, SMAD4 homozygous deletion has been observed in 10% of IPMNs and 8% of MCNs, and mutation was also observed in 5% of IPMNs (Springer et al., 2015; 26253305). SMAD4 gene alterations have been associated with reduced overall survival for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Blackford et al., 2009; 19584151). Reduced SMAD4 expression has been associated with worse prognosis in various cancer types, including CRC (Yan et al., 2016; 26861460, Kozak et al., 2015; 25681512, Roth et al., 2012; 23104212), appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (Davison et al., 2014; 24618609), gastric adenocarcinoma (Kim et al., 2004; 15033661, Xiangming et al., 2001; 11234879), esophageal adenocarcinoma (Singhi et al., 2015; 25634752), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Natsugoe et al., 2002; 12060625), breast cancer (de Kruijf et al., 2013; 23022998), and prostate cancer (Shipitsin et al., 2014; 25032733). There are no therapies to address SMAD4 alterations in cancer. Preclinical studies (Cui et al., 2012; 22753594, Haeger et al., 2016; 25893305) and a clinical study of pancreatic cancer suggest that low SMAD4 expression exhibit increased responsiveness to chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin and irinotecan (Bachet et al., 2012; 22377565). One or more of the SMAD4 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with juvenile polyposis syndrome (ClinVar, Mar 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline SMAD4 mutations, including those at the R361 hotspot, have been observed in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome (Houlston et al., 1998; 9811934, Woodford_Richens et al., 2000; 10764709, Howe et al., 2004; 15235019, Howe et al., 2004; 15235019, Howe et al., 2004; 15235019), which is associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal cancers (Brosens et al., 2011; 22171123). The penetrance of deleterious SMAD4 mutations in patients with colon cancer is estimated at 20% by age 35 and 70% by age 65 (Kalia et al., 2017; 27854360).

TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Fabrizio et al., 2018; 30151257, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526). Elevated TMB has been reported in 8_25% of colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (George et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3587, Nagahashi et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e15103)(Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). Multiple studies have reported that the majority (up to 90%) of hypermutant CRC cases exhibit high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI_H) and mismatch repair deficiency (MMR_D) (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). Increased TMB is significantly associated with MSI_H and MMR_D, with studies reporting that 100% of MSI_H CRCs harbor elevated TMB and, conversely, that 100% of tumors with low TMB harbor intact MMR (George et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3587, Nagahashi et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e15103)(Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). A subset of CRCs that harbor increased TMB but not MSI_H are driven by mutations in POLE, which lead to an \u201cultramutated\u201d phenotype with especially high TMB (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). Tumors with increased TMB harbor BRAF V600E mutations more frequently than those with low TMB (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117), whereas TMB_low tumors more frequently harbor mutations in TP53 and APC (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696). In a study for 61 patients with metastatic, microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC treated with best standard of care, plasma TMB scores \u226528 muts/Mb (approximately 14 muts/Mb as measured by this assay) were associated with reduced OS as compared with plasma TMB scores <28 muts/Mb (3.0 vs. 5.3 months, HR 0.76, p=0.007), whereas tissue TMB was not found to be prognostic in this population (Chen et al., 2020; 32379280, Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, higher TMB has been reported to be associated with increased ORR and OS from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). Higher TMB was found to be significantly associated with improved OS upon immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment for patients with 9 types of advanced tumors (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254). Analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy, compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386). However, the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors found significant improvement in ORR for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (based on this assay or others) compared to those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb, in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types; similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). Together, these studies suggest that patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb may derive clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1 inhibitors. In CRC specifically, a retrospective analysis of immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy reported significantly improved OS for patients with tumors harboring TMB \u22659.8 Muts/MB compared with those with tumors with TMB <9.8 Muts/Mb (~ equivalency <12 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254). Another retrospective study reported that a TMB \u226512 Muts/Mb cutoff identifies >99% of MSI_High CRC cases but only 3% of MSS cases, indicating the utility of this cutoff for identification of patients with CRC likely to benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Fabrizio et al., 2018; 30151257).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null,
