Neurofibromin acts as a tumor suppressor by repressing RAS signaling (Morcos et al., 1996; 8628317). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt NF1 function or expression (Ballester et al., 1990; 2121371, Xu et al., 1990; 2116237, Martin et al., 1990; 2121370, Thomas et al., 2012; 22807134, Skuse and Cappione, 1997; 9300663, Morcos et al., 1996; 8628317, Messiaen et al., 1999; 11258625, Ars et al., 2000; 10607834, Messiaen and Wimmer, 2005; 15863657, Poullet et al., 1994; 8264648). NF1 mutation has been observed in 5_6% of lower grade gliomas and 9_14% of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cases; homozygous deletion of NF1 was observed in 1% of lower grade gliomas and 2_3% of GBMs (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751, cBio_Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890). NF1 loss was significantly associated with decreased overall and disease_specific survival in patients with lower grade gliomas (II_III), but not in those with GBM (Vizcaino et al., 2015; 26190195). On the basis of clinical evidence in neurofibromatosis Type 1_associated neurofibroma (Dombi et al., 2016; 28029918, Schalkwijk et al., 2021; 33903938, Glassberg et al., 2020; ASPHO Abstract 2015, Coyne et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 3612, McCowage et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 10504, Mueller et al., 2020; SNO Abstract NFB_17, Toledano et al., 2021; 33751171, Waldner et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1055/s_0040_1715638, Ronsley et al., 2021; 33939292), glioma or glioblastoma (Fangusaro et al., 2019; 31151904, Manoharan et al., 2020; 32780261, Kondyli et al., 2018; 30097824, Ronsley et al., 2021; 33939292, Romo et al., 2019; SNO Abstract RARE_54, Awada et al., 2020; 33082744), non_small cell lung cancer (Middleton et al., 2020; 32669708), NF1 inactivation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors such as cobimetinib, trametinib, binimetinib, and selumetinib. Loss or inactivation of NF1 may also predict sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors, including the approved agents everolimus and temsirolimus, based on limited clinical data (Lim et al., 2016; 26859683, Weiss et al., 2015; 25314964, Janku et al., 2014; 24931142) and strong preclinical data in models of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST)(Johannessen et al., 2008; 18164202, Johannessen et al., 2005; 15937108). A preclinical study suggests that combined mTOR and MEK inhibition is effective in a model of NF1_deficient MPNST (Malone et al., 2014; 24913553). Whereas frequent adverse events precluded a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for the combination of trametinib and everolimus in a Phase 1b trial for solid tumors (Tolcher et al., 2014; 25344362), a retrospective study for heavily pretreated patients with solid tumors reported tolerable regimens of the combination for 23/31 patients, with 16 patients treated >3 months and evaluable patients achieving a median PFS of 6.5 months (Patterson et al., 2018; AACR Abstract 3891). Germline mutations in NF1 cause the autosomal dominant disorder neurofibromatosis type 1, which is characterized in part by increased risk of developing various tumors, including sarcoma, glioma, breast carcinoma, and neuroendocrine and hematological neoplasms (Jett and Friedman, 2010; 20027112, Patil and Chamberlain, 2012; 22240541, Evans et al., 2012; 23036231). Estimates for the prevalence of the disorder in the general population range from 1:2,500 to 1:3,000 (Upadhyaya et al., 1995; 8544190, Williams et al., 2009; 19117870), and in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of NF1 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "On the basis of clinical evidence and strong preclinical evidence, NF1 inactivation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors.

The PI3K pathway is involved in cell signaling that regulates a number of critical cellular functions, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival (Samuels et al., 2005; 15950905, Engelman, 2009; 19629070). Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized, they have been associated with sensitivity to targeted therapies or have shown cancer association, which may indicate biological relevance (Tate et al., 2019; 30371878, Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2012; 22729224, Akgumus et al., 2017; 28502730, Slomovitz et al., 2015; 25624430, Al_Rohil et al., 2016; 26479420, Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). PIK3CA mutations have been reported in 5_23% of high_grade gliomas (including glioblastomas, anaplastic astrocytomas, and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas) (El_Habr et al., 2010; 20569675, Gallia et al., 2006; 17050665, Broderick et al., 2004; 15289301, Derakhshandeh_Peykar et al., 2011; 22026810, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890). While another study did not observe PIK3CA mutations in low_grade astrocytomas or in anaplastic astrocytomas, it did report high ERK and AKT activity (El_Habr et al., 2010; 20569675). One study found that PIK3CA mutation in glioblastoma (GBM) was associated with shorter median PFS in both a discovery cohort (6.9 vs. 12.4 months, HR=2.89, p=0.01) and in the TCGA cohort (6.1 vs. 9 months, p=0.008), but was not consistently associated with median OS (Tanaka et al., 2019; 31036078). In a study of IDH_wildtype GBM, patients with alterations in PI3K class I genes (PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PIK3CG, and PIK3R2) had significantly longer OS (20.0 months altered vs. 16.9 months wildtype, HR=0.62, p=0.002) and PFS (11.0 months altered vs. 7.4 months wildtype, p=0.0043); patients with PIK3CA alterations experienced an improved OS but this association was not highly significant (20.0 months altered vs. 18.1 months wildtype, p=0.0407)(Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Clinical and preclinical data in various tumor types indicate that PIK3CA activating alterations may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting PI3K (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574, Juric et al., 2018; 29401002, Gallant et al., 2019; 30793038), AKT (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Smyth et al., 2021; 33863913), or mTOR (Park et al., 2016; 27105424, Lim et al., 2016; 26859683, Hou et al., 2014; 25426553, Varnier et al., 2019; 31351267, Janku et al., 2014; 24440717, Moroney et al., 2012; 22927482, Basho et al., 2017; 27893038, Moroney et al., 2011; 21890452). Results from the Phase 2 MATCH trial for patients with PIK3CA_altered solid tumors found that 27% (18/65) of patients experienced PFS lasting at least 6 months after treatment with taselisib; however, no ORs were observed in this study (Krop et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 101). In a Phase 1 trial of the dual PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitor apitolisib, 79% (11/14) of patients with PIK3CA_mutated advanced solid tumors experienced disease control (3 PRs, 8 SDs) (Dolly et al., 2016; 26787751). The PI3K inhibitor alpelisib demonstrated an ORR of 6.0% (8/134) and a DCR of 58% (78/134) in a study of PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors (Juric et al., 2018; 2941002). However, the PI3K inhibitor copanlisib exhibited limited efficacy in PIK3CA_altered tumors (Santin et al., 2020; 31934607, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108). It is not known whether these therapeutic approaches would be relevant in the context of alterations that have not been fully characterized, as seen here. Activating mutations in PIK3CA may confer resistance to HER2_targeted therapies; combined inhibition of HER2 and the PI3K pathway may be required in HER2_positive tumors with PIK3CA mutation (Esteva et al., 2010; 20813970, Baselga et al., 2014; 25332247, Chakrabarty et al., 2010; 20581867, Cizkova et al., 2010; San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium Abstract P2_09_30, Kataoka et al., 2010; 19633047, Wang et al., 2011; 21676217).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PIK3CA activating mutations may lead to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may therefore indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.

A Phase 1/2 trial of temsirolimus in combination with sorafenib in glioblastoma was terminated at the Phase 2 interim analysis after patients failed to meet the primary endpoint of 6 month progression_free survival; significant toxicity was also observed in the combination therapy, even at low doses of temsirolimus (Lee et al., 2012; 23099651).

Studies in the literature have indicated that PTEN alterations (mutation or homozygous deletion) occur most frequently in glioblastoma (GBM), less frequently in anaplastic astrocytoma, and rarely in lower grade glioma subtypes including low grade astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, oligoastrocytoma, and ependymoma (Zhou et al., 1999; 10096247, Rasheed et al., 1997; 9331072, Davies et al., 1999; 10188904, Smith et al., 2001; 11504770, Lin et al., 1998; 9796977, Schmidt et al., 1999; 10560660, Kato et al., 2000; 11051241, Furnari et al., 2007; 17974913). One study detected PTEN mutation in 42% (97/232) and loss in 10% (24/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). In the TCGA dataset, PTEN mutation was observed in 23% of GBM cases and PTEN deletion was reported in 7% of cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142), while in the Lower Grade Glioma TCGA dataset, PTEN mutation was observed in 4% of cases and homozygous deletion observed in 1.2% of cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751). Loss of PTEN correlated with significantly worse prognosis in all grades of gliomas (Lin et al., 1998; 9796977, Srividya et al., 2011; 21134002). PTEN loss or mutation leads to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway (Courtney et al., 2010; 20085938, Simpson and Parsons, 2001; 11237521, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Milella et al., 2017; 28220839). Across various tissues, most clinical studies have not observed an association between PTEN deficiency and response to inhibitors of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway. However, limited studies in prostate cancer (Templeton et al., 2013; 23582881, Sweeney et al., 2021; 34246347, de Bono et al., 2019; 30037818, Saura et al., 2017; 27872130), renal cell carcinoma (Voss et al., 2019; 30327302), breast cancer (Andre et al., 2016; 27091708, Dent et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 1008, Schmid et al., 2020; 31841354), and colorectal cancer (Gilcrease et al., 2019; 30302599) have reported an association between PTEN deficiency and response to inhibitors targeting the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway. Preclinical data indicate that PTEN loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Mendes_Pereira et al., 2009; 20049735, Shen et al., 2013; 23881923, Chatterjee et al., 2013; 23565244, McCormick et al., 2016; 26905328, Forster et al., 2011; 21468130), and clinical benefit has been observed for patients with PTEN_altered breast cancer including triple negative breast cancer (Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006, Eikesdal et al., 2021; 33242536), ovarian cancer (Dougherty et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 5536), uterine leiomyosarcoma (Pan et al., 2021; 33970096), and endometrial cancer (Forster et al., 2011; 21468130) treated with PARP inhibitors. However, some studies have reported a lack of association between PTEN mutation and PARP inhibitor sensitivity (Sandhu et al., 2013; 23810788, Romero et al., 2020; 32988624, Piha_Paul et al., 2018; AACR Abstract A096). Limited clinical evidence in glioblastoma (Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Peiwen et al., 2019; AACR Abstract A060), leiomyosarcoma (George et al., 2017; 28228279), and melanoma (Peng et al., 2016; 26645196) suggests that PTEN alterations may predict a lack of response to anti_PD_1 therapy. In an analysis of 39 patients with metastatic melanoma treated with pembrolizumab or nivolumab, patients with PTEN_expressing tumors achieved significantly greater reduction of tumor size than those with reduction or loss of PTEN expression (Peng et al., 2016; 26645196). In a retrospective analysis of 66 patients with glioblastoma, tumors from nivolumab or pembrolizumab non_responders were significantly enriched for PTEN mutations (Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Peiwen et al., 2019; AACR Abstract A060). In a patient with uterine leiomyosarcoma treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy, a treatment_resistant tumor arose that harbored PTEN loss (George et al., 2017; 28228279). PTEN mutations underlie several inherited disorders, collectively termed PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS), which include Cowden syndrome (CS) and its variant Lhermitte_Duclos disease (LD), Bannayan_Riley_Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), PTEN_related Proteus syndrome (PS), and Proteus_like syndrome (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191, Orloff and Eng, 2008; 18794875). The mutation rate for PTEN in these disorders ranges from 20 to 85% of patients (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191, Zbuk and Eng, 2007; 17167516). The estimated incidence of Cowden syndrome is 1/200,000, which may be an underestimate due to the high variability of this disorder (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI_High has been reported in 3_8% of adult or pediatric astrocytomas and was generally not associated with Lynch syndrome (Alonso et al., 2001; 11280776, Rodr\u00edguez_Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2013; 24073290, Vladimirova et al., 2008; 18053027). Low_level MSI has been reported in 5_9% of glioblastoma (GBM) samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927, Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285, Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). A large_scale study did not find high_level microsatellite instability (MSI_H) in any of 129 GBM samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), although a small_scale study reported MSI_H in 4 of 15 pediatric GBMs and 1 of 12 adult GBMs (Szybka et al., 2003; 12908754). The frequency of MSI has been reported to be increased in relapsed compared to primary GBM (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), in GBMs with a previous lower grade astrocytoma (Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285), and in giant cell GBM compared to classic GBM (Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "SETD2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "rearrangement intron 5", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "rearrangement intron 5"}}, "Interpretation": "SETD2 encodes a histone lysine_36 methyltransferase (Sun et al., 2005; 16118227) that preferentially interacts with the expanded N_terminal polyglutamine tracts present in mutant huntingtin, implicating it in the pathogenesis of Huntington disease (Faber et al., 1998; 9700202). SETD2 mRNA expression has been observed to be consistently reduced in breast tumors relative to adjacent non_tumor tissue, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role (Al Sarakbi et al., 2009; 19698110). SETD2 alterations such as observed here have been shown to be inactivating (Parker et al., 2016; 27282254, Zhang et al., 2012; 22237106, McKinney et al., 2017; 28122867, Moffitt et al., 2017; 28424246, Zhu et al., 2014; 24509477, Lu et al., 2016; 27174990). Somatic inactivating alterations of SETD2 are documented to occur at low frequency in a number of solid tumors, most commonly in renal carcinoma (Varela et al., 2011; 21248752).

Mutations within the promoter region of TERT that confer enhanced TERT promoter activity have been reported in two hotspots, located at _124 bp and _146 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (also termed C228T and C250T, respectively)(Horn et al., 2013; 23348503, Huang et al., 2014; 23348506, Vinagre et al., 2013; 23887589), as well as tandem mutations at positions \u2013124/\u2013125 bp and \u2013138/\u2013139 bp (Horn et al., 2013; 23348503). TERT promoter mutations have been reported in 51_59% of gliomas (Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Killela et al., 2014; 24722048), most frequently in glioblastoma (GBM, 54_84%), gliosarcoma (81%), oligodendroglioma (78%), and historically in oligoastrocytomas (25_31%) but less frequently in lower grade astrocytomas (10_18%) and in only 1% of ependymomas (Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Liu et al., 2013; 23603989, Koelsche et al., 2013; 24154961, Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Killela et al., 2014; 24722048). The significance of the TERT promoter mutation as an independent prognostic indicator in patients with glioma is not clear. While TERT promoter mutations significantly associate with poor prognosis in patients with GBM, this correlation may be due to the association with primary GBM as opposed to IDH_positive secondary GBM (Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Reitman et al., 2013; 24217890, Arita et al., 2013; 23764841). In the context of IDH_wildtype glioma, TERT mutations are associated with reduced OS, whereas in IDH_mutated, 1p/19q co_deleted oligodendroglioma, TERT mutations are associated with improved OS (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v5.2020). TERT promoter mutation has been shown to be significantly associated with increased TERT gene expression in astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and GBM (Arita et al., 2013; 23764841). Therapeutic options for targeting tumors with TERT mutations are limited, although a variety of approaches are under development, including immunotherapies utilizing TERT as a tumor_associated antigen, antisense oligonucleotide_ or peptide_based therapies, and TERT promoter_directed cytotoxic molecules.

For pediatric patients, high TMB has been reported in a subset of high_grade gliomas, frequently in association with mutations in mismatch repair or proofreading genes and in TP53, whereas BRAF alterations or other oncogene fusions were observed more frequently in brain tumors harboring low TMB (Patel et al., 2020; 32386112, Johnson et al., 2017; 28912153). Increased TMB has been reported to correlate with higher tumor grade in glioma (Draaisma et al., 2015; 26699864) and glioblastoma (GBM) tissue samples with biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD) (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570), as well as with shorter OS of patients with diffuse glioma (Wang et al., 2020; 32164609). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In glioma, a lack of association between TMB and clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors has been reported (Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Touat et al., 2020; 32322066). However, multiple case studies have reported that patients with ultramutated gliomas driven by POLE mutations have benefited from treatment with anti_PD_1 (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556) or anti_PD_L1 (Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642) therapies. Therefore, although increased TMB alone may not be a strong biomarker for PD_1 or PD_L1 inhibitors in this cancer type, these agents may have efficacy for patients with glioma harboring both high TMB and POLE mutation.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "NF1", "Alteration": "loss exons 2_58", "Title": "Efficacy and Safety of Targeted Precision Therapy in Refractory Tumor With Druggable Molecular Event", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB4, PARP, mTOR, MET, RET, ROS1, VEGFRs, BRAF, CDK4, CDK6", "Locations": "Shanghai (China)", "NCTID": "NCT03239015", "Note": "On the basis of clinical evidence and strong preclinical evidence, NF1 inactivation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors.
