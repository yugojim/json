APC interacts with beta_catenin and controls signaling in the WNT pathway, which regulates embryonic development and cell differentiation (Logan and Nusse, 2004; 15473860). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt APC function or expression (Eklof et al., 2001; 11707392, Liu et al., 2006; 16753179, Dikovskaya et al., 2010; 20144988, Murphy et al., 2007; 17410430, Aretz et al., 2004; 15459959). APC mutations have been found in 73% of tumors in the colorectal adenocarcinoma TCGA dataset (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696). In 1 study, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of APC was observed in 32% of colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (Christie et al., 2013; 23085758). The prognostic significance of APC mutations in sporadic CRC remains unclear (Quyn et al., 2008; 19110823). Solid tumors with WNT/beta_catenin pathway alterations, as seen here, were observed to have significantly less T_cell inflammation in one study (Luke et al., 2019; 30635339). There are no approved drugs targeting APC inactivation in cancer. Loss of APC function leads to accumulation of beta_catenin and upregulation of WNT pathway transcription programs (Zhan et al., 2017; 27617575), and potential therapeutic approaches to target this pathway include CBP/beta_catenin antagonists, which interfere with the ability of beta_catenin to interact with transcriptional co_activator CBP (Jung et al., 2020; 32037398, Krishnamurthy and Kurzrock, 2018; 29169144). In a Phase 1 trial of the CBP/beta_catenin antagonist E7386, 1 patient with APC_mutated small bowel adenocarcinoma achieved a PR with tumor shrinkage of _69% and response duration of 165 days (Kawazoe et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 473P); preclinical data support sensitivity of APC_deficient gastric or colorectal cancer models to E7386 (Yamada et al., 2021; 33408116, Kanda et al., 2022; 34837838). One or more of the APC variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (ClinVar, Sep 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in APC are found in more than 90% of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) (Kerr et al., 2013; 23159591, Fearon, 2011; 21090969, Kastritis et al., 2009; 18844223). The prevalence for FAP in the general population is estimated to be 1:8,300 from birth (Half et al., 2009; 19822006), and in the appropriate clinical context germline testing of APC is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Based on preclinical and limited clinical data, APC inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to CBP/beta_catenin interaction inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT05091346", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04008797", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03264664", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "FBXW7", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "S86*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "S86*"}}, "Interpretation": "FBXW7 encodes the F_box protein subunit of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets proteins for degradation (Welcker and Clurman, 2008; 18094723). FBXW7 inactivation is associated with chromosomal instability and with stabilization of proto_oncogenes, such as mTOR, MYC, cyclin E, NOTCH, and JUN; FBXW7 is therefore considered a tumor suppressor (Akhoondi et al., 2007; 17909001, Welcker and Clurman, 2008; 18094723). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt FBXW7 function or expression (Welcker et al., 2013; 24298052, Welcker et al., 2007; 17298674, Strohmaier et al., 2001; 11565034, Pashkova et al., 2010; 21070969, Akhoondi et al., 2007; 17909001, O Neil et al., 2007; 17646409, Malyukova et al., 2013; 23228967, Thompson et al., 2007; 17646408). Mutations in FBXW7 have been identified in up to 12% of colorectal adenocarcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, cBio_Brannon et al., 2014; 25164765, cBio_Vasaikar et al., 2019; 31031003) and also in 4_7% of colorectal adenomas (Rajagopalan et al., 2004; 14999283, Miyaki et al., 2009; 19420964). Low FBXW7 mRNA levels are associated with poor patient prognosis, and FBXW7 inactivation in colorectal cancer has been associated with chromosomal instability (Rajagopalan et al., 2004; 14999283, Iwatsuki et al., 2010; 19739118). FBXW7 inactivating alterations may indicate sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors (Mao et al., 2008; 18787170, Yang et al., 2015; 25749036). Case series reported objective responses for 2 patients with FBXW7_mutated cervical squamous cell carcinoma treated with everolimus (Kulkarni et al., 2020; SGO Abstract 356). Multiple clinical studies report that inhibitors of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway have not produced significant clinical benefit as monotherapies to treat CRC, even for tumors that harbor alterations in PIK3CA or PTEN; data are more limited for alterations in other genes in this pathway (Ng et al., 2013; 23743569, Ganesan et al., 2013; 24092809, Janku et al., 2014; 24440717).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Loss or inactivation of FBXW7 may lead to increased mTOR activation and may predict sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors.

Mutations in KRAS have been reported in approximately 35_50% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) (Lievre et al., 2006; 16618717, De Roock et al., 2011; 21163703, Chen et al., 2014; 25367198, Li et al., 2015; 25929517, Hu et al., 2016; 27977612, Zekri et al., 2017; 28218784, Staudacher et al., 2017; 29048416, Wang et al., 2018; 29705968, Guo et al., 2018; 29666387). Numerous studies have reported that KRAS mutations are associated with increased metastasis, adverse clinicopathological features, and shorter survival of patients with CRC (Chen et al., 2014; 25367198, Li et al., 2015; 25929517, Hu et al., 2016; 27977612, M\u00e1rmol et al., 2017; 28106826, Zekri et al., 2017; 28218784, Kwak et al., 2017; 28858102). Preclinical evidence suggests that KRAS activation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, such as trametinib, binimetinib, cobimetinib, and selumetinib (Nakano et al., 1984; 6320174, Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Yamaguchi et al., 2011; 21523318, Watanabe et al., 2013; 23438367, Gilmartin et al., 2011; 21245089, Yeh et al., 2009; 19372556). However, multiple clinical trials have reported lack of efficacy of trametinib and other MEK inhibitors when used as monotherapy for treatment of patients with KRAS_mutant CRC (Tsimberidou et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract e22086)(Infante et al., 2012; 22805291, Zimmer et al., 2014; 24947927, Bennouna et al., 2011; 20127139, Weekes et al., 2013; 23434733). Both clinical (Hochster et al., 2013; ASCO GI Abstract 380, Juric et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 9051) and preclinical (Lamba et al., 2014; 25199829, Sun et al, 2014; 24685132) studies suggest that combinatorial approaches including MEK inhibitors are likely to be more effective for the treatment of CRC, including strategies such as combination of MEK inhibitors with PI3K inhibitors (Juric et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 9051), RAF inhibitors (Lamba et al., 2014; 25199829), pan_ERBB inhibitors (Sun et al, 2014; 24685132), or chemotherapeutic agents (Hochster et al., 2013; ASCO GI Abstract 380). In a Phase 1 study evaluating the MEK_pan_RAF dual inhibitor CH5126766, 6 patients harboring KRAS mutations experienced PRs, including 3 with non_small cell lung cancer (NCSLC), 1 with low_grade serous ovarian carcinoma (LGSOC), 1 with endometrial adenocarcinoma, and 1 with multiple myeloma (Guo et al., 2020; 33128873). Combination of CH5126766 with the FAK inhibitor defactinib elicited PR rates of 50% (4/8) for patients with KRAS_mutated low_grade serous ovarian cancer and 12% (2/17) for patients with KRAS_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a Phase 1 study (Krebs et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT019, Shinde et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT143). Preclinical and clinical data suggest that KRAS mutations may predict clinical benefit from SHP2 inhibitors (Lu et al., 2019; 31068384, Mainardi et al., 2018; 29808006, Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001, Brana et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3005, Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). A Phase 1 study of RMC_4630 for relapsed/refractory solid tumors reported a DCR of 58% (23/40) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS mutations and a DCR of 75% (12/16) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS G12C mutations (Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001). Interim results from a Phase 1/2 study of RMC_4630 plus cobimetinib reported tumor reduction in 3 of 8 patients with KRAS_mutated colorectal cancer (Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). Preclinical data suggest that KRAS mutation may confer sensitivity to SOS1 inhibitors (Hillig et al., 2019; 30683722, Hofmann et al., 2021; 32816843, Gerlach et al., 2020; AACR Abstract 1091). Phase 1 studies of the SOS1 inhibitor BI 1701963 alone or in combination with MEK inhibitors, KRAS G12C inhibitors, or irinotecan are recruiting for patients with solid tumors harboring KRAS mutations (Hofmann et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT210, Gort et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract TPS3651). Preclinical and limited clinical evidence suggest that KRAS mutation may predict sensitivity to PLK1 inhibitors (Luo et al., 2009; 19490893, Lenz et al., 2020; ASCO GI Abstract TPS265). A Phase 1b/2 study of PLK1 inhibitor onvansertib in combination with FOLFIRI and bevacizumab for patients with KRAS_mutated metastatic CRC previously treated with chemotherapy reported an 87.5% (7/8; 3 PR, 4 SD) clinical benefit rate, with 1 patient going on to successful curative surgery (Barzi et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT235). Activating mutations in KRAS or NRAS are associated with lack of clinical benefit from cetuximab (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Bokemeyer et al., 2011; 21228335, Karapetis et al., 2008; 18946061, De Roock et al., 2008; 17998284) or panitumumab (Douillard et al., 2014; 24718886, Douillard et al., 2012; 24024839, Amado et al., 2008; 18316791) for patients with CRC.

The Phase 3 study STRATEGIC_1 reported a similar duration of disease control (DDC) for patients with unresectable metastatic CRC (mCRC) and KRAS_, NRAS_, and BRAF_wildtype status treated with mFOLFOX_bevacizumab alternated with a cetuximab regimen in first or second line, respectively (overall DDC 22.5 vs. 23.5 months); in addition, the study reported similar OS (37.8 vs. 34.4 months) and higher numerical ORR for patients treated with cetuximab in the first line followed by mFOLFOX_bevacizumab compared with those receiving EGFR_directed antibodies in the second or third line (Chibaudel et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 3504). A prospective study of cetuximab monotherapy for patients with KRAS_, NRAS_, and BRAF_wildtype mCRC reported 11% (2/19) PRs and 58% (11/19) SDs (Moiseyenko et al., 2018; 29470838). The Phase 2 AVETUX trial of cetuximab combined with avelumab and mFOLFOX6 for patients with RAS_ and BRAF_wildtype mCRC resulted in an ORR of 81% (4 CR and 27 PRs, n=37) and a DCR of 89% (Stein et al., 2021; 34315821). In the Phase 3 ASPECCT study, panitumumab was found to be non_inferior to cetuximab with respect to median OS (10.4 vs. 10.0 months, HR=0.97) for patients with previously treated KRAS exon 2 wildtype metastatic colorectal cancer; median PFS was also similar between the two treatment groups (4.4 vs. 4.1 months, HR=1.00)(Price et al., 2014; 24739896). In a similar patient population, a Phase 2 study of combination panitumumab and irinotecan versus combination cetuximab and irinotecan also demonstrated non_inferiority with respect to median PFS (5.4 vs. 4.3 months, HR = 0.64) and median OS (14.9 vs. 11.5 months, HR=0.66)(Sakai et al., 2020; 32526634). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Resistant", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04803318", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03284502", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04303403", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04870034", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03905148", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04551521", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04720976", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04965818", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03829410", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Blood Tumor Mutational Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "05", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "05"}}, "Interpretation": "Blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations from circulating tumor DNA in blood. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). High bTMB levels were not detected in this sample. It is unclear whether the bTMB levels in this sample would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Depending on the clinical context, TMB testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. In 1 study, the median plasma TMB for 163 patients with metastatic CRC was 16.3 muts/Mb (approximately 8 muts/Mb as measured by this assay) (Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61). The prognostic value of tumor mutational burden (TMB) in colorectal cancer (CRC) is context_ and therapy_dependent. A study of tissue TMB (tTMB) in 145 CRC samples showed longer OS in TMB_high samples compared with TMB_low ones (Schwartz et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 572). Similarly, for patients with metastatic CRC treated with first_line chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab or cetuximab, high tissue TMB (tTMB_H) was associated with longer OS (Innocenti et al., 2019; 30865548). For patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, tTMB_H was associated with better 5_year relapse_free survival (Lee et al., 2019; 31285374). However, for patients with EGFR/BRAF_inhibitor_treated, BRAF_mutated microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic CRC, intermediate tTMB was associated with significantly poorer PFS and OS compared with TMB_low status; patients with primary resistance to EGFR/BRAF blockage had higher TMB than those sensitive to these therapies (Randon et al., 2022; 34933155). In a study for 61 patients with metastatic, MSS CRC treated with best standard of care, plasma TMB scores \u226528 Muts/Mb (approximately 14 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) were associated with reduced OS compared with plasma TMB scores <28 Muts/Mb (3.0 vs. 5.3 months, HR=0.76, p=0.007), whereas tTMB was not found to be prognostic in this population (Chen et al., 2020; 32379280, Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB) may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716), anti_PD_1 (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716), and anti_PD_1/CTLA4 therapies (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P). A Phase 2 multi_solid_tumor trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022). In non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single_agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 Muts/Mb_16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "DNMT3A", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "R882C", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "R882C"}}, "Interpretation": "The DNMT3A gene encodes the protein DNA methyltransferase 3A, an enzyme that is involved in the methylation of newly synthesized DNA, a function critical for gene regulation (Trowbridge and Orkin, 2012; 22200773, Ch\u00e9din, 2011; 21507354). The role of DNMT3A in cancer is uncertain, as some reports describe increased expression and contribution to tumor growth, whereas others propose a role for DNMT3A as a tumor suppressor (Yang et al., 2011; 21887466, Vallb\u00f6hmer et al., 2006; 16870044, Daskalos et al., 2011; 21351083, Fabbri et al., 2007; 17890317, Gao et al., 2011; 22011581, Kim et al., 2013; 23031157). Mutations at codon 882, including R882S, R882H, and R882C, have demonstrated reduced methyltransferase activity in vitro, with R882H and R882C conferring increased cell proliferation (Yan et al., 2011; 21399634, Holz_Schietinger et al., 2012; 22722925, Metzeler et al., 2012; 22124213). About half of all DNMT3A mutations in AML are R882H, which leads to a partially defective enzyme and altered oligomerization behavior, although the effect on global methylation remains to some extent controversial; in addition, at least one report suggests that mutation of R882 is associated with sensitivity to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (reviewed in Abdel_Wahab and Levine, 2013; 23640996, Yan et al., 2011; 21399634, Metzeler et al., 2012; 22124213, Holz_Schietinger et al., 2012; 22722925). On the basis of this, any alteration at R882 is likely to promote tumorigenesis, although the efficacy of DNMT inhibitors may not be consistent for all mutations. DNMT3A alterations have been reported at relatively low frequencies in solid tumors and are more prevalent in hematological malignancies (cBioPortal, Feb 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of DNMT3A alterations in solid tumors are limited (PubMed, Feb 2022). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in DNMT3A in solid tumors. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "IKZF1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "R450H", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "R450H"}}, "Interpretation": "IKZF1 encodes the Ikaros family zinc finger protein 1, a transcription factor and chromatin remodeling protein that is considered to be a tumor suppressor (Olsson and Johansson, 2015; 25753742, Payne and Dovat, 2011; 22150303). IKZF1 alterations that result in disruption or loss of the zinc_finger motifs (amino acids 117_514) are predicted to lead to a loss of Ikaros function (Payne and Dovat, 2011; 22150303, Li et al., 2011; 21765980, Cobb et al., 2000; 10970879). IKZF1 alterations occur at a relatively low frequency in various solid tumor types, including cutaneous melanoma (up to 7%)(cBio_Hodis et al., 2012; 22817889, cBio_Krauthammer et al., 2012; 22842228), lung adenocarcinoma (up to 7%) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, cBio_Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975), uterine endometrioid carcinoma (5%) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2013; 23636398), stomach adenocarcinoma (4%) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317, cBio_Wang et al., 2014; 24816253), colorectal adenocarcinoma (2_3%) (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, cBio_Seshagiri et al., 2012; 22895193), and small cell lung cancer (up to 3%) (cBio_George et al., 2015; 26168399, cBio_Rudin et al., 2012; 22941189), but the functional and prognostic impact of IKZF1 alterations in solid tumors has not been established (Zhang et al., 2013; 23580163, Yang et al., 2010; 20596648, He et al., 2012; 22859015, Javierre et al., 2011; 21737484). IKZF1 alterations have been predominantly studied in the context of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and have been found in 15% of pediatric B_cell ALL cases and more than 70% of BCR_ABL1_positive ALL cases (Mullighan, 2012; 23233609, Tefferi, 2010; 20428194, Mullighan et al., 2007; 17344859). IKZF1 deletions have been associated with poor outcomes in ALL, including reduced overall survival and increased risk of recurrence (D\u00f6rge et al., 2012; 22875627, Krentz et al., 2012; 22699455, Collins_Underwood and Mullighan, 2010; 20739952, Hunger et al., 2011; 21370430). There are no therapeutic options to directly target IKZF1 alterations. Preclinical studies have reported that the immunomodulatory therapy lenalidomide, which is approved in certain hematological malignancies, causes degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos (encoded by IKZF3); degradation of these transcription factors has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for the activity of lenalidomide (Kr\u00f6nke et al., 2014; 24292625, Lu et al., 2014; 24292623, Kr\u00f6nke et al., 2015; 26131937).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. Approximately 10_15% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) are MSI_high (MSI_H), 8_16% are MSI_low (MSI_L), and the remaining majority are microsatellite_stable (MSS) (Jass et al., 1999; 10562815, Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894). Multiple studies have shown that MSI_H CRCs have a better prognosis than MSI_low (MSI_L) or microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors (Samowitz et al., 2001; 11535541, Elsaleh and Iacopetta, 2001; 12445368, Brueckl et al., 2003; 12820457, Guidoboni et al., 2001; 11438476, Gryfe et al., 2000; 10631274, Sinicrope et al., 2006; 16952542, Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Laghi and Malesci, 2012; 22722556). MSI_H CRCs are associated with certain pathologic and molecular features, including poor differentiation, right_sided and mucinous tumors, increased numbers of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, diploidy, and a relatively high frequency of BRAF mutations (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). The prognostic implications of MS_Equivocal status for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) have not been evaluated in published studies. One study reported that microsatellite instability_low (MSI_L) tumors occur more frequently in early_stage CRC than advanced CRC (Kambara et al., 2001; 11691787); in contrast, another study found that MSI_L status is associated with advanced stage and worse OS for patients with CRC (Esfahani et al., 2019; 30549036). MSI_L CRCs resemble MS_Stable tumors in most clinicopathologic features (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947) but harbor a significantly higher frequency of KRAS mutations than MS_Stable tumors (Jass et al., 1999; 10562815, Kambara et al., 2001; 11691787, Konishi et al., 1996; 8690195). MSS colorectal cancers are molecularly heterogeneous, driven by diverse mechanisms such as extensive DNA methylation, oncogenic mutations in KRAS or BRAF, or chromosomal instability (Jass, 2007; 17204026). On the basis of prospective clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD_1_targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Shitara et al., 2022; 35322232, Andre et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 244, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143), as well as PD_L1_targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92). Pembrolizumab therapy resulted in a significantly higher ORR in MSI_H CRC compared with MSS CRC (40% vs. 0%)(Le et al., 2015; 26028255). Similarly, a clinical study of nivolumab, alone or in combination with ipilimumab, in patients with CRC reported a significantly higher response rate in patients with tumors with high MSI than those without (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635). An earlier case study reported that nivolumab therapy resulted in a complete response in a patient with MSI_H CRC (Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436). A Phase 1b trial of atezolizumab combined with bevacizumab reported PRs for 40% (4/10) of patients with MSI_H CRC (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673). As the MSI status of this tumor is unknown, the relevance of these therapeutic approaches is unclear. MSI has not been found to be a predictive biomarker for combination chemotherapy regimens, including FOLFOX (Sinicrope et al., 2013; 24019539, Gavin et al., 2012; 23045248) and FOLFIRI (Bertagnolli et al., 2009; 19273709, Van Cutsem et al., 2009; 19451425). Patients with MSS CRC are more likely to benefit from postsurgical fluorouracil (FU)_based adjuvant therapy (Ribic et al., 2003; 12867608, Sargent et al., 2010; 20498393) but less likely to benefit from irinotecan chemotherapy (Fallik et al., 2003; 14522894).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "PTPRO", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "V230I", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "V230I"}}, "Interpretation": "PTPRO, also known as GLEPP1 , encodes a protein tyrosine phosphatase that regulates podocyte function (Wiggins et al., 1994; 7665166, Wharram et al., 2000; 11086029). In the context of cancer, PTPRO is a tumor suppressor that attenuates signaling and tumorigenesis by multiple oncogenes, through dephosphorylation and/or endocytic downregulation of these substrates (Motiwala et al., 2004; 15356345, Yu et al., 2012; 22851698, Hou et al., 2013; 22821478, Dong et al., 2017; 27345410). In the TCGA datasets, PTPRO mutation has been reported at highest frequency in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC, 6.2%)(cBio_Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745), uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC, 5.4%) (cBio_Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2013; 23636398), and lung adenocarcinoma (3%) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552), whereas homozygous deletion was most frequently identified in cases of lung (3%) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552) or prostate (1.8%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26544944) adenocarcinoma. Hypermethylation of the PTPRO promoter is also observed in breast (Li et al., 2014; 24919593, Dong et al., 2017; 27345410, Ramaswamy et al., 2009; 19095770), hepatocellular (Hsu et al., 2013; 23533167, Motiwala et al., 2003; 14508512), colorectal (Mori et al., 2004; 15059896), esophageal squamous cell (You et al., 2012; 22099875), and lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (Ming et al., 2017; 28586036) as well as in some leukemias (Motiwala et al., 2007; 17545520, Stevenson et al., 2014; 24045499). Promoter methylation significantly correlates with reduced PTPRO transcript levels (Hsu et al., 2013; 23533167, Yu et al., 2012; 22851698, Motiwala et al., 2004; 15356345, Li et al., 2014; 24919593, Dong et al., 2017; 27345410) and is associated with poor prognosis in patients with lung SCC (Ming et al., 2017; 28586036) and breast cancer (Li et al., 2014; 24919593, Huang et al., 2013; 24090193, Yu et al., 2012; 22851698); in the context of the latter, epigenetic silencing of PTPRO is an independent predictor of shorter overall survival (OS) for patients with HER2_positive disease (Li et al., 2014; 24919593, Huang et al., 2013; 24090193). Low PTPRO expression in breast cancer is also significantly associated with shorter OS and poor prognosis (Yu et al., 2012; 22851698) and in lung SCC is an independent predictor of the latter (Ming et al., 2017; 28586036). No targeted therapies are available to address genomic alterations in PTPRO. In a preclinical study of breast cancer, PTPRO expression was suppressed by estrogen but increased by tamoxifen; upregulation of PTPRO sensitized cells to this selective estrogen modulator (Ramaswamy et al., 2009; 19095770). Low PTPRO expression has been implicated in resistance to cetuximab in patients with KRAS wild_type colorectal carcinoma (Asbagh et al., 2014; 25301722).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "RAD21", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "true", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "RAD21 encodes a protein involved in DNA double_strand break repair and sister chromatid cohesion as a part of the cohesin complex (Xu et al., 2011; 21326324, Hill et al., 2016; 27207471, Solomon et al., 2014; 24856830, Bauerschmidt et al., 2010; 19906707). In preclinical studies, downregulation of RAD21 or other cohesin components leads to loss of expression from amplified genes, as well as amplifications themselves upon cell passaging (Yun et al., 2016; 26420833), but also leads to an increase in deletions, insertions, and other rearrangements (Gelot et al., 2016; 27326661). High RAD21 expression has also been associated with increased genomic instability (Yan et al., 2012; 22537934). Cohesin complex also organizes chromatin domains and regulates gene expression (Sofueva et al., 2013; 24185899, Deng et al., 2012; 23010778). Both overexpression and reduction of expression of RAD21 has been reported to alter gene expression (Yun et al., 2016; 27466323). RAD21 amplification has been correlated with increased expression in breast (Yan et al., 2012; 22537934, Xu et al., 2011; 21255398, Mahmood et al., 2014; 24148822) and endometrial (Supernat et al., 2012; 23205091) cancers. Other RAD21 alterations, including truncating and point mutations, have been reported in the context of cancer, but the majority have not been characterized. RAD21 amplifications have been reported in solid tumors, including breast cancers (7%), melanoma (5.4%), and prostate (2.4%) cancers (cBio_Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359). RAD21 overexpression has been correlated with poor prognosis in endometrial cancer (Supernat et al., 2012; 23205091), breast cancer (Xu et al., 2011; 21255398, Sharaf et al., 2022; 35227290), Ewing sarcoma (Su et al., 2021; 33766983), and colorectal cancer (CRC), especially in KRAS_mutant CRC (Deb et al., 2014; 24548858).

Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 mutations have been reported in up to 75% of colorectal cancer cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Goh et al., 1995; 7585578, Berg et al., 2010; 21103049, Han et al., 2013; 23700467, Peeters et al., 2013; 23325582, Malhotra et al., 2013; 23526092, Di Bartolomeo et al., 2013; 23821376, Fong et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 57). A study reported p53 expression in 49% of analyzed colorectal cancer cases (Wangefjord et al., 2013; 23337059). TP53 mutation has not been consistently demonstrated to be a significant independent prognostic marker in the context of CRC (Russo et al., 2005; 16172461, Fong et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 57). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Fraction", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor fraction provides an estimate of the percentage of ctDNA present in a cell_free DNA (cfDNA) sample. The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with elevated tumor fraction have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus high sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at low risk of false negative results. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels.
