APC interacts with beta_catenin and controls signaling in the WNT pathway, which regulates embryonic development and cell differentiation (Logan and Nusse, 2004; 15473860). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt APC function or expression (Eklof et al., 2001; 11707392, Liu et al., 2006; 16753179, Dikovskaya et al., 2010; 20144988, Murphy et al., 2007; 17410430, Aretz et al., 2004; 15459959). APC mutations have been found in 73% of tumors in the colorectal adenocarcinoma TCGA dataset (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696). In 1 study, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of APC was observed in 32% of colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (Christie et al., 2013; 23085758). The prognostic significance of APC mutations in sporadic CRC remains unclear (Quyn et al., 2008; 19110823). Solid tumors with WNT/beta_catenin pathway alterations, as seen here, were observed to have significantly less T_cell inflammation in one study (Luke et al., 2019; 30635339). There are no approved drugs targeting APC inactivation in cancer. Loss of APC function leads to accumulation of beta_catenin and upregulation of WNT pathway transcription programs (Zhan et al., 2017; 27617575), and potential therapeutic approaches to target this pathway include CBP/beta_catenin antagonists, which interfere with the ability of beta_catenin to interact with transcriptional co_activator CBP (Jung et al., 2020; 32037398, Krishnamurthy and Kurzrock, 2018; 29169144). In a Phase 1 trial of the CBP/beta_catenin antagonist E7386, 1 patient with APC_mutated small bowel adenocarcinoma achieved a PR with tumor shrinkage of _69% and response duration of 165 days (Kawazoe et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 473P); preclinical data support sensitivity of APC_deficient gastric or colorectal cancer models to E7386 (Yamada et al., 2021; 33408116, Kanda et al., 2022; 34837838). Germline mutations in APC are found in more than 90% of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) (Kerr et al., 2013; 23159591, Fearon, 2011; 21090969, Kastritis et al., 2009; 18844223). The prevalence for FAP in the general population is estimated to be 1:8,300 from birth (Half et al., 2009; 19822006), and in the appropriate clinical context germline testing of APC is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Based on preclinical and limited clinical data, APC inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to CBP/beta_catenin interaction inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT05091346", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04008797", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03264664", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "KIT", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "W557C", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "37.45", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "W557C"}}, "Interpretation": "KIT (also called c_KIT) encodes a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor that, upon ligand binding and dimerization, activates the PI3K_AKT and RAS_MAPK signaling pathways (Linnekin, 1999; 10582339). KIT aberrations, including point mutations, translocations, amplification, and overexpression, have been associated with various malignancies, and KIT is considered an oncoprotein (Fletcher, 2004; 15175998). This KIT alteration occurs within the autoinhibitory juxtamembrane domain (Y544_H579) of the c_KIT protein, a hotspot region for mutations (exon 11); such mutations are expected to disrupt an autoinhibitory mechanism of KIT, resulting in gain_of_function activation (Tarn et al., 2005; 15897563, Hirota et al., 1998; 9438854, Chan et al., 2003; 12697809, Allander et al., 2001; 11751374, Rubin et al., 2001; 11719439, Martin et al., 2005; 16135486). Furthermore, mutation at the W557 position, specifically W557G (Conca et al., 2013; 23567324), has been characterized as activating. KIT W557R was found in the germline of a family with autosomal dominant predisposition to GIST (Robson et al., 2004; 14977822). Patients with GIST with the W557G or W557S mutations were reported to respond to imatinib (Heinrich et al., 2006; 16954519, Miselli et al., 2007; 17438095), and a patient with the W557G mutation responded to sunitinib (Minor et al., 2012; 22261812). Therefore, any mutation at the W557 position is likely activating. KIT mutation has been reported in 3_6% of colorectal carcinomas analyzed (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, cBio_Seshagiri et al., 2012; 22895193). KIT protein expression has been reported in 17_59% of colorectal carcinomas (Medinger et al., 2010; 20177846, El_Serafi et al., 2010; 20652953). The prognostic significance of KIT expression in colorectal cancer is unclear, with some studies reporting an association with or a trend toward reduced disease_free survival, and another study finding a trend toward better overall survival in patients with KIT_positive colorectal cancer (El_Serafi et al., 2010; 20652953, Medinger et al., 2010; 20177846, Friederichs et al., 2010; 19280218). On the basis of clinical evidence, primarily in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), melanoma, AML, and systemic mastocytosis, KIT activating alterations are associated with sensitivity to TKIs including imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib, dasatinib, nilotinib, pazopanib, regorafenib, ponatinib, midostaurin, apatinib, avapritinib, and ripretinib (Heinrich et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 10506, Heinrich et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 11011, DeAngelo et al., 2017; ASH Abstract 2, Evans et al., 2017; 29093181, Abbaspour Babaei et al., 2016; 27536065, Ramaswamy et al., 2016; 27563456, Demetri et al., 2013; 23177515, Gotlib et al., 2016; 27355533, Jawhar et al., 2017; 28424161, Xu et al., 2014; 25031773, Gotlib et al., 2005; 15972446, George et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 11511, Luo et al., 2017; 29066909, Janku et al., 2022; 35753087). The use of mTOR inhibitors as an alternative therapeutic strategy has demonstrated limited success in KIT_mutated, imatinib_resistant melanoma, with 1 PR and 3 SD observed for 4 patients treated with everolimus (Si et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract 8562, Si et al., 2012; 22162580). However, no responses were observed for 10 patients with mastocytosis following everolimus monotherapy, with 8/10 patients harboring the KIT D816V mutation (Parikh et al., 2010; 20038218). The role of KIT amplification as a biomarker for response to mTOR inhibitors has not been investigated (PubMed, Mar 2022). Multiple clinical studies report that inhibitors of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway have not produced significant clinical benefit as monotherapies to treat CRC, even for tumors that harbor alterations in PIK3CA or PTEN; data are more limited for alterations in other genes in this pathway (Ng et al., 2013; 23743569, Ganesan et al., 2013; 24092809, Janku et al., 2014; 24440717).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "KIT amplification or activating mutations may predict sensitivity to small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Nilotinib has been primarily investigated as a therapeutic option for the treatment of CML or gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). In the context of CML, a Phase 3 clinical trial of Ph+ patients treated with imatinib or nilotinib (300 mg or 400 mg) reported progression_free survival (PFS) rates of 93% and 97_98% and overall survival (OS) rates of 93% and 94_97%, respectively, at 4 years (Hughes et al., 2014; 24335106). For imatinib_resistant Japanese patients with CML, a Phase 2 trial reported a 47.8% major medical response rate to treatment with nilotinib at 12 months (Takahashi et al., 2014; 24650752). A Phase 3 clinical trial of single_agent nilotinib in 240 patients with advanced GIST who failed prior treatment with imatinib or sunitinib reported no significant difference in progression_free survival between nilotinib and the best supportive care, but did report increased overall survival for nilotinib_treated patients (Reichardt et al., 2012; 22357255). A Phase 2 trial has shown that nilotinib was well tolerated and suggested it may be particularly useful for treating patients with GIST harboring mutations in KIT exon 17 (Cauchi et al., 2012; 22119758).

A Phase 3 clinical trial of 768 patients with metastatic CRC treated with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) in combination with sunitinib did not show significant clinical benefit; sunitinib in combination with FOLFIRI also showed a poor safety profile (Carrato et al., 2013; 23358972). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT05098847", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05024214", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05014828", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04976634", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04803318", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04008797", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04977453", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03564691", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04729348", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02379416", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "KRAS", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "G12D", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "56.11", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "G12D"}}, "Interpretation": "KRAS encodes a member of the RAS family of small GTPases.

Mutations in KRAS have been reported in approximately 35_50% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) (Lievre et al., 2006; 16618717, De Roock et al., 2011; 21163703, Chen et al., 2014; 25367198, Li et al., 2015; 25929517, Hu et al., 2016; 27977612, Zekri et al., 2017; 28218784, Staudacher et al., 2017; 29048416, Wang et al., 2018; 29705968, Guo et al., 2018; 29666387). Numerous studies have reported that KRAS mutations are associated with increased metastasis, adverse clinicopathological features, and shorter survival of patients with CRC (Chen et al., 2014; 25367198, Li et al., 2015; 25929517, Hu et al., 2016; 27977612, M\u00e1rmol et al., 2017; 28106826, Zekri et al., 2017; 28218784, Kwak et al., 2017; 28858102). Preclinical evidence suggests that KRAS activation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, such as trametinib, binimetinib, cobimetinib, and selumetinib (Nakano et al., 1984; 6320174, Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Yamaguchi et al., 2011; 21523318, Watanabe et al., 2013; 23438367, Gilmartin et al., 2011; 21245089, Yeh et al., 2009; 19372556). However, multiple clinical trials have reported lack of efficacy of trametinib and other MEK inhibitors when used as monotherapy for treatment of patients with KRAS_mutant CRC (Tsimberidou et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract e22086)(Infante et al., 2012; 22805291, Zimmer et al., 2014; 24947927, Bennouna et al., 2011; 20127139, Weekes et al., 2013; 23434733). Both clinical (Hochster et al., 2013; ASCO GI Abstract 380, Juric et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 9051) and preclinical (Lamba et al., 2014; 25199829, Sun et al, 2014; 24685132) studies suggest that combinatorial approaches including MEK inhibitors are likely to be more effective for the treatment of CRC, including strategies such as combination of MEK inhibitors with PI3K inhibitors (Juric et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 9051), RAF inhibitors (Lamba et al., 2014; 25199829), pan_ERBB inhibitors (Sun et al, 2014; 24685132), or chemotherapeutic agents (Hochster et al., 2013; ASCO GI Abstract 380). In a Phase 1 study evaluating the MEK_pan_RAF dual inhibitor CH5126766, 6 patients harboring KRAS mutations experienced PRs, including 3 with non_small cell lung cancer (NCSLC), 1 with low_grade serous ovarian carcinoma (LGSOC), 1 with endometrial adenocarcinoma, and 1 with multiple myeloma (Guo et al., 2020; 33128873). Combination of CH5126766 with the FAK inhibitor defactinib elicited PR rates of 50% (4/8) for patients with KRAS_mutated low_grade serous ovarian cancer and 12% (2/17) for patients with KRAS_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a Phase 1 study (Krebs et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT019, Shinde et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT143). Preclinical and clinical data suggest that KRAS mutations may predict clinical benefit from SHP2 inhibitors (Lu et al., 2019; 31068384, Mainardi et al., 2018; 29808006, Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001, Brana et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3005, Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). A Phase 1 study of RMC_4630 for relapsed/refractory solid tumors reported a DCR of 58% (23/40) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS mutations and a DCR of 75% (12/16) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS G12C mutations (Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001). Interim results from a Phase 1/2 study of RMC_4630 plus cobimetinib reported tumor reduction in 3 of 8 patients with KRAS_mutated colorectal cancer (Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). Preclinical data suggest that KRAS mutation may confer sensitivity to SOS1 inhibitors (Hillig et al., 2019; 30683722, Hofmann et al., 2021; 32816843, Gerlach et al., 2020; AACR Abstract 1091). Phase 1 studies of the SOS1 inhibitor BI 1701963 alone or in combination with MEK inhibitors, KRAS G12C inhibitors, or irinotecan are recruiting for patients with solid tumors harboring KRAS mutations (Hofmann et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT210, Gort et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract TPS3651). Preclinical and limited clinical evidence suggest that KRAS mutation may predict sensitivity to PLK1 inhibitors (Luo et al., 2009; 19490893, Lenz et al., 2020; ASCO GI Abstract TPS265). A Phase 1b/2 study of PLK1 inhibitor onvansertib in combination with FOLFIRI and bevacizumab for patients with KRAS_mutated metastatic CRC previously treated with chemotherapy reported an 87.5% (7/8; 3 PR, 4 SD) clinical benefit rate, with 1 patient going on to successful curative surgery (Barzi et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT235). Activating mutations in KRAS or NRAS are associated with lack of clinical benefit from cetuximab (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Bokemeyer et al., 2011; 21228335, Karapetis et al., 2008; 18946061, De Roock et al., 2008; 17998284) or panitumumab (Douillard et al., 2014; 24718886, Douillard et al., 2012; 24024839, Amado et al., 2008; 18316791) for patients with CRC.

Activating mutations in either KRAS (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Bokemeyer et al., 2011; 21228335, Karapetis et al., 2008; 18946061, De Roock et al., 2008; 17998284) or NRAS (Di Bartolomeo et al., 2013; 23821376, De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739), which function downstream of EGFR, are associated with lack of benefit of cetuximab for patients with CRC and indicate against the use of cetuximab (NCCN Guidelines v1.2022). A study comparing PIK3CA exon 9 and 20 mutations reported that for patients with chemotherapy_refractory CRC, PIK3CA exon 20 mutations were associated with less benefit from cetuximab compared with PIK3CA wildtype (ORR of 0.0% [0/9] vs. 37% [121/329], PFS of 11.5 vs. 24 weeks, and OS of 34 vs. 51 weeks); this effect was not observed with PIK3CA exon 9 mutations (ORR of 29% [6/21] vs. 36% [115/317], PFS of 23.5 vs. 24 weeks, and OS of 46 vs. 51 weeks) (De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739). The presence of PIK3CA exon 9 and 20 mutations showed no correlation with objective tumor response to cetuximab but was associated with reduced PFS in response to cetuximab salvage therapy (HR=2.1) (Souglakos et al., 2009; 19603024). In contrast, multiple studies and case reports of cetuximab treatment of CRC have reported similar responses in patients with PIK3CA exon 9 or 20 mutations compared with PIK3CA wildtype (Cappuzzo et al., 2008; 18577988, Tol et al., 2010; 20413299, Prenan et al., 2009; 19366826, Bray et al., 2019; 31653970, Lambrechts et al., 2009; ASCO Abstract 4020, Karapetis et al., 2013; 24218517, Moiseyenko et al., 2018; 29470838, Fu et al., 2021; 33842311). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> Cetuximab has been shown to improve OS, PFS, and response rate for patients with KRAS_wildtype colorectal cancer (CRC), both in combination with FOLFIRI, FOLFOX4, or irinotecan (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Bokemeyer et al., 2011; 21228335, Jonker et al., 2007; 18003960, Cunningham et al., 2004; 15269313, Papamichael et al., 2022; 35033994) and as monotherapy for chemotherapy_refractory patients (De Roock et al., 2008; 17998284, Karapetis et al., 2014; 24218517). The Phase 3 study STRATEGIC_1 reported a similar duration of disease control (DDC) for patients with unresectable metastatic CRC (mCRC) and KRAS_, NRAS_, and BRAF_wildtype status treated with mFOLFOX_bevacizumab alternated with a cetuximab regimen in first or second line, respectively (overall DDC 22.5 vs. 23.5 months); in addition, the study reported similar OS (37.8 vs. 34.4 months) and higher numerical ORR for patients treated with cetuximab in the first line followed by mFOLFOX_bevacizumab compared with those receiving EGFR_directed antibodies in the second or third line (Chibaudel et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 3504). A prospective study of cetuximab monotherapy for patients with KRAS_, NRAS_, and BRAF_wildtype mCRC reported 11% (2/19) PRs and 58% (11/19) SDs (Moiseyenko et al., 2018; 29470838).

PIK3CA alterations that have been characterized as activating, such as observed here, are predicted to be oncogenic (Kang et al., 2005; 15647370, Ikenoue et al., 2005; 15930273, Gymnopoulos et al., 2007; 17376864, Horn et al., 2008; 18317450, Rudd et al., 2011; 21266528, Hon et al., 2012; 22120714, Burke et al., 2012; 22949682, Wu et al., 2009; 19915146, Dbouk et al., 2010; 2103068, Dan et al., 2010; 20530683, Oda et al., 2008; 18829572, Zhao and Vogt, 2008; 18794883, Lui et al., 2013; 23619167, Ross et al., 2013; 22430209, Riviere et al., 2012; 22729224, Shibata et al., 2009; 19394761, Droguluk et al., 2015; 26627007, Croessmann et al., 2018; 29284706, Ng et al., 2018; 29533785, Spangle et al., 2020; 32929011, Chen et al., 2018; 29636477, Jin et al., 2021; 34779417).

A meta_analysis of 864 patients with colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab_ or panitumumab_based therapy showed that PIK3CA mutations, particularly in exon 20 (H1047R), are significantly associated with worse response (Huang et al., 2014; 24701207) and shorter progression_free and overall survival (De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739). A study of 354 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer observed no difference in overall survival between patients with PIK3CA mutations versus those without (21.7 months vs. 22.4 months, respectively); however, the study did not include treatment information for the patients (Fong et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 57).

However, the Phase 2 study of copanlisib for patients with endometrial carcinoma harboring PIK3CA hotspot mutations failed to report any objective responses (n=11)(Santin et al., 2020; 31934607). Two other studies of copanlisib for patients with genomically unselected tumors reported 1 CR and 2 PRs (1 unconfirmed) among 16 total patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors with or without PTEN alterations (Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108). Emerging evidence suggests that the glutaminase inhibitor telaglenastat has clinical activity in PIK3CA_mutated colorectal cancer (CRC). A Phase 1 trial of telaglenastat and capecitabine for patients with CRC who progressed on fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy observed numerically increased median PFS for patients with PIK3CA mutation compared with patients with wildtype PIK3CA status (24.8 vs. 16 weeks, n=7 vs. n=4), including SD >30 weeks for 3 patients with PIK3CA mutation (Zhao et al., 2020; 32907836). Multiple clinical studies report that inhibitors of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway have not produced significant clinical benefit as monotherapies to treat CRC, even for tumors that harbor alterations in PIK3CA or PTEN; data are more limited for alterations in other genes in this pathway (Ng et al., 2013; 23743569, Ganesan et al., 2013; 24092809, Janku et al., 2014; 24440717). Based on clinical data, it is unclear whether the presence of PIK3CA mutations is associated with reduced sensitivity to cetuximab in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Detection of PIK3CA mutations at progression was observed for patients with CRC following treatment with cetuximab (Xu et al., 2017; 28424201, Kim et al., 2021; 34315006, Soeda et al., 2013; 22638623). A study comparing PIK3CA exon 9 and 20 mutations reported that for patients with chemotherapy_refractory CRC, PIK3CA exon 20 mutations were associated with less benefit from cetuximab compared with PIK3CA wildtype; this effect was not observed with PIK3CA exon 9 mutations (De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739). In contrast, multiple studies and case reports of cetuximab treatment of CRC have reported similar responses in patients with PIK3CA exon 9 or 20 mutations compared with PIK3CA wildtype (Cappuzzo et al., 2008; 18577988, Tol et al., 2010; 20413299, Prenan et al., 2009; 19366826, Bray et al., 2019; 31653970, Lambrechts et al., 2009; ASCO Abstract 4020, Karapetis et al., 2013; 24218517, Moiseyenko et al., 2018; 29470838, Fu et al., 2021; 33842311).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PIK3CA activating mutations may lead to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may therefore indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS colorectal cancers (CRCs) make up 70_85% of CRC cases (Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894). MSS colorectal cancers are molecularly heterogeneous, driven by diverse mechanisms such as extensive DNA methylation, oncogenic mutations in KRAS or BRAF, or chromosomal instability (Jass, 2007; 17204026). Multiple studies have shown that MSS CRCs have a worse prognosis than MSI_high tumors (Samowitz et al., 2001; 11535541, Elsaleh and Iacopetta, 2001; 12445368, Brueckl et al., 2003; 12820457, Guidoboni et al., 2001; 11438476, Gryfe et al., 2000; 10631274, Sinicrope et al., 2006; 16952542, Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Laghi and Malesci, 2012; 22722556). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60). For patients with chemotherapy_refractory microsatellite_stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), a Phase 3 trial reported no OS advantage from the combination of the PD_L1 inhibitor atezolizumab plus cobimetinib relative to regorafenib (8.9 vs. 8.5 months, HR=1.00); atezolizumab monotherapy similarly did not prolong OS (7.1 vs. 8.5 months, HR=1.19) (Ciardiello et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract LBA_004). For patients with MSS CRC, a Phase 2 study combining ipilimumab and nivolumab reported an overall DCR of 25% (10/40) (Parikh et al., 2021; DOI: 10.1038/s43018_021_00269_7). Two Phase 1 studies for patients with MSS CRC treated with regorafenib and nivolumab reported PFSs of 7.9 months (Fukuoka et al., 2020; 32343640) and 5.7 months (Kim et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1016/j.annonc.2020.04.073), and a patient with MSS CRC refractory to chemotherapy treated with the PD_1 inhibitor sintilimab and regorafenib reported a CR (Zhang et al., 2021; 34688262). MSI has not been found to be a predictive biomarker for combination chemotherapy regimens, including FOLFOX (Sinicrope et al., 2013; 24019539, Gavin et al., 2012; 23045248) and FOLFIRI (Bertagnolli et al., 2009; 19273709, Van Cutsem et al., 2009; 19451425). Patients with MSS CRC are more likely to benefit from postsurgical fluorouracil (FU)_based adjuvant therapy (Ribic et al., 2003; 12867608, Sargent et al., 2010; 20498393) but less likely to benefit from irinotecan chemotherapy (Fallik et al., 2003; 14522894).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "NRAS", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "wildtype", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "wildtype"}}, "Interpretation": "NRAS encodes a member of the RAS family of small GTPases that mediate transduction of growth signals. Activation of RAS signaling causes cell growth, differentiation, and survival by activating the RAF_MAPK_ERK, PI3K, and other pathways (Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244). No alterations in NRAS were identified in this case. The majority of colorectal cancers (CRCs) (91_98%) have been reported to lack NRAS mutations (Pentheroudakis et al., 2013; 23374602, Vaughn et al., 2011; 21305640, Janku et al., 2013; 23400451, De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739, Irahara et al., 2010; 20736745, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Schirripa et al., 2015; 24806288, Guo et al., 2018; 29666387). NRAS wild_type status has been reported to be associated with decreased frequency of metastasis (Guo et al., 2018; 29666387) and longer survival (Schirripa et al., 2015; 24806288, Cercek et al., 2017; 28446505) of patients with CRC. Lack of mutations in KRAS or NRAS is associated with clinical benefit of treatment with EGFR_targeting antibodies cetuximab (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Bokemeyer et al., 2011; 21228335, Karapetis et al., 2008; 18946061, De Roock et al., 2008; 17998284) or panitumumab (Douillard et al., 2014; 24718886, Douillard et al., 2012; 24024839, Amado et al., 2008; 18316791) for patients with CRC. Therefore, these agents are indicated to treat patients with CRC lacking such mutations (NCCN Guidelines v1.2022).

A study comparing PIK3CA exon 9 and 20 mutations reported that for patients with chemotherapy_refractory CRC, PIK3CA exon 20 mutations were associated with less benefit from cetuximab compared with PIK3CA wildtype (ORR of 0.0% [0/9] vs. 37% [121/329], PFS of 11.5 vs. 24 weeks, and OS of 34 vs. 51 weeks); this effect was not observed with PIK3CA exon 9 mutations (ORR of 29% [6/21] vs. 36% [115/317], PFS of 23.5 vs. 24 weeks, and OS of 46 vs. 51 weeks) (De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739).

In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "02", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "02"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Fabrizio et al., 2018; 30151257, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526). Elevated tumor mutational burden (TMB) has been reported in 8_25% of colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (George et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3587, Nagahashi et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e15103, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117, Shao et al., 2020; 33119110). Multiple studies have reported that up to 90% of hypermutated CRC cases exhibit high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI_H) and mismatch repair deficiency (MMR_D) (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). Increased TMB is significantly associated with MSI_H and MMR_D, with studies reporting that 100% of MSI_H CRCs harbor elevated TMB and conversely that 100% of tumors with low TMB harbor intact MMR (George et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3587, Nagahashi et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e15103, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). A subset of CRCs that harbor increased TMB but not MSI_H are driven by mutations in POLE, which leads to an \u201cultramutated\u201d phenotype with especially high TMB (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). Tumors with increased TMB harbor BRAF V600E mutations more frequently than those with low TMB (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117), whereas TMB_low tumors more frequently harbor mutations in TP53 and APC (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696). The prognostic value of tumor mutational burden (TMB) in colorectal cancer (CRC) is context_ and therapy_dependent. A study of tissue TMB (tTMB) in 145 CRC samples showed longer OS in TMB_high samples compared with TMB_low ones (Schwartz et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 572). Similarly, for patients with metastatic CRC treated with first_line chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab or cetuximab, high tissue TMB (tTMB_H) was associated with longer OS (Innocenti et al., 2019; 30865548). For patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, tTMB_H was associated with better 5_year relapse_free survival (Lee et al., 2019; 31285374). However, for patients with EGFR/BRAF_inhibitor_treated, BRAF_mutated microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic CRC, intermediate tTMB was associated with significantly poorer PFS and OS compared with TMB_low status; patients with primary resistance to EGFR/BRAF blockage had higher TMB than those sensitive to these therapies (Randon et al., 2022; 34933155). In a study for 61 patients with metastatic, MSS CRC treated with best standard of care, plasma TMB scores \u226528 Muts/Mb (approximately 14 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) were associated with reduced OS compared with plasma TMB scores <28 Muts/Mb (3.0 vs. 5.3 months, HR=0.76, p=0.007), whereas tTMB was not found to be prognostic in this population (Chen et al., 2020; 32379280, Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, increased tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Ott et al., 2019; 30557521, Cristescu et al., 2022; 35101941, Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). In the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors, significant improvement in ORR was observed for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) compared with those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526); similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). At the same TMB cutpoint, retrospective analysis of patients with solid tumors treated with any checkpoint inhibitor identified that tissue TMB scores \u2265 10 Muts/Mb were associated with prolonged time to treatment failure compared with scores <10 muts/Mb (HR=0.68) (Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). For patients with solid tumors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the CheckMate 848 trial, improved responses were observed in patients with a tissue TMB \u2265 10 Muts/Mb independent of blood TMB at any cutpoint in matched samples (Schenker at al., 2022; AACR Abstract 7845). However, support for higher TMB thresholds and efficacy was observed in the prospective Phase 2 MyPathway trial of atezolizumab for patients with pan_solid tumors, where improved ORR and DCR was seen in patients with TMB \u2265 16 Muts/Mb than those with TMB \u2265 10 and <16 Muts/Mb (Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409). Similarly, analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386). In CRC specifically, a retrospective analysis of immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy reported significantly improved OS for patients with tumors harboring TMB \u22659.8 Muts/MB compared with those with tumors with TMB <9.8 Muts/Mb (~ equivalency <12 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254). Another retrospective study reported that a TMB \u226512 Muts/Mb cutoff identifies >99% of MSI_High CRC cases but only 3% of MSS cases, indicating the utility of this cutoff for identification of patients with CRC likely to benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Fabrizio et al., 2018; 30151257).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "APC", "Alteration": "P1443fs*30", "Title": "A Study of E7386 in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Previously Treated Participants With Selected Solid Tumors", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1/2", "Target": "CBP, Beta_catenin, PD_1", "Locations": "Fukuoka (Japan), Osaka (Japan), Shizouka (Japan), Tokyo (Japan), Chiba_shi (Japan), Kashiwa (Japan), Sapporo shi (Japan), Manchester (United Kingdom), Barcelona (Spain), Valencia (Spain)", "NCTID": "NCT05091346", "Note": "Based on preclinical and limited clinical data, APC inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to CBP/beta_catenin interaction inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "APC", "Alteration": "P1443fs*30", "Title": "A Study of E7386 in Combination With Other Anticancer Drug in Participants With Solid Tumor", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "CBP, Beta_catenin, FGFRs, RET, PDGFRA, VEGFRs, KIT", "Locations": "Kurume (Japan), Matsuyama (Japan), Osakasayama (Japan), Nagoya (Japan), Chuo_Ku (Japan), Chiba (Japan), Kashiwa (Japan)", "NCTID": "NCT04008797", "Note": "Based on preclinical and limited clinical data, APC inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to CBP/beta_catenin interaction inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "APC", "Alteration": "P1443fs*30", "Title": "Study of E7386 in Participants With Selected Advanced Neoplasms", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "CBP, Beta_catenin", "Locations": "Glasgow (United Kingdom), Manchester (United Kingdom), Sutton (United Kingdom)", "NCTID": "NCT03264664", "Note": "Based on preclinical and limited clinical data, APC inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to CBP/beta_catenin interaction inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "KIT", "Alteration": "W557C", "Title": "Cryoablation Combined With Sintilimab Plus Lenvatinib In Previously Treated Unresectable Liver Metastasis From Solid Tumors", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "FGFRs, RET, PDGFRA, VEGFRs, KIT, PD_1", "Locations": "Shanghai (China)", "NCTID": "NCT05098847", "Note": "KIT amplification or activating mutations may predict sensitivity to small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
