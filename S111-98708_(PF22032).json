Amplification of CCND1 has been positively correlated with cyclin D1 overexpression (Elsheikh et al., 2008; 17653856) and may lead to excessive proliferation (Fu et al., 2004; 15331580, Takahashi_Yanaga and Sasaguri, 2008; 18023328). CCND1 amplification has been reported in 5_7% of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) in several studies (cBioPortal, Feb 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of CCND1 alterations in HCC are limited (PubMed, Feb 2022). Amplification or overexpression of CCND1 may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib (Juric et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 568, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Tolaney et al., 2016; SABCS P4_22_12, Morschhauser et al., 2020; 32381571, Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27217383, Leonard et al., 2012; 22383795), although as monotherapy these agents have shown limited activity in tumor types other than breast cancer (Dickler et al., 2017; 28533223, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27217383). In refractory advanced solid tumors with CCND1 (n=39) or CCND3 (n=1) amplification and retinoblastoma protein expression, palbociclib resulted in SD for 39% (14/36) of patients and a median PFS of 1.8 months in the NCI_MATCH trial (Clark et al., 2019; AACR Abstract LB_010/2); 4 patients (13%, 4/36 overall) with squamous cell carcinomas (lung, esophageal, or laryngeal) or adenoid cystic carcinoma experienced prolonged SD in this study (Clark et al., 2019; AACR Abstract LB_010/2). Among 9 patients with CCND1_amplified advanced solid tumors, 1 patient with bladder cancer responded to ribociclib in a Phase 2 trial (Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528). CCND1 amplification may predict worse outcomes on immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti_PD_1/PD_L1/CTLA_4) in solid tumors on the basis of 2 meta_analyses (Chen et al., 2020; 32903763, Litchfield et al., 2021; 33508232); in these studies, CCND1 amplification was associated with significantly decreased response rate (Litchfield et al., 2021; 33508232) and OS (HR=1.6_2.0)(Chen et al., 2020; 32903763, Litchfield et al., 2021; 33508232) across various tumor types and significantly shorter OS specifically in urothelial carcinoma (HR=2.2_3.6), melanoma (HR=1.6_2.5), and solid tumors harboring elevated TMB (HR=2.8)(Chen et al., 2020; 32903763, Litchfield et al., 2021; 33508232).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "CCND1 amplification or overexpression may activate CDK4/6 and may predict sensitivity to single_agent CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04282031", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03297606", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02896335", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03065062", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02897375", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "MET", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "MET encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, also known as c_MET or hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR), that is activated by the ligand HGF; MET activation results in signaling mediated partly by the RAS_RAF_MAPK and PI3K pathways to promote proliferation (Appleman, 2011; 22042966, Jung et al., 2012; 22553051). MET has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210), with amplification positively correlating with protein expression in some cancer types (Ang et al., 2013; 23898085, Abou_Bakr and Elbasmi, 2013; 23996864, Ho et al., 2013; 24258573, Dziadziuszko et al., 2012; 22237262, Madoz_G\u00farpide et al., 2015; 26319934) and associating with therapeutic response to MET inhibitors in a variety of cancer types (Kwak et al., 2015; ASCO GI Abstract 01, Ou et al., 2011; 21623265, Schwab et al., 2014; 24192513, Lennerz et al., 2011; 22042947, Chi et al., 2012; 22162573, Palma et al., 2014; 25232318, Le et al., 2015; 25922291, Ali et al., 2015; 25882375, Kwak et al., 2015; 26432108). MET amplification has been reported at frequencies ranging from 3% to 25% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases (cBio_Ahn et al., 2014; 24798001, Zeng et al., 2008; 18395971, Takeo et al., 2001; 11675133, Wang et al., 2013; 23505090, Kondo et al., 2013; 22218908, Lee et al., 2013; 24222167). MET mutation has been reported much more rarely, in 0_1% of cases (cBio_Ahn et al., 2014; 24798001, cBio_Fujimoto et al., 2012; 22634756). Overexpression of MET at protein and mRNA levels is common in HCC and has been found in 27.9%_80.6% of samples (Chu et al., 2013; 23552472, Ang et al., 2013; 23898085, Lee et al., 2013; 24222167). However, MET overexpression has demonstrated low level of correlation with MET amplification (Lee et al., 2013; 24222167, Kondo et al., 2013; 22218908). Multiple studies have reported that alteration or expression of MET is not associated with overall survival in HCC (Personeni et al., 2013; 23568548, Ang et al., 2013; 23898085, Lee et al., 2009; 19140237, Kondo et al., 2013; 22218908, Lee et al., 2013; 24222167). On the basis of extensive clinical evidence, MET amplification or activating mutations may predict sensitivity to MET_targeting therapies such as kinase inhibitors crizotinib, capmatinib, tepotinib, and cabozantinib. In a Phase 2 study, patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and high MET expression achieved a 30.0% ORR (3/10, 1 CR) when treated with capmatinib; no responses (n=20) were observed for patients with lower MET expression (Qin et al., 2019; 31853265). A Phase 1 capmatinib trial reported SD as the best response for patients with MET_amplified advanced HCC (Bang et al., 2020; 31778267). Crizotinib has benefited patients with MET_amplified non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of varied histologies (Vassal et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 2595, Li et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 8090, Ou et al., 2011; 21623265, Schwab et al., 2014; 24192513, Le et al., 2015; 25922291, Schrock et al., 2017; 28315738), gastroesophageal cancer (Lennerz et al., 2011; 22042947), glioblastoma (Chi et al., 2012; 22162573), and carcinoma of unknown primary (Palma et al., 2014; 25232318). Capmatinib has demonstrated clinical efficacy for patients with MET_amplified NSCLC both as a monotherapy (Schuler et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9067, Wu et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P1.01_97) and in combination with an EGFR_TKI for patients with concurrent activating EGFR mutations (Wu et al., 2018; 30156984, Gainor et al., 2020; 31864558, Gautschi et al., 2020; 31864554). Tepotinib has demonstrated efficacy for patients with MET_amplified hepatocellular carcinoma (Faivre et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 329) and NSCLC (Le et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9021) as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with gefitinib for patients with MET_amplified and EGFR_mutated NSCLC (Yang et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT193, Park et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 477O, Wu et al., 2019; IASLC Abstract MA09.09). Savolitinib elicited responses in patients with MET_amplified papillary renal cell carcinoma (Gan et al., 2019; 30952639) and gastric cancer either alone or in combination with docetaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834, Kim et al., 2019; 30695737). AMG 337 elicited an ORR of 50% (5/10), including 1 CR, for patients with MET_amplified gastric, esophageal, or gastroesophageal junction cancer (Kwak et al., 2015; ASCO GI Abstract 01). Patients with MET_amplified NSCLC (Spigel et al., 2013; 24101053) or MET_amplified gastric cancer (Catenacci et al., 2011; 22389872) treated with the MET_targeting antibody onartuzumab (MetMAb) achieved clinical responses. In addition, high MET expression has been suggested to predict patient response to therapies such as the monoclonal HGF_targeting antibody rilotumumab, as well as the combination of ramucirumab and the monoclonal MET_targeting antibody emibetuzumab (Oliner et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract 4005, Harding et al., 2019; 31142504). A first_in_human Phase 1 trial of telisotuzumab vedotin (teliso_V), a MET antibody_drug conjugate, reported activity in a subset of patients with MET_positive NSCLC, with an ORR of 19% (3/16) and a DCR of 56% (9/16); no responses were observed in any other patients (Strickler et al., 2019; 30285518). A subsequent Phase 2 trial of teliso_V in patients with MET_positive NSCLC reported a 35% (13/37) ORR in patients with non_squamous, EGFR_wildtype tumors, which met the prespecified criteria for transition to the next stage; lower ORRs were observed in patients with squamous (14%; 3/21) or non_squamous EGFR_mutated (13%; 4/30) tumors (Camidge et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT179).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Activating MET alterations may confer sensitivity to MET inhibitors.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Capmatinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Capmatinib is a selective MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is FDA approved to treat patients with non_small cell lung cancer harboring MET exon 14 skipping_associated alterations.

Crizotinib has also benefited patients with MET_mutated renal cell carcinoma (Diamond et al., 2013; 23610116) and patients with MET_amplified gastroesophageal cancer, glioblastoma, and carcinoma of unknown primary (Lennerz et al., 2011; 22042947, Shi et al., 2012; 22162573, Palma et al., 2014; 25232318). While a Phase 1b study evaluating crizotinib for the treatment of patients with ALK_positive malignancies, reported ORR of 52.9% (9/17) and 66.7% (6/9) in patients with lymphoma and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMT), respectively, an ORR of 11.8% (2/17) was reported for patients with other types of tumors (Gambacorti_Passerini et al., 2017; ASH Abstract 4128). Whereas median PFS and median OS were not reached for patients with lymphoma or IMT, median PFS was 1.3 months and median OS was 8.3 months for patients with other tumor types, and the median duration of treatment was ~1 month relative to 1_3 years for patients with lymphoma or IMT (Gambacorti_Passerini et al., 2017; ASH Abstract 4128). A Phase 1 clinical trial of crizotinib in pediatric solid tumors reported objective responses in 14/79 patients, including nine CRs and five PRs; response was enriched in patients with activating alterations in ALK (Moss\u00e9 et al., 2013; 23598171). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT03175224", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03755791", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04588051", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03899428", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04647838", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03170960", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03297606", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04497038", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04522908", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04511455", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Blood Tumor Mutational Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "01", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "01"}}, "Interpretation": "Blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations from circulating tumor DNA in blood.

High bTMB levels were not detected in this sample. It is unclear whether the bTMB levels in this sample would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Depending on the clinical context, TMB testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. Average bTMB levels in solid tumors other than NSCLC have not been evaluated (cBioPortal, COSMIC, PubMed, Mar 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of bTMB levels in HCC are limited (PubMed, Jul 2021). In an analysis of the TCGA Liver HCC dataset, high TMB was associated with reduced PFS and OS (Shrestha et al., 2018; 30057891). A retrospective study of 128 patients with HCC who underwent curative resection reported decreased recurrence_free survival for patients with high TMB (>4.8 Muts/Mb) compared to those with low TMB (\u22644.8 Muts/Mb) measured in tissue samples (Cai et al., 2020; 31995247). On the basis of clinical evidence in NSCLC and HSNCC, increased bTMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511) and anti_PD_1 (Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074) therapies. In NSCLC, multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 to 16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). In HNSCC, a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "FGF19", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "FGF19 encodes fibroblast growth factor 19, an FGFR4 ligand involved with bile acid synthesis and hepatocyte proliferation in the liver (Xie et al., 1999; 10525310, Hagel et al., 2015; 25776529). FGF19 lies in a region of chromosome 11q13 frequently amplified in a diverse range of malignancies that also contains FGF3, FGF4, and CCND1 (Katoh et al., 2002; 12429977). Correlation between FGF19 amplification and protein expression has been demonstrated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Kan et al., 2013; 23788652) but was not observed in several other tumor types (Sawey et al., 2011; 21397858). In the TCGA datasets, FGF19 amplification has been reported in esophageal carcinoma (34%), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (23%), breast carcinoma (15%), lung squamous cell carcinoma (13%), and cholangiocarcinoma (11%) (cBioPortal, Jan 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). In HCC, FGF19 is an important driver gene (Desnoyers et al., 2008; 17599042, Sawey et al., 2011; 21397858, Hagel et al., 2015; 25776529), and FGF19 protein expression correlates with tumor progression and poorer prognosis (Miura et al., 2012; 22309595). Exogenous FGF19 has been shown to promote prostate cancer tumorigenesis in a preclinical study (Feng et al., 2013; 23440425), and the presence of FGF19_positive tissues is an independent factor for worse prognosis following radical prostatectomy (Nagamatsu et al., 2015; 25854696). There are no targeted therapies that directly address genomic alterations in FGF19. However, FGF19 amplification predicts sensitivity to FGFR4 inhibitors in liver cancer cell lines (Guagnano et al., 2012; 23002168, Hatlan et al., 2019; 31575540); selective FGFR4 inhibition reduced tumor burden in an FGF19_amplified HCC xenograft model (Hagel et al., 2015; 25776529). A Phase 1 study of the FGFR4 inhibitor fisogatinib (BLU_554) for patients with previously treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), most of whom had received prior sorafenib treatment, reported a 16.7% ORR (11/66, 1 CR, ongoing for >1.5 years) and a median PFS of 3.3 months for FGF19_IHC_positive patients; poorer outcomes (0% ORR, PFS of 2.3 months) were observed for patients with negative or unknown FGF19 IHC scores (Kim et al., 2019; 31575541). Acquisition of FGFR4 mutations may represent a mechanism of resistance for patients with FGF19 overexpression who initially responded but then progressed on fisogatinib (Hatlan et al., 2019; 31575540). Preliminary results from the dose escalation part of a Phase 1/2 study evaluating another FGFR4 inhibitor, FGF401, showed an ORR of 7.6% (4/53), SD rate of 52.8% (28/53), and a median time to progression of 4.1 months; responses were observed in both FGF19_positive and FGF19_negative cases (Chan et al., 2017; AACR Abstract CT106/24). In a retrospective analysis, a trend toward response to sorafenib treatment and FGF19 copy number gain was observed in patients with HCC, and 2 patients harboring FGF19 copy number gain experienced a CR (Kaibori et al., 2016; 27384874). A case study reported activity of pan_FGFR inhibitors in FGF_amplified cancers; following treatment with a selective pan_FGFR inhibitor, a patient with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and amplification of 11q13 (FGF3, FGF4, FGF19) and 12p13 (FGF6 and FGF23) experienced a radiologic CR (Dumbrava et al., 2018; 31123723).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942).

TET2 alterations have been reported at relatively low frequencies in solid tumors and are more prevalent in hematological malignancies (cBioPortal, Jan 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210).

There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in TET2 in solid tumors.

In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may also be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as APR_246 (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571, Lehmann et al., 2012; 22965953, Mohell et al., 2015; 26086967, Franssonet al., 2016; 27179933). In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, APR_246 combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Fraction", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor fraction provides an estimate of the percentage of ctDNA present in a cell_free DNA (cfDNA) sample. The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with elevated tumor fraction have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus high sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at low risk of false negative results. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels. In the research setting, changes in tumor fraction estimates have been associated with treatment duration and clinical response and may be a useful indicator for future cancer management (Bronkhorst
