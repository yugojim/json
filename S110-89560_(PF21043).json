ERRFI1 directly binds to the kinase domain of ERBB proteins and consequently antagonizes their oncogenic signaling and cell proliferation (Anastasi et al., 2003; 12833145, Anastasi et al., 2007; 17599051, Zhang et al., 2007; 18046415, Anastasi et al., 2005; 15856022). ERRFI1 also negatively regulates signaling by promoting EGFR endocytosis and degradation (Frosi et al., 2010; 20421427, Ying et al., 2010; 20351267). Knockout or depletion of ERRFI1 was shown to result in EGFR and ERBB2/ERBB3 activation (Fiorini et al., 2002; 12226756, Ferby et al., 2006; 16648858, Reschke et al., 2010; 20044804, Ying et al., 2010; 20351267), and disruption of the ERRFI1 gene promoted tumorigenesis in mice (Ferby et al., 2006; 16648858, Zhang et al., 2007; 16819504), whereas overexpression of ERRFI1 inhibited EGFR_ or ERBB2_mediated signaling and oncogenic transformation in vitro (Hackel et al., 2001; 11843178, Fiorentino et al., 2000; 11003669, Ying et al., 2010; 20351267). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt ERRFI1 function or expression (Zhang et al., 2007; 18046415, Anastasi et al., 2003; 12833145). ERRFI1 mutations were not detected in several cholangiocarcinoma sequencing studies and in <1% of biliary tract carcinomas (COSMIC, Feb 2021)(cBio_Chan_On et al., 2013; 24185513, cBio_Ong et al., 2012; 22561520, cBio_Jiao et al., 2013; 24185509) (Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). ERRFI1 mutations have been reported in 1_10% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases in the TCGA datasets (cBio_Ahn et al., 2014; 24798001, cBio_Fujimoto et al., 2012; 22634756). In the literature, ERRFI1 has been reported in 3_13% of HCC cases and ERRFI1 expression loss has been associated with hepatocyte proliferation (Deleon et al., 2018; 29460642). One study reports that higher ERRFI1 expression is associated with longer OS amongst patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (P < 0.05) (Ciu et al., 2021; 34608122). ERRFI1 loss or inactivating mutations may result in EGFR activation and predict sensitivity to ERBB tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, and lapatinib, which are approved to treat lung or breast cancers. One patient with cholangiocarcinoma and an ERRFI1 loss of function mutation was reported to have a partial response to the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib (Borad et al., 2014; 24550739). In preclinical studies, the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib was reported to cause regression of tumors in ERRFI1 knockout mice (Ferby et al., 2006; 16648858) and inhibit signaling downstream EGFR in ERRFI1_depleted human cell lines (Walsh and Lazarra., 2013; 23868981).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "ERRFI1 loss or inactivating mutations may result in EGFR activation and predict sensitivity to ERBB tyrosine kinase inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": {"nctId": "NCT03768375", "Include": "true"}}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "FBXW7", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "E287fs*55", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "E287fs*55"}}, "Interpretation": "FBXW7 encodes the F_box protein subunit of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets proteins for degradation (Welcker and Clurman, 2008; 18094723). FBXW7 inactivation is associated with chromosomal instability and with stabilization of proto_oncogenes, such as mTOR, MYC, cyclin E, NOTCH, and JUN; FBXW7 is therefore considered a tumor suppressor (Akhoondi et al., 2007; 17909001, Welcker and Clurman, 2008; 18094723). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt FBXW7 function or expression (Welcker et al., 2013; 24298052, Welcker et al., 2007; 17298674, Strohmaier et al., 2001; 11565034, Pashkova et al., 2010; 21070969, Akhoondi et al., 2007; 17909001, O Neil et al., 2007; 17646409, Malyukova et al., 2013; 23228967, Thompson et al., 2007; 17646408). FBXW7 amplification and mutation have been observed in 0.5% (2/370) and in up to 1.6%, respectively, of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples (cBioPortal, COSMIC, Nov 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). FBXW7 mutations were found in 35% (7/20) of cholangiocarcinomas in one study (Akhoondi et al., 2007; 17909001) and in 15% (3/20) of extrahepatic, compared to 5.5% (3/55) of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas in another (Churi et al., 2014; 25536104). Protein and mRNA expression of FBXW7 has been reported to be significantly downregulated in HCC tumors compared to the adjacent normal tissue, and lower FBXW7 protein levels were associated with high histological grade and advanced tumor\u2013node\u2013metastasis stage (Tu et al., 2012; 22548670, Imura et al., 2014; 24731221). Low FBXW7 protein expression was associated with increased metastasis or inferior survival in patients with cholangiocarcinoma (Enkhbold et al., 2014; 24552289, Churi et al., 2014; 25536104). Positive FBXW7 protein expression independently predicted better 5_year overall survival in two studies of patients with surgically resected HCC (Tu et al., 2014; 24884509, Wang et al., 2015; 25955618). FBXW7 inactivating alterations may indicate sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors (Mao et al., 2008; 18787170, Yang et al., 2015; 25749036). Several case studies reported clinical benefit for patients with FBXW7_mutated cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma (Villaruz and Socinski, 2014; 24360397), renal cell carcinoma (Olson et al., 2016; 27079472), and cervical squamous cell carcinoma (Kulkarni et al., 2020; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygyno.2020.05.244). FBXW7 inactivation may also result in resistance to anti_tubulin chemotherapies based on results from preclinical studies (Wertz et al., 2011; 21368834).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Loss or inactivation of FBXW7 may lead to increased mTOR activation and may predict sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Everolimus", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Everolimus is an orally available mTOR inhibitor that is FDA approved to treat renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following antiangiogenic therapy; pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors; and well_differentiated non_functional neuroendocrine tumors of the lung or gastrointestinal tract.

Another Phase 2 study of everolimus in patients with biliary tract cancer reported 7.4% (2/27) PR, 48.1% (13/27) SD, and a median PFS of 6 months (Yeung et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 4101). An observational study of everolimus in biliary tract cancer reported a disease control rate of 50%, but a high incidence (64%) of severe toxicities in patients with biliary tract cancer (Verzoni et al., 2014; 25145431). A Phase 1 trial of everolimus combined with sorafenib reported SD >10 weeks in 62% of cholangiocarcinoma patients (You et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2532). A Phase 1 trial evaluating everolimus in combination with gemcitabine and/or cisplatin for the treatment of patients with solid tumors reported 0% PR, 60% SD, and 40% PD in an expansion cohort of 10 patients with cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder carcinoma (Costello et al., 2014; 24740268). Although Phase 1/2 studies of everolimus in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) reported that everolimus was well tolerated and had preliminary anti_tumor activity (Zhu et al., 2011; 21538343, Shiah et al., 2013; 23134470), the EVOLVE_1 Phase 3 trial of single_agent everolimus in patients with HCC who had failed sorafenib treatment reported that everolimus did not significantly extend overall survival, median time to progression, or disease control rate in comparison with placebo (Zhu et al., 2014; 25058218). Everolimus_based immunosuppression significantly extended survival and decreased rate of recurrence in patients with HCC who had undergone liver transplant (Ferreiro et al., 2014; 25498079, Cholongitas et al., 2014; 24943720). Studies of everolimus in combination with sorafenib for the treatment of HCC showed limited efficacy, and one study reported considerable adverse effects (Finn et al., 2013; 23928403, De Simone et al., 2014; 24507059). 15 patients with HCC and low TSC2 expression tended to have a longer overall survival in response to everolimus (9.5_32.7 months) when compared to placebo (1.3_5.6 months) (Huynh et al., 2015; 25724664). Whereas frequent adverse events precluded a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for the combination of trametinib and everolimus in a Phase 1b trial for solid tumors (Tolcher et al., 2014; 25344362), a retrospective study for heavily pretreated patients with solid tumors reported tolerable regimens of the combination for 23/31 patients, with 16 patients treated >3 months and evaluable patients achieving a median PFS of 6.5 months (Patterson et al., 2018; AACR Abstract 3891). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Temsirolimus", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Temsirolimus is an intravenous mTOR inhibitor that is FDA approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma.

Out of 18 evaluable patients treated with a combination of temsirolimus and doxorubicin in a Phase 1 trial, two achieved a PR (one in a patient with HCC) and 6 achieved stable disease (SD) (one in a patient with HCC) (Wang_Gillam et al., 2014; 24916546). A Phase 1 trial of 25 patients with HCC treated with sorafenib and temsirolimus reported 2 (8%) patients with a confirmed PR and 15 (60%) with SD, warranting further study of the combination treatment (Kelley et al., 2013; 23519998). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT03591965", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03239015", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03768375", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04803318", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03297606", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03190174", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03217669", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03065062", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT01582191", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02159989", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "IDH1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "R132C", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "R132C"}}, "Interpretation": "The isocitrate dehydrogenases IDH1 and IDH2 encode highly homologous enzymes that are involved in the citric acid (TCA) cycle and other metabolic processes, playing roles in normal cellular metabolism and in protection against oxidative stress and apoptosis (Reitman and Yan, 2010; 20513808). R132 is located within the active site of IDH1 and is a hotspot for mutations in cancer (Jin et al., 2011; 21326614, Gross et al., 2010; 20142433, Ward et al., 2010; 20171147, Leonardi et al., 2012; 22442146, Reitman and Yan, 2010; 20513808). Substitutions at IDH1 R132 alter the enzymatic activity of IDH1, resulting in the production of the oncometabolite, D_2_hydroxyglutarate (2_HG)(Dang et al., 2009; 19935646, Ward et al., 2012; 21996744, Ward et al., 2010; 20171147, Gross et al., 2010; 20142433, Leonardi et al., 2012; 22442146), which promotes tumorigenesis (Gross et al., 2010; 20142433, Figueroa et al., 2010; 21130701, Xu et al., 2011; 21251613, Turcan et al., 2012; 22343889, Duncan et al., 2012; 22899282). In the literature, IDH1 or IDH2 mutations have been observed in 11_35% of combined HCC and cholangiocarcinoma cases (Chen et al., 2017; 28431889, Sasaki et al., 2017; 27634656). IDH1 or IDH2 mutation has been reported in 10_23% of cholangiocarcinoma cases and has been found to be more prevalent in intrahepatic (22_28%) than extrahepatic (0_7%) cholangiocarcinomas (Voss et al., 2013; 23391413, Sia et al., 2013; 23318457, Kipp et al., 2012; 22503487, Ross et al., 2014; 24563076, Borger et al., 2012; 22180306, Wang et al., 2013; 22824796). While frequent in cholangiocarcinoma, IDH1 mutations (predominantly at codon R132)(Ross et al., 2014; 24563076), have either been infrequently detected or undetected in gallbladder or pancreatic carcinomas (cBio_Li et al., 2014; 24997986, cBio_Bailey et al., 2016; 26909576, cBio_Biankin et al., 2012; 23103869, cBio_Witkiewicz et al., 2015; 25855536). IDH1/2 mutations in combined HCC and cholangiocarcinoma did not correlate with any clinicopathological features (Sasaki et al., 2017; 27634656). In patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, IDH1/2 mutations are associated with longer OS and increased time to tumor recurrence (Wang et al., 2013; 22824796). A preclinical study observed that mutant IDH can block hepatocyte differentiation and cooperate with oncogenic KRAS to drive cholangiocarcinoma development (Saha et al., 2014; 25043045). IDH1 mutations that lead to production of 2_HG, most commonly R132 alterations, may predict sensitivity to IDH1_mutation_specific inhibitors such as ivosidenib (Abou_Alfa et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA10, Fan et al., 2019; 31028664, Mellinghoff et al., 2017; SNO Abstract ACTR_46, Tap et al., 2016; CTOS Abstract P1_138). A Phase 1b/2 study of the IDH1 inhibitor olutasidenib for patients with IDH1_mutated glioma reported a DCR of 50% (n=24) with 1 PR (De La Fuente et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 2505).

Preclinical studies suggested that IDH1 neomorphic mutations may also confer sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Philip et al., 2018; 29719265, Molenaar et al., 2018; 29339439, Lu et al., 2017; 28202508, Sulkowski et al., 2017; 28148839).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "IDH1 mutations may predict sensitivity to IDH1 inhibitors.

Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TSC2 function or expression (Hodges et al., 2001; 11741833, Jozwiak, 2006; 16206276, Li et al., 2004; 15340059). TSC2 mutation has been reported in 2.4% of ampullary adenocarcinomas and 2.2% of biliary tract tumors analyzed in the COSMIC database, including 2.2% gallbladder adenocarcinomas and 1.8% bile duct carcinomas (Oct 2021)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). TSC2 mutation was also detected in one cholangiocarcinoma sample in a genomic profiling study of 28 cholangiocarcinomas (Ross et al., 2014; 24563076). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of TSC2 alteration in biliary tract carcinomas are limited (PubMed, Sep 2021). Loss or inactivation of TSC2 can activate mTOR signaling (Tee et al., 2003; 12906785, Mallela et al., 2021; 33575875). MTOR inhibitors such as everolimus, temsirolimus, and sirolimus have shown activity against tumors associated with the genetic disease tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), including subependymal giant_cell astrocytomas and renal angiomyolipomas (Kwiatkowski et al., 2015; 25782670, Choi et al., 2020; EAU Abstract 103, Wang et al., 2020; 31597506, Guo et al., 2021; 33575217, Espinosa et al., 2018; 29764404, Chuang et al., 2017; 28547571). In the context of TSC2_altered malignancies unrelated to TSC, MTOR inhibitor activity has been limited (Adib et al., 2021; 33727259, Nassar et al., 2020; 31653662, Voss et al., 2019; 3032730), with the exception of perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas)(Wagner et al., 2010; 20048174, Dickson et al., 2013; 22927055) and anecdotal reports across various solid tumors including anaplastic thyroid cancer (Wagle et al., 2014; 25295501), renal cell carcinoma (RCC)(Tannir et al., 2015; 26626617, Maroto et al., 2018; 29632054), glioblastoma (Zureick et al., 2019; 31154346), and CNS embryonal tumor (Wu et al., 2020; 33344249), as well as a case of Hodgkin lymphoma (Perini et al., 2016; 27176796). In the prospective NCI_MATCH study, only 6.7% (1/15) of patients with TSC2_mutated solid tumors responded to everolimus, with the single response reported for a patient with uterine leiomyosarcoma (Adib et al., 2021; 33727259). Retrospective analyses of the RECORD_3, GRANITE_1, and EVOLVE_1 studies of everolimus to treat patients with RCC, gastric cancer, or hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively, showed no significant association between alterations in MTOR, TSC1, or TSC2 and median PFS (Voss et al., 2019; 30327302). Inactivating germline mutations in TSC2 are associated with the autosomal dominant disorder tuberous sclerosis complex, which results in the development of hamartomas in multiple organ systems and an increased risk of developing renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (Gomez, 1991; 2039135, Kandt et al., 1992; 1303246, European Chromosome 16 Tuberous Sclerosis Consortium, 1993; 8269512). TSC2 mutations account for approximately 75 to 80% of reported sporadic cases (Curatolo et al., 2008; 18722871). Prevalence for this disorder in the general population is estimated to be 1/6,000 from birth and 1/12,000 to 1/14,000 in children under 10 years of age (Curatolo et al., 2008; 18722871).

High bTMB levels were not detected in this sample. It is unclear whether the bTMB levels in this sample would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Depending on the clinical context, TMB testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. Average bTMB levels in solid tumors other than NSCLC have not been evaluated (cBioPortal, COSMIC, PubMed, Mar 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of bTMB levels in biliary tract cancer are limited (PubMed, Jul 2021). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of bTMB levels in HCC are limited (PubMed, Jul 2021). Although cases with hypermutated biliary tract cancer were enriched in a subgroup with poor prognosis in 1 study (Nakamura et al., 2015; 26258846), TMB_high (\u226510 mut/Mb) status in biliary adenocarcinoma not treated with immunotherapy was not significantly associated with OS in another study, in which patients with TMB_high tumors experienced numerically longer OS compared with patients with TMB_low tumors (11.5 vs. 8.4 months, adjusted HR=0.65) (Shao et al., 2020; 33119110). In an analysis of the TCGA Liver HCC dataset, high TMB was associated with reduced PFS and OS (Shrestha et al., 2018; 30057891). A retrospective study of 128 patients with HCC who underwent curative resection reported decreased recurrence_free survival for patients with high TMB (>4.8 Muts/Mb) compared to those with low TMB (\u22644.8 Muts/Mb) measured in tissue samples (Cai et al., 2020; 31995247). On the basis of clinical evidence in NSCLC and HSNCC, increased bTMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511) and anti_PD_1 (Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074) therapies. In NSCLC, multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 to 16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). In HNSCC, a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "DNMT3A", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": [{"Name": "S352fs*55, L653*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": [{"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "S352fs*55"}, {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "L653*"}]}, "Interpretation": "The DNMT3A gene encodes the protein DNA methyltransferase 3A, an enzyme that is involved in the methylation of newly synthesized DNA, a function critical for gene regulation (Trowbridge and Orkin, 2012; 22200773, Ch\u00e9din, 2011; 21507354).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI_H was not detected in a study of 122 hepatocellular (HCC) samples (Goumard et al., 2017; 28871000), although smaller studies have reported MSI in 0_18% of tumors (Gross_Goupil et al., 2003; 12640682, Zhang et al., 2005; 15918185, Chiappini et al., 2004; 14656944, Salvucci et al., 1999; 9926933, Wang et al., 2001; 11494037), and MSI at some level has been detected in a subset of HCC tumors (Goumard et al., 2017; 28871000). MSI_H is infrequent in cholangiocarcinoma, reported in 1% of samples (Javle et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 4087). A non_zero level of MSI has been reported in 18_49% of cholangiocarcinoma cases (Momoi et al., 2001; 11580146, Limpaiboon et al., 2002; 12175538, Liu et al., 2002; 12402306, Liengswangwong et al., 2003; 14506736), although the studies did not specify what fraction of cases were MSI_H. A higher frequency of MSI (63%) was reported in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma associated with exposure to Thorotrast (Liu et al., 2002; 12402306). The prognostic significance of MSI in HCC has not been determined (PubMed, Jun 2021). One study reported that MSI is associated with poor prognosis in liver fluke_related cholangiocarcinoma (Limpaiboon et al., 2002; 12175538). On the basis of prospective clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD_1_targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143) and PD_L1_targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92). As the MSI status of this tumor is unknown, the relevance of these therapeutic approaches is unclear. While approximately 80% of MSI_H tumors arise due to somatic inactivation of an MMR pathway protein, about 20% arise due to germline mutations in one of the MMR genes (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942), which are associated with a condition known as Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC) (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756). Lynch syndrome leads to an increased risk of colorectal, endometrial, gastric, and other cancers (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756, Pande et al., 2012; 22714864, Kastrinos and Syngal, 2007; 17920897) and has an estimated prevalence in the general population ranging from 1:600 to 1:2000 (Silva et al., 2009; 19466295, Sehgal et al., 2014; 24978665, de la Chapelle et al., 2005; 16136383).

TP53 has been reported to be the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor in HCC, with mutations identified in 16_35% of cases (Kan et al., 2013; 23788652, Liu et al., 2012; 22459764, Kalinina et al., 2013; 23830926). Significantly higher rates of TP53 mutation have been reported in HCC associated with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C infections compared to other types of HCC (Guerrieri et al., 2013; 23749671, Long et al., 2013; 23624687, Tornesello et al., 2013; 23583669). TP53 mutations have been reported in 5_44% of cholangiocarcinomas (Li et al., 2014; 24997986, Ross et al., 2014; 24563076, Jiao et al., 2013; 24185509, Chan_On et al., 2013; 24185513, Borger et al., 2012; 22180306, Suto et al., 2000; 10738270, Javle et al., 2016; 27622582). Expression of p53 has been variously identified in 35_96% of HCC cases (Liu et al., 2012; 22459764, Kang et al., 2014; 24516705). Data regarding the prognostic significance of TP53 mutation in cholangiocarcinoma are conflicting (Ruzzenente et al., 2016; 26717940, Xiaofang et al., 2012; 22230750, Ajiki et al., 1996; 8799388, Saetta, 2006; 16724348, Guo et al., 2014; 24746206, Boerner et al., 2021; 33765338, Conci et al., 2020; 32020551, Simbolo et al., 2018; 29740198, Churi et al., 2014; 25536104). Overexpression of p53 protein has been associated with reduced patient survival in poorly differentiated gallbladder adenocarcinomas and biliary tract cancers (Lee and Pirdas, 1995; 7567135, Ahrendt et al., 2000; 11180865); however, another study did not find such a correlation (Ajiki et al., 1996; 8799388). Studies have reported that patients with HCC harboring TP53 mutation and/or p53 upregulation experienced significantly shorter recurrence_free survival and overall survival (Ji et al., 2013; 24078450, Zhan and Ji, 2014; 24696834, Kang et al., 2014; 24516705, Liu et al., 2012; 22459764). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% (17/176) and SDs in 53.4% (94/176) of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21.1% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12.1% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wild_type (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 31.9% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73.4% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 42.9% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76.2% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24.0% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71.4% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75.0% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Additionally, the combination of a CHK1 inhibitor and irinotecan reportedly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival in a TP53_mutated, but not TP53_wild_type, breast cancer xenotransplant mouse model (Ma et al., 2012; 22446188). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may also be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as APR_246 (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571, Lehmann et al., 2012; 22965953, Mohell et al., 2015; 26086967, Franssonet al., 2016; 27179933). In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, APR_246 combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Fraction", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Cannot Be Determined", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Cannot Be Determined"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor fraction provides an estimate of the percentage of ctDNA present in a cell_free DNA (cfDNA) sample. The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). However, the tumor fraction estimate in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with high tumor fraction values have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus higher sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at a lower risk of false negative results (Li et al., 2021; AACR Abstract 2231). However, if tumor fraction is not detected as high, it does not exclude the presence of disease burden or compromise the confidence of reported alterations. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels. In the research setting, changes in tumor fraction estimates have been associated with treatment duration and clinical response and may be a useful indicator for future cancer management (Bronkhorst
