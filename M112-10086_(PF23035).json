APC interacts with beta_catenin and controls signaling in the WNT pathway, which regulates embryonic development and cell differentiation (Logan and Nusse, 2004; 15473860). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt APC function or expression (Eklof et al., 2001; 11707392, Liu et al., 2006; 16753179, Dikovskaya et al., 2010; 20144988, Murphy et al., 2007; 17410430, Aretz et al., 2004; 15459959). APC mutations have been found in 73% of tumors in the colorectal adenocarcinoma TCGA dataset (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696). In 1 study, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of APC was observed in 32% of colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (Christie et al., 2013; 23085758). The prognostic significance of APC mutations in sporadic CRC remains unclear (Quyn et al., 2008; 19110823). Solid tumors with WNT/beta_catenin pathway alterations, as seen here, were observed to have significantly less T_cell inflammation in one study (Luke et al., 2019; 30635339). There are no approved drugs targeting APC inactivation in cancer. Loss of APC function leads to accumulation of beta_catenin and upregulation of WNT pathway transcription programs (Zhan et al., 2017; 27617575), and potential therapeutic approaches to target this pathway include CBP/beta_catenin antagonists, which interfere with the ability of beta_catenin to interact with transcriptional co_activator CBP (Jung et al., 2020; 32037398, Krishnamurthy and Kurzrock, 2018; 29169144). In a Phase 1 trial of the CBP/beta_catenin antagonist E7386, 1 patient with APC_mutated small bowel adenocarcinoma achieved a PR with tumor shrinkage of _69% and response duration of 165 days (Kawazoe et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 473P); preclinical data support sensitivity of APC_deficient gastric or colorectal cancer models to E7386 (Yamada et al., 2021; 33408116, Kanda et al., 2022; 34837838). One or more of the APC variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (ClinVar, Sep 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in APC are found in more than 90% of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) (Kerr et al., 2013; 23159591, Fearon, 2011; 21090969, Kastritis et al., 2009; 18844223).

CCND2 has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210), and may be biologically relevant in this context (Zack et al., 2013; 24071852, Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). In the Colorectal Adenocarcinoma TCGA dataset, putative high_level amplification of CCND2 has been found in 1.4% of cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696). Cyclin D2 has also reportedly been overexpressed in 53% of colorectal adenocarcinomas (Mermelshtein et al., 2005; 16012517). Overexpression of CCND2 mRNA in CRC has been correlated with poor patient prognosis (Liu et al., 2010; 21052002). In addition, the expression of cyclin D2 at the invasive margin has been associated with liver metastasis in colorectal cancer, and in patients with Stage 1 and 2 tumors, cyclin D2 expression has also been associated with reduced patient survival (Sarkar et al., 2010; 19508551). Although preclinical studies suggest that cyclin D2 activates CDK4/6 (Busk et al., 2005; 15707582, Busk, 2003; 12695654), it is unknown whether CCND2 amplification or activating mutation predicts response to CDK4/6 inhibitors such as abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib. Clinical studies of CDK4/6 inhibitors have shown the most promise for estrogen receptor_positive breast cancer (Finn et al., 2014; 25524798, DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "CCND2 amplification or activation may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04282031", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05480280", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03994796", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05252416", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02896335", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04616183", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05159245", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03310879", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03454035", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "ERBB2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "T798I", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "39.22", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "T798I"}}, "Interpretation": "ERBB2 (also known as HER2) encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase which is in the same family as EGFR.

Preclinical studies have reported that this mutation also confers reduced sensitivity to lapatinib (Trowe et al., 2008; 18413839, Li et al., 2014; 25238247). ERBB2 T798I retains sensitivity to other irreversible pan_HER inhibitors such as afatinib (Hanker et al., 2017; 28274957) and PD168393 (Li et al., 2014; 25238247). ERBB2 mutation or amplification was observed in 4% and 2_6% of colorectal adenocarcinoma cases, respectively (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Ross et al., 2018; 29338072, Heppner et al., 2014; 25211663, Seo et al., 2014; 24879338). For patients with colorectal cancer, multiple studies have shown that ERBB2 overexpression does not correlate with survival (Wu et al., 2015; 26276145, Seo et al., 2014; 24879338, Sclafani et al., 2013; 24146218) and is not considered prognostic (NCCN Colon Cancer Guidelines, v3.2022, NCCN Rectal Guidelines, v4.2022); however, studies have shown an association of ERBB2 amplification with reduced response and/or shorter survival for patients treated with anti_EGFR antibodies (Martin et al., 2013; 23348520, Sartore_Bianchi et al., 2019; 30952821, Raghav et al., 2019; DOI: 10.1200/PO.18.00226).

The Phase 1 trial of HER2_selective TKI BI_1810631 for patients with HER2_aberration_positive metastatic solid tumors reported a 3.7% ORR (7/19) and an 84% DCR; for patients with NSCLC, a 45% ORR (5/11) and a 91% DCR were reported (Opdam et al., 2022; ENA Abstract 1LBA). It is not known whether these therapeutic approaches would be relevant in the context of alterations that have not been fully characterized, as seen here.

A preclinical study suggests that combined mTOR and MEK inhibition is effective in a model of NF1_deficient malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) (Malone et al., 2014; 24913553). Multiple clinical studies report that inhibitors of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway have not produced significant clinical benefit as monotherapies to treat CRC, even for tumors that harbor alterations in PIK3CA or PTEN; data are more limited for alterations in other genes in this pathway (Ng et al., 2013; 23743569, Ganesan et al., 2013; 24092809, Janku et al., 2014; 24440717).

KDM5A overexpression alters the transcriptional regulation of cell cycle genes, including CCND1, and a variety of cyclin_dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs), including CDKN1A, CDKN1B, and CDKN2A, and results in cell cycle progression (Zeng et al., 2010; 19850045, Teng et al., 2013; 23722541, Liang et al., 2013; 23922798, Jiping et al., 2013; 23794145, Vieira et al., 2014; 24200674, Li et al., 2014; 24716659). Additionally, elevated KDM5A expression and associated chromatin remodeling has been implicated in resistance to various tyrosine kinase inhibitors in vitro, including erlotinib and gefitinib (Sharma et al., 2010; 20371346, Dannenberg et al., 2010; 20371339, Hou et al., 2012; 22937203). KDM5A amplification has been reported with the highest incidence in TCGA datasets in ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (7.2%), testicular germ cell cancer (5.8%), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (4.3%), and lung squamous cell carcinoma (3.9%) (cBioPortal, Jan 2023)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Elevated levels of KDM5A expression have also been reported in a range of solid tumor types (Hou et al., 2012; 22937203, Liang et al., 2013; 23922798, Teng et al., 2013; 23722541, Paolicchi et al., 2013; 23266085, Vieira et al., 2014; 24200674, Li et al., 2014; 24716659), and fusion of KDM5A to NUP98 has been documented in acute myeloid leukemia (van Zutven et al., 2006; 16419055, Wang et al., 2009; 19430464). KDM5A expression is significantly correlated with HIF_1alpha and VEGF expression, as well as tumor size, angiogenesis, and poor patient prognosis in lung cancer (Qi et al., 2014; 25162518). There are no targeted therapies available to directly address genomic alterations in KDM5A. However, multiple preclinical studies have identified potential targets in KDM5A amplified or activated cells that may respond to therapy. KDM5A_mediated chromatin remodeling induces CCND1 expression and represses CDKI expression (Zeng et al., 2010; 19850045, Teng et al., 2013; 23722541, Liang et al., 2013; 23922798, Jiping et al., 2013; 23794145, Vieira et al., 2014; 24200674); therefore, KDM5A activation or amplification may sensitize cells to CDK4/CDK6 inhibitors. Drug_resistant cell populations, characterized by elevated KDM5A expression, responded to histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition (Sharma et al., 2010; 20371346), suggesting that HDAC inhibitors may be a potential therapeutic option. KDM5A also induces expression of VEGF and promotes angiogenesis, oncogenic transformation, and tumorigenesis, which can be inhibited by KDM5A knockdown (Li et al., 2014; 24716659, Qi et al., 2014; 25162518), suggesting that tumors harboring KDM5A amplification may be sensitive to angiogenesis inhibitors, including kinase inhibitors that target the VEGF receptors, such as sunitinib, sorafenib, vandetanib, ponatinib, cabozantinib, regorafenib, pazopanib, and axitinib. However, these inhibitors have yet to be extensively tested in the context of KDM5A amplification or activation; therefore, it is not known if these therapeutic strategies are relevant.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "KRAS", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "wildtype", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "wildtype"}}, "Interpretation": "KRAS encodes a member of the RAS family of small GTPases.

The Phase 3 PARADIGM trial comparing panitumumab plus mFOLFOX6 versus bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6 as first_line treatment for patients with RAS_wildtype left_sided metastatic CRC demonstrated that treatment with panitumumab significantly improved median OS (mOS; 36.2 months vs. 31.3 months) compared with bevacizumab (Yoshino et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract LBA1). A Phase 2 trial reported that, for patients with unresectable RAS_wildtype colorectal adenocarcinoma treated with panitumumab plus FOLFOX4, maintenance with a combination of panitumumab plus fluorouracil and leucovorin was superior to panitumumab monotherapy (10_month PFS OF 59% vs. 49%)(Pietrantonio et al., 2019; 31268481).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS colorectal cancers (CRCs) make up 70_85% of CRC cases (Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894). MSS colorectal cancers are molecularly heterogeneous, driven by diverse mechanisms such as extensive DNA methylation, oncogenic mutations in KRAS or BRAF, or chromosomal instability (Jass, 2007; 17204026). Multiple studies have shown that MSS CRCs have a worse prognosis than MSI_high tumors (Samowitz et al., 2001; 11535541, Elsaleh and Iacopetta, 2001; 12445368, Brueckl et al., 2003; 12820457, Guidoboni et al., 2001; 11438476, Gryfe et al., 2000; 10631274, Sinicrope et al., 2006; 16952542, Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Laghi and Malesci, 2012; 22722556). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60). For patients with chemotherapy_refractory microsatellite_stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), a Phase 3 trial reported no OS advantage from the combination of the PD_L1 inhibitor atezolizumab plus cobimetinib relative to regorafenib (8.9 vs. 8.5 months, HR=1.00); atezolizumab monotherapy similarly did not prolong OS (7.1 vs. 8.5 months, HR=1.19) (Ciardiello et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract LBA_004). For patients with MSS CRC, a Phase 2 study combining ipilimumab and nivolumab reported an overall DCR of 25% (10/40) (Parikh et al., 2021; DOI: 10.1038/s43018_021_00269_7). Two Phase 1 studies for patients with MSS CRC treated with regorafenib and nivolumab reported PFSs of 7.9 months (Fukuoka et al., 2020; 32343640) and 5.7 months (Kim et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1016/j.annonc.2020.04.073), and a patient with MSS CRC refractory to chemotherapy treated with the PD_1 inhibitor sintilimab and regorafenib reported a CR (Zhang et al., 2021; 34688262). MSI has not been found to be a predictive biomarker for combination chemotherapy regimens, including FOLFOX (Sinicrope et al., 2013; 24019539, Gavin et al., 2012; 23045248) and FOLFIRI (Bertagnolli et al., 2009; 19273709, Van Cutsem et al., 2009; 19451425). Patients with MSS CRC are more likely to benefit from postsurgical fluorouracil (FU)_based adjuvant therapy (Ribic et al., 2003; 12867608, Sargent et al., 2010; 20498393) but less likely to benefit from irinotecan chemotherapy (Fallik et al., 2003; 14522894).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "NOTCH3", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "splice site 119_156_197+54>GGGGG", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "11.18", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "splice site 119_156_197+54>GGGGG"}}, "Interpretation": "NOTCH3 encodes a member of the NOTCH family of receptors, which are involved in cell fate determination and various developmental processes. Upon binding of membrane_bound ligands, NOTCH signaling involves cleavage of the NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD), which subsequently forms part of a transcription factor complex that regulates downstream target genes (Penton et al., 2012; 22306179, Kopan and Ilagan, 2009; 19379690). Alterations that disrupt or remove the transmembrane domain (amino acids 1644_1664), RAM domain (amino acids 1665_1837), and/or ANK repeats region (amino acids 1838_2000), which are necessary for the transcriptional activity of NOTCH family proteins, as well as internal deletions that remove EGF repeats (7_10 and 21_22), have been shown in vitro to negatively affect ligand binding and reduce NOTCH3 transcriptional activity and are predicted to be inactivating (Kopan and Ilagan, 2009; 19379690, Deregowski et al., 2006; 16869730, Be\u00e0 et al., 2013; 24145436, McDaniell et al., 2006; 16773578, Lin et al., 2010; 20068176). NOTCH3 mutations have been reported in 6% of colorectal adenocarcinomas (CRC), whereas NOTCH3 amplification was reported in 1% of cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696). NOTCH3 rearrangements were reported in <0.1% of colorectal cancers (Nguyen et al., 2022; 35120664). NOTCH3 activation has been reported to be frequent in CRC, with mRNA and/or protein overexpression reported in 19.7_38% of samples (Serafin et al., 2011; 21598247, Ozawa et al., 2014; 24728738, Furukawa et al., 2011; 24244701). NOTCH3 expression is more frequent in aggressive colorectal micropapillary carcinoma (35/51, 69%) than in microsatellite_stable CRC (42/97, 43%) cases (P=0.005)(Lee et al., 2013; 23060121). Nuclear (activated) NOTCH3 expression has been associated with advanced disease and tumor recurrence in patients with Stage 2 and 3 colorectal cancer (Ozawa et al., 2014; 24728738). Several approaches for inhibiting NOTCH3 signaling are being developed, including neutralizing NOTCH antibodies such as tarextumab (OMP_59R5) (Yen et al., 2015; 25934888), which targets NOTCH2 and NOTCH3, and pan_NOTCH inhibitors, such as gamma_secretase inhibitors (GSI) (Hu et al., 2014; 24743243, Konishi et al., 2007; 17804716, Xiao et al., 2011; 20838375). In a Phase 2 study, the GSI AL101 (BMS_906024) elicited PR in 15% (6/39) and SD in 54% (21/39) of patients with metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma harboring NOTCH activating alterations (Ferrarotto et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 919MO). Phase 2 studies have evaluated the efficacy of tarextumab in combination with chemotherapy in metastatic pancreatic cancer or extensive_stage small cell lung cancer, though NOTCH3 expression was not found to be a predictor of OS or PFS in either study (Hu et al., 2019; 31347292; O\u2019Reilly et al., 2015; Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium Abstract 278, Daniel et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 1530PD).

No alterations in NRAS were identified in this case. The majority of colorectal cancers (CRCs) (91_98%) have been reported to lack NRAS mutations (Pentheroudakis et al., 2013; 23374602, Vaughn et al., 2011; 21305640, Janku et al., 2013; 23400451, De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739, Irahara et al., 2010; 20736745, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Schirripa et al., 2015; 24806288, Guo et al., 2018; 29666387).

Clinical studies have reported associations of SMAD4 loss or low SMAD4 expression with improved responses to chemotherapeutic agents in patients with pancreatic cancer (Ormanns et al., 2017; 28534865, Fei et al., 2021; 34002944, Bachet et al., 2012; 22377565) and non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Ziemke et al., 2017; 28577946). Other clinical studies in pancreatic cancer have reported an association of high SMAD4 expression with better responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Kassardjian and Wang, 2020; 32897998) and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (Pen et al., 2021; 33667587). Germline SMAD4 mutations, including those at the R361 hotspot, have been observed in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome (Houlston et al., 1998; 9811934, Woodford_Richens et al., 2000; 10764709, Howe et al., 2004; 15235019, Howe et al., 2004; 15235019, Howe et al., 2004; 15235019), which is associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal cancers (Brosens et al., 2011; 22171123). The penetrance of deleterious SMAD4 mutations in patients with colon cancer is estimated at 20% by age 35 and 70% by age 65 (Kalia et al., 2017; 27854360). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of SMAD4 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "P151R", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "67.35", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "P151R"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 mutations have been reported in up to 75% of colorectal cancer cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Goh et al., 1995; 7585578, Berg et al., 2010; 21103049, Han et al., 2013; 23700467, Peeters et al., 2013; 23325582, Malhotra et al., 2013; 23526092, Di Bartolomeo et al., 2013; 23821376, Fong et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 57). A study reported p53 expression in 49% of analyzed colorectal cancer cases (Wangefjord et al., 2013; 23337059). TP53 mutation has not been consistently demonstrated to be a significant independent prognostic marker in the context of CRC (Russo et al., 2005; 16172461, Fong et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 57). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "01", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "01"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Fabrizio et al., 2018; 30151257, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526). Elevated tumor mutational burden (TMB) has been reported in 8_25% of colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (George et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3587, Nagahashi et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e15103, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117, Shao et al., 2020; 33119110). Multiple studies have reported that up to 90% of hypermutated CRC cases exhibit high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI_H) and mismatch repair deficiency (MMR_D) (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). Increased TMB is significantly associated with MSI_H and MMR_D, with studies reporting that 100% of MSI_H CRCs harbor elevated TMB and conversely that 100% of tumors with low TMB harbor intact MMR (George et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3587, Nagahashi et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e15103, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). A subset of CRCs that harbor increased TMB but not MSI_H are driven by mutations in POLE, which leads to an \u201cultramutated\u201d phenotype with especially high TMB (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). Tumors with increased TMB harbor BRAF V600E mutations more frequently than those with low TMB (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117), whereas TMB_low tumors more frequently harbor mutations in TP53 and APC (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696). The prognostic value of tumor mutational burden (TMB) in colorectal cancer (CRC) is context_ and therapy_dependent. A study of tissue TMB (tTMB) in 145 CRC samples showed longer OS in TMB_high samples compared with TMB_low ones (Schwartz et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 572). Similarly, for patients with metastatic CRC treated with first_line chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab or cetuximab, high tissue TMB (tTMB_H) was associated with longer OS (Innocenti et al., 2019; 30865548). For patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, tTMB_H was associated with better 5_year relapse_free survival (Lee et al., 2019; 31285374). However, for patients with EGFR/BRAF_inhibitor_treated, BRAF_mutated microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic CRC, intermediate tTMB was associated with significantly poorer PFS and OS compared with TMB_low status; patients with primary resistance to EGFR/BRAF blockage had higher TMB than those sensitive to these therapies (Randon et al., 2022; 34933155). In a study for 61 patients with metastatic, MSS CRC treated with best standard of care, plasma TMB scores \u226528 Muts/Mb (approximately 14 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) were associated with reduced OS compared with plasma TMB scores <28 Muts/Mb (3.0 vs. 5.3 months, HR=0.76, p=0.007), whereas tTMB was not found to be prognostic in this population (Chen et al., 2020; 32379280, Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, increased tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Ott et al., 2019; 30557521, Cristescu et al., 2022; 35101941, Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). In the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors, significant improvement in ORR was observed for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) compared with those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526); similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). At the same TMB cutpoint, retrospective analysis of patients with solid tumors treated with any checkpoint inhibitor identified that tissue TMB scores \u2265 10 Muts/Mb were associated with prolonged time to treatment failure compared with scores <10 muts/Mb (HR=0.68) (Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). For patients with solid tumors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the CheckMate 848 trial, improved responses were observed in patients with a tissue TMB \u2265 10 Muts/Mb independent of blood TMB at any cutpoint in matched samples (Schenker at al., 2022; AACR Abstract 7845). However, support for higher TMB thresholds and efficacy was observed in the prospective Phase 2 MyPathway trial of atezolizumab for patients with pan_solid tumors, where improved ORR and DCR was seen in patients with TMB \u2265 16 Muts/Mb than those with TMB \u2265 10 and <16 Muts/Mb (Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409). Similarly, analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386). In CRC specifically, a retrospective analysis of immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy reported significantly improved OS for patients with tumors harboring TMB \u22659.8 Muts/MB compared with those with tumors with TMB <9.8 Muts/Mb (~ equivalency <12 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254). Another retrospective study reported that a TMB \u226512 Muts/Mb cutoff identifies >99% of MSI_High CRC cases but only 3% of MSS cases, indicating the utility of this cutoff for identification of patients with CRC likely to benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Fabrizio et al., 2018; 30151257).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null,
