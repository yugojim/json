In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations, such as seen here, have been shown to activate the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR and to confer sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib, gefitinib (Lynch et al., 2004; 15118073, Paez et al., 2004; 15118125, Pao et al., 2004; 15329413), afatinib (Yang et al., 2015; 25589191), osimertinib (Soria et al., 2018; 29151359), and dacomitinib (Wu et al., 2017; 28958502, Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), although limited preclinical data suggest reduced sensitivity to lapatinib (Gilmer et al., 2008; 18199554, Foster et al., 2016; 26996308). EGFR mutation has been reported in 12_36% of lung adenocarcinomas (Vallee et al., 2013; 23934203, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552) and in 4% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745). EGFR protein expression/overexpression has been reported in up to 70% of NSCLC cases (Watzka et al., 2010; 20353893, Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Grob et al., 2013; 23238037, Park et al., 2012; 22207554, Dobashi et al., 2011; 21040950, Ludovini et al., 2013; 23314677). In addition, expression of EGFR protein has been shown to be higher in lung squamous cell carcinoma samples as compared to lung adenocarcinoma (Skrzypski et al., 2013; 23870818, Kim et al., 2012; 22419022). In the context of metastatic non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), patients with EGFR sensitizing mutations and concurrent alterations in both RB1 and TP53 (triple_mutant), as seen here, may be at significantly higher risk of transformation to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), a mechanism of resistance to treatment with EGFR inhibitors; median time from advanced NSCLC diagnosis to SCLC transformation has been reported to be 17.8 months (Marcoux et al., 2019; 30550363, Lee et al., 2017; 28498782, Offin et al., 2019; 31228622). A retrospective study reported SCLC transformation in 18% (7/39) of patients with triple_mutant NSCLC and a shorter time to initial EGFR inhibitor discontinuation in these patients (9.5 months) compared to that in patients with EGFR/TP53_mutant NSCLC (12.3 months) or in patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations only (36.6 months) (Offin et al., 2019; 31228622). In patients with lung adenocarcinoma, EGFR mutation was a predictor of poor overall survival (Lee et al., 2013; 23525704, Oakley and Chiosea, 2011; 21587084). However, EGFR mutations have been reported to predict improved survival in patients with resected Stage 1_3 lung adenocarcinoma (Marks et al., 2008; 18303429) or resected Stage 1 NSCLC (Izar et al., 2013; 23932319). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer, EGFR activating mutations may predict sensitivity to EGFR TKIs, including erlotinib (Rosell et al., 2011; 22285168), gefitinib (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064), afatinib (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960), dacomitinib (Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), and osimertinib (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549); however, the data for patients with other tumor types are limited (Hong et al., 2020; 32749686, Kim et al., 2015; 26462025, Kim et al., 2015; 25424851, Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840, Cavalieri et al., 2018; 29734047, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Audet et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 6041). The Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study of amivantamab monotherapy or in combination with lazertinib for the treatment of EGFR_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has produced encouraging preliminary results for treatment_naive patients and patients who relapsed after treatment with osimertinib, including osimertinib_relapsed patients with biomarkers indicating EGFR/MET_based osimertinib resistance (Haura et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9009, Cho et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 1258O, Bauml et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9006). In a Phase 1 trial, the HER3_targeted antibody patritumab deruxtecan elicited an ORR of 39% (22/57, 1 CR) and a median PFS of 8.2 months for patients with non_small cell lung cancer previously treated with an EGFR TKI, many of whom displayed TKI resistance alterations (Janne et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9007). A Phase 1 trial evaluating the EGFR inhibitor AZD3759 reported a reduction in the volume of brain metastases in 40% (8/20) of patients with previously treated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring either the EGFR L858R alteration or EGFR exon 19 deletion, including 3 confirmed PRs and 3 unconfirmed PRs (Ahn et al., 2017; 29056570, Yang et al., 2016; 27928026). In a Phase 1/2 trial for advanced NSCLC, the brain_penetrant third_generation EGFR TKI lazertinib enabled ORRs of 54% (69/127) for all evaluable patients and 44% (8/18, intracranial) for patients with brain metastases (Ahn et al., 2019; 31587882). The Phase 3 IMpower150 study showed that the addition of atezolizumab to bevacizumab plus chemotherapy treatment also had clinical efficacy for patients with EGFR_mutated or ALK_rearranged metastatic NSCLC (Socinski et al., 2018; 29863955); therefore, the patient\u2019s clinical context should be considered. Acquired RET rearrangements have been detected in 2 patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC who had progressed on first_line EGFR inhibitors, suggesting that RET activation may mediate bypass resistance to EGFR_targeted therapy in lung cancer (Klempner et al., 2015; 26187428). Case series have reported RET rearrangements for patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC who progressed on osimertinib, including 7 patients with acquired resistance (Offin et al., 2018; 30957057, Piotrowska et al., 2018; 30257958, Lu et al., 2019; DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2019.37.15_suppl.e20626, Papadimitrakopoulou et al., 2018; doi:10.1093/annonc/mdy424, Rich et al., 2019; 31300450, Chae et al., 2019; doi.org/10.1200/PO.18.00295, Oxnard et al., 2018; 30073261). Patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC harboring RET rearrangements experienced significantly shorter OS in response to first_line treatment with osimertinib (22.9 vs 59.5 months, p=0.021) and after progressing with osimertinib (2.1 vs 10.0 months, p=0.031) compared with non_RET_rearranged cases (Lu et al., 2019; DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2019.37.15_suppl.e20626). Preclinical studies reported that EGFR_mutated lung cell lines expressing CCDC6\u2013RET rearrangement showed limited response to osimertinib in vitro compared with EGFR_mutated parental cells (Piotrowska et al., 2018; 30257958).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

Gefitinib achieved an ORR of 69.8% and an OS of 19.2 months as first_line treatment for Caucasian patients with non_small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and EGFR sensitizing mutations (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064). In the retrospective analysis of a Phase 3 study for East Asian patients, gefitinib was reported to have a longer PFS for patients with EGFR mutation_positive NSCLC compared with carboplatin/paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy (Fukuoka et al., 2011; 21670455, Mok et al., 2009; 19692680). Two Phase 3 trials of gefitinib plus pemetrexed and carboplatin compared with gefitinib alone for patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR activating mutations reported significantly higher ORRs (75.3% and 84% vs. 62.5% and 67%), longer median PFSs (16 and 20.9 months vs. 8 and 11.9 months), and longer median OSs (50.9 months and not reached vs. 17 and 38.8 months) with combination treatment; however, combination treatment was associated with increased Grade 3 or higher adverse events (Noronha et al., 2019; 31411950, Hosomi et al., 2020; 31682542). Retrospective analysis of East Asian patients with advanced NSCLC receiving first_line gefitinib therapy reported that patients with EGFR exon 19 mutations experienced a longer median PFS (10.9 months) compared with patients with EGFR mutations in exon 18 (7.9 months), exon 20 (1.2 months), exon 21 (7.7 months), or double mutations (5.7 months); however, no differences in OS were seen between EGFR mutations (Sutiman et al., 2017; 27908825). In a Phase 1 study for treatment_naive patients with NSCLC, best ORRs of 78% (7/9) were observed in patients treated with combination gefitinib and the PD_L1 inhibitor durvalumab as first_line treatment and of 80% (8/10) in those treated with the combination after gefitinib monotherapy (Gibbons et al., 2016; 27198414). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Osimertinib", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Osimertinib is an irreversible EGFR TKI that is selective for EGFR TKI_sensitizing mutations and the EGFR T790M mutation.

On the basis of clinical evidence for patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC, RET rearrangements have been associated with resistance to osimertinib (Offin et al., 2018; 30957057, Piotrowska et al., 2018; 30257958, Lu et al., 2019; DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2019.37.15_suppl.e20626, Papadimitrakopoulou et al., 2018; doi:10.1093/annonc/mdy424, Rich et al., 2019; 31300450, Chae et al., 2019; doi.org/10.1200/PO.18.00295, Oxnard et al., 2018; 30073261). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> A patient with 2 primary NSCLC tumors, 1 harboring EGFR L858R and one with KIF5B_RET fusion, initially treated with osimertinib, achieved durable disease control in response to treatment with a combination of alectinib and osimertinib (Aredo et al., 2020; 33451914). In a retrospective study of selpercatinib in combination with osimertinib for patients with EGFR_mutant non_small cell lung cancer with acquired RET fusions who progressed after osimertinib, 50% (5/10) of the patients achieved PRs (4 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed), with median treatment duration of 11 months (Rotow et al., 2020; IASLC WCLC Abstract FP14.07). The Phase 3 FLAURA study reported that, relative to erlotinib or gefitinib, first_line osimertinib significantly increased both median PFS (18.9 vs. 10.2 months, HR=0.46) and median OS (38.6 vs. 31.8 months; HR=0.80) for patients with advanced NSCLC and activating, sensitizing EGFR mutations (specifically, exon 19 deletion or L858) (Soria et al., 2018; 29151359, Ramalingam et al., 2019; 31751012).

For patients with erlotinib_ or gefitinib_resistant NSCLC and EGFR mutations, Phase 2/3 studies of afatinib treatment have generally reported ORRs of only 7 to 9% (Miller et al., 2012; 22452896, Chen et al., 2013; 23664448, Katakami et al., 2013; 23816963, Landi et al., 2014; 25242668, De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2015; 25682316, Yang et al., 2015; 26051236); however, DCRs of more than 50% have been observed (De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2015; 25682316). In a Phase 1b or observational study, patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC who progressed on afatinib experienced further clinical benefit from subsequent treatment with afatinib and cetuximab (Horn et al., 2017; 29110849) or osimertinib (Yamamoto et al., 2020; 31863283), respectively. Extensive clinical data have demonstrated that afatinib is effective for patients with EGFR_mutated advanced NSCLC, including exon 19 deletions and L858 mutations, as well as uncommon sensitizing mutations in exons 18 or 20 (Januszewski et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.13_17, Chang et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_11, Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960, Wu et al., 2014; 24439929, Yang et al., 2015; 25589191, Soria et al., 2015; 26156651, Paz_Ares et al., 2017; 28426106). Afatinib has also shown activity for patients with advanced NSCLC and ERBB2 mutations, most of which were exon 20 insertions (Dziadziuszko et al., 2019; 30825613, Lai et al., 2019; 30685684, Greulich et al., 2012; 22908275, Gow et al., 2015; 26134234, Mazi\u00e8res et al., 2016; 26598547, Mazi\u00e8res et al., 2013; 23610105, De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2015; 25682316, De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2012; 22325357, Li et al., 2015; 26559459, Costa et al., 2016; 26964772, Yuan et al., 2020; 32477948, Fang et al., 2019; 31748336). The randomized Phase 3 LUX_Lung 8 trial comparing afatinib with erlotinib as second_line therapy for advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) reported significantly longer median OS (7.9 vs. 6.8 months, HR=0.81), significantly longer median PFS (2.6 vs. 1.9 months, HR=0.81), and higher DCR (51% vs. 40%, p=0.002) for patients treated with afatinib (Soria et al., 2015; 26156651). For patients who progressed on afatinib monotherapy, additional clinical benefit has been reported from afatinib combined with paclitaxel (Schuler et al., 2016; 26646759). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Erlotinib", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Erlotinib is a small_molecule inhibitor of EGFR.

A Phase 3 study reported similar efficacy of erlotinib and gefitinib for patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC (Yang et al., 2017; 28103612). Meta_analysis of studies comparing erlotinib or gefitinib versus chemotherapy in the first_line setting reported no significant improvement in OS for patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC; however, the lack of improved OS was attributed to the effectiveness of postprogression salvage therapy (Lee et al., 2017; 28376144). In the maintenance setting, the placebo_controlled Phase 3 SATURN trial reported significantly improved PFS with maintenance erlotinib following first_line platinum_based chemotherapy irrespective of EGFR status; however, the largest effect was seen for patients with EGFR mutations (HR=0.10)(Cappuzzo et al., 2010; 20493771). In the neoadjuvant setting, a Phase 2 trial reported a numerically improved ORR and significantly longer PFS with erlotinib compared with chemotherapy for patients with advanced EGFR_mutated NSCLC (Zhong et al., 2019; 31194613). In the placebo_controlled Phase 3 RELAY trial, the addition of ramucirumab to erlotinib improved PFS for previously untreated patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR L858R or exon 19 deletion (19.4 vs. 12.4 months, HR=0.59)(Nakagawa et al., 2019; 31591063). In a Phase 2 trial, no clinical benefit was observed from the addition of bevacizumab to erlotinib for patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation (Stinchcombe et al., 2019; 31393548). In one study, median PFS (4.1 vs. 11.7 months, HR=9.7) and median OS (14.1 vs. 47.0 months, HR=10.2) were significantly shorter for patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR L747_A750>P (n=6) relative to those with deletions affecting EGFR E746_A750 (n=24) treated with first_line erlotinib (Truini et al., 2019; 31182434).

A pooled subgroup analysis of patients with NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations reported improved clinical efficacy with dacomitinib treatment compared with erlotinib (median PFS, 14.6 vs, 9.6 months, HR=0.717; median OS, 26.6 vs, 23.2 months, HR=0.737)(Ramalingam et al., 2016; 26768165). Reduced efficacy of dacomitinib treatment in patients with NSCLC harboring the EGFR T790M mutation has been reported in multiple studies (Yu et al., 2017; 29191595, Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009, Janne et al., 2011; 21220471).

It has been identified as a proto_oncogene that results in transformation of cells upon recombination with a partner gene (Takahashi et al., 1985; 2992805). RET fusions involving an N_terminal partner gene that is predicted to promote dimerization and the kinase domain of RET (exons 12_18)(Shaw et al., 2013; 24132104) have been characterized as activating and oncogenic (Ju et al., 2012; 22194472, Belli et al., 2020; 32665298, Powell et al., 1998; 9850089, Jhiang, 2000; 11114739, Matsubara et al., 2012; 23154560, Takeuchi et al., 2012; 22327623, Fusco et al., 1987; 3600795, Lipson et al., 2012; 22327622, Kohno et al., 2012; 22327624, Chang et al., 2017; 27873490, Das et al., 2017; 28877471). Certain other RET rearrangements may retain capacity to dimerize through self_association of the RET transmembrane domain and have been shown to be mildly transforming (Takahashi et al., 1988; 3078962, Kjaer et al., 2006; 16732321). RET fusions have been shown to be clinically sensitive to RET targeted therapies (Drilon et al., 2019; WCLC Abstract PL02.08, Gainor et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 9515) (Wirth et al., 2020; 32846061, Gautschi et al., 2017; 28447912, Belli et al., 2020; 32665298, Drilon et al., 2013; 23533264, Wang et al., 2016; 27334835, Li et al., 2016; 28011461). Rearrangements, such as observed here, are predicted to be activating and oncogenic. In the TCGA dataset, RET rearrangements were observed in fewer than 1% of lung adenocarcinoma cases (Stransky et al., 2014; 25204415, Yoshihara et al., 2014; 25500544). Other studies have identified RET rearrangement in 1_2% of cases (Pan et al., 2014; 24629636, Kohno et al., 2012; 22327624, Wang et al., 2012; 23150706, Drilon et al., 2013; 23533264), and at an incidence of 6% in non_small cell lung cancers lacking other known driver mutations (Drilon et al., 2013; 23533264). Multiple activating RET fusions with distinct fusion partners have been described in the context of cancer (Stransky et al., 2014; 25204415, Yoshihara et al., 2014; 25500544), with the KIF5B_RET and CCDC6_RET fusions being the most common variants detected in lung adenocarcinoma (Wang et al., 2012; 23150706, Ju et al., 2012; 22194472, Lipson et al., 2012; 22327622, Takeuchi et al., 2012; 22327623, Kohno et al., 2012; 22327624). Multiple studies have suggested that RET fusion in lung cancer correlates with adenocarcinoma histology, younger age, never smoke status and advanced disease (Wang et al., 2012; 23150706, Tsuta et al., 2014; 24504365, Gautschi et al., 2017; 28447912). On the basis of clinical evidence, RET activating alterations may predict response to selective RET inhibitors such as pralsetinib (Gainor et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 9515, Subbiah et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 109, Hu et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 1913O), selpercatinib (Drilon et al., 2019; WCLC Abstract PL02.08, Wirth et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA93), and BOS172738 (Schoffski et al., 2021; Abstract 3008), as well as the multikinase inhibitors cabozantinib (Chen et al., 2021; 33869783, Drilon et al., 2016; 27825636, Drilon et al., 2013; 23533264, Gautschi et al., 2017; 28447912, Mukhopadhyay et al., 2014; 25436805, Nokihara et al., 2019; 30718102, Zhang et al., 2021; WCLC Abstract P87.03, Xu et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 415P, Fei et al., 2018; IASLC Abstract P081, Xing et al., 2020; doi: 10.21037/tcr_20_754, Overbeck and Schildhaus, 2017; IASLC Abstract P3.02c_017, Wang et al., 2019; 30653139, Sarfaty et al., 2017; 28082048, Zheng et al., 2020; 32718536, Nokihara et al., 2013; JSMO Abstract O2_026, Chae et al., 2019; 32914006, Abbar et al., 2019; 31668323, Drilon et al., 2015; 25567908, Wang et al., 2016; 27334835, Ross et al., 2017; 28961851, Elisei et al., 2013; 24002501, Michels et al., 2016; 26762747, Sherman et al., 2016; 27525386), lenvatinib (Li et al., 2019; ATA Abstract 291, Gautschi et al., 2017; 28447912, Hida et al., 2019; 31710864, Yao et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract e20634, Chu et al., 2020; 32737449, Velcheti et al., 2016; ESMO Abstract 1204PD, Schlumberger et al., 2016; 26311725), sorafenib (Jones et al., 2010; 20696054, Gautschi et al., 2017; 28447912, Horiike et al., 2016; 26898613, Chen et al., 2011; 21186953, Ballerini et al., 2012; 22513837), sunitinib (Wu et al., 2015; 26291023, Gautschi et al., 2017; 28447912, Lee et al., 2015; AACR Abstract 2416), and vandetanib (Moore et al., 2020; 31762146, Gautschi et al., 2017; 28447912, Yoh et al., 2021; 33725547, Lee et al., 2020; 32083304, Lee et al., 2017; 27803005, Platt et al., 2015; 25881079, Gautschi et al., 2013; 23584301, Drilon et al., 2018; 30017832, Dagogo_Jack et al., 2018; 30368414, Loh et al., 2019; 31808254, Falchook et al., 2016; 25366691, Varella_Garcia et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 8024, Davis et al., 2020; 31994201, Cohen, 2015; 26693082, Subbiah et al., 2015; 25982012, Wells et al., 2012; 22025146, Yoh et al., 2017; 27825616). In a Phase 1/1b study for advanced solid tumors, agerafenib (RXDX_105) led to a preliminary ORR of 44% (4/9; 1 CR in colorectal cancer, 3 PRs in non_small cell lung cancer [NSCLC]) for patients with RET_inhibitor_naive, RET_fusion_positive cancer (Drilon et al., 2016; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 437). A Phase 1 study of the selective RET inhibitor BOS172738 reported an ORR of 33% (10/30) across all dose levels for patients with RET_fusion_positive advanced NSCLC (Schoffski et al., 2021; Abstract 3008). On the basis of limited clinical evidence, RET rearrangements may predict sensitivity to pralsetinib for patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), pancreatic adenocarcinoma, or cholangiocarcinoma ( Subbiah et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 467). RET rearrangements may also predict sensitivity to sorafenib for patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia or PTC (Ballerini et al., 2012; 22513837, Chen et al., 2011; 21186953). Three patients with RET_rearranged non_small cell lung cancer who had been previously treated with at least one line of chemotherapy achieved SD following treatment with sorafenib (Gautschi et al., 2017; 28447912, Horiike et al., 2016; 26898613). Preclinical studies have presented conflicting data regarding the sensitivity of RET fusions to sorafenib (Chang et al., 2017; 27873490, Das et al., 2017; 28877471, Henderson et al., 2008; 18676765, Kim et al., 2018; 30210625, Lipson et al., 2012; 22327622, Suzuki et al., 2013; 23578175). In a Phase 1b study, RET_inhibitor_naive patients with NSCLC were reported to achieve an ORR of 19% (6/31) in response to agerafenib; of note, the ORR was 0% (0/20) for cases harboring the KIF5B_RET fusion compared with 67% (6/9) for non_KIF5B_RET fusions (Drilon et al., 2019; 30487236). Phase 1 studies of alectinib for the treatment of patients with RET_rearranged NSCLC have reported limited efficacy with an ORR of 3% (1/33 PR) (Peled et al., 2020: WCLC Abstract P87.01, Takeuchi et al., 2021; 33569315), while case studies have collectively reported 2 PRs in response to higher dose alectinib (and 1 unconfirmed PR) out of 11 patients (Ribeiro et al., 2020; 31698333, Lin et al., 2016; 27544060, Gautschi et al., 2017; 28447912, Velcheti et al., 2017; 28629549, Subbiah et al., 2018; 29912274, Wirth et al., 2019; 32923848). While preclinical data have shown sensitivity, including with gatekeeper V804L/M mutations (Gozgit et al., 2018; 30038711, Mologni et al., 2013; 23811235), ponatinib has shown limited efficacy in patients with RET_rearranged NSCLC (2/2 SD) (Gautschi et al., 2017; 28447912). Acquired RET rearrangements have been detected in 2 patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC who had progressed on first_line EGFR inhibitors, suggesting that RET activation may mediate bypass resistance to EGFR_targeted therapy in lung cancer (Klempner et al., 2015; 26187428). Case series have reported RET rearrangements for patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC who progressed on osimertinib, including 7 patients with acquired resistance (Offin et al., 2018; 30957057, Piotrowska et al., 2018; 30257958, Lu et al., 2019; DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2019.37.15_suppl.e20626, Papadimitrakopoulou et al., 2018; doi:10.1093/annonc/mdy424, Rich et al., 2019; 31300450, Chae et al., 2019; doi.org/10.1200/PO.18.00295, Oxnard et al., 2018; 30073261). Patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC harboring RET rearrangements experienced significantly shorter OS in response to first_line treatment with osimertinib (22.9 vs 59.5 months, p=0.021) and after progressing with osimertinib (2.1 vs 10.0 months, p=0.031) compared with non_RET_rearranged cases (Lu et al., 2019; DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2019.37.15_suppl.e20626). Preclinical studies reported that EGFR_mutated lung cell lines expressing CCDC6\u2013RET rearrangement showed limited response to osimertinib in vitro compared with EGFR_mutated parental cells (Piotrowska et al., 2018; 30257958).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "RET amplification, activating mutations, or activating fusions may confer sensitivity to kinase inhibitors targeting RET.

The two most frequently reported MUTYH loss of function mutations are G382D (also referred to as G396D) and Y165C (also referred to as Y179C) (Molatore et al., 2010; 19953527, Kundu et al., 2009; 19836313, D Agostino et al., 2010; 20418187, Hegde et al., 2014; 24310308, Aretz et al., 2013; 22872101). Numerous other MUTYH mutations have also been shown to result in loss of function (Molatore et al., 2010; 19953527, Kundu et al., 2009; 19836313, Ali et al., 2008; 18534194, D Agostino et al., 2010; 20418187). In general, somatic MUTYH mutations are infrequently reported across cancer types (COSMIC, 2021)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Monoallelic MUTYH mutation occurs in 1_2% of the general population (Hegde et al., 2014; 24310308, Aretz et al., 2013; 22872101). There is conflicting data regarding the impact of monoallelic mutations on the risk of developing CRC (Win et al., 2014; 24444654, Lubbe et al., 2009; 19620482, Jones et al., 2009; 19394335). Patients with MUTYH_mutant CRC were reported to have significantly improved overall survival compared to patients without MUTYH mutation (Nielsen et al., 2010; 21044966). There are no therapies or clinical trials available to address MUTYH alterations in cancer. One or more of the MUTYH variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with MUTYH_associated polyposis (ClinVar, Mar 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline biallelic MUTYH mutation causes MUTYH_associated polyposis (also known as MYH_associated polyposis or MAP), an autosomal recessive condition characterized by multiple colorectal adenomas and increased lifetime risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) (Hegde et al., 2014; 24310308, Sampson et al., 2003; 12853198, Sieber et al., 2003; 12606733, Al_Tassan et al., 2002; 11818965). MAP accounts for approximately 0.7% of all CRC cases and 2% of early_onset CRC cases (Hegde et al., 2014; 24310308). In contrast to CRC, the role of MUTYH mutation in the context of other cancer types is not well established (Rennert et al., 2012; 21952991, Zhang et al., 2006; 16492928, von der Th\u00fcsen et al., 2011; 21189386, Casper et al., 2014; 24420788, Smith et al., 2009; 20110747). Estimates for the prevalence of MAP in the general population range from 1:5,000_1:10,000 (Aretz et al., 2013; 22872101).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942).

MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI_H is generally infrequent in NSCLC, reported in fewer than 1% of samples across several large studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197, Ninomiya et al., 2006; 16641899, Vanderwalde et al., 2018; 29436178, Zang et al., 2019; 31270941, Dudley et al., 2016; 26880610, Takamochi et al., 2017; 28676214, Schrock et al., 2017; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2016.11.487), whereas data on the reported incidence of MSI_H in SCLC has been limited and conflicting (Pylkkanen et al., 1997; 9329646, Gonzalez et al., 2000; 11061602, Chen et al., 1996; 8782463, Merlo et al., 1994; 8174113). One study reported MSI_H in lung adenocarcinoma patients with smoking history, and 3 of 4 MSI_H patients examined also had metachronous carcinomas in other organs, although this has not been investigated in large scale studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of MSI in NSCLC are limited (PubMed, Oct 2021). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "RB1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "splice site 1215+1G>A", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "splice site 1215+1G>A"}}, "Interpretation": "RB1 encodes the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), a tumor suppressor and negative regulator of the cell cycle (Burkhart and Sage, 2008; 18650841, Knudsen and Knudsen, 2008; 19143056). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt RB1 function or expression (Berge et al., 2010; 20594292, Giacinti et al., 2006; 16936740, Otterson et al., 1997; 9342358, Otterson et al., 1999; 10486322, Qin et al., 1992; 1534305, Rubin et al., 2005; 16360038, Sun et al., 2006; 16449662). In the TCGA dataset, RB1 mutation was observed in 5% of lung squamous cell carcinoma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745) and 4% of lung adenocarcinoma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552). Loss of Rb protein expression has been reported in 62% of pre_chemotherapy advanced non_small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) (Ludovini et al., 2004; 15364135). One study found that RB1 expression was correlated with poor prognosis for patients with NSCLC (Zhao et al., 2012; 22619677). In the context of metastatic non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), patients with EGFR sensitizing mutations and concurrent alterations in both RB1 and TP53 (triple_mutant), as seen here, may be at significantly higher risk of transformation to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), a mechanism of resistance to treatment with EGFR inhibitors; median time from advanced NSCLC diagnosis to SCLC transformation has been reported to be 17.8 months (Marcoux et al., 2019; 30550363, Lee et al., 2017; 28498782, Offin et al., 2019; 31228622). A retrospective study reported SCLC transformation in 18% (7/39) of patients with triple_mutant NSCLC and a shorter time to initial EGFR inhibitor discontinuation in these patients (9.5 months) compared to that in patients with EGFR/TP53_mutant NSCLC (12.3 months) or in patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations only (36.6 months) (Offin et al., 2019; 31228622). On the basis of limited clinical data (Owonikoko et al., 2016; ESMO Abstract 14230) and strong preclinical data (Hook et al., 2012; 22222631, Gong et al., 2018; 30373917, Oser et al., 2018; 30373918), RB1 inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to inhibitors of Aurora kinase A, particularly in small cell lung cancer. It should be noted that a trial of the Aurora kinase A inhibitor alisertib in advanced prostate cancer did not find an association between RB1 deletion and clinical benefit (Beltran et al., 2019; 30232224). Other approaches to target RB1 inactivation under investigation in preclinical studies include inhibitors of BCL_2 family members (Allaman_Pillet et al., 2013; 21955141) and activation of the NOTCH pathway (Viatour et al., 2011; 21875955). Rb inactivation may predict resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors such as palbociclib, abemaciclib, and ribociclib, which act upstream of Rb (Condorelli et al., 2018; 29236940, Fry et al., 2004; 15542782, Dean et al., 2010; 20473330, Dean et al., 2012; 22767154, Garnett et al., 2012; 22460902, Roberts et al., 2012; 22302033, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27217383, O\u2019Leary et al., 2018; 30206110, Costa et al., 2020; 31594766, Chen et al., 2018; 29059158). Loss of Rb function has been associated with increased sensitivity to cytotoxic agents and chemotherapeutics in both preclinical studies and in patients with bladder or breast cancer (Derenzini et al., 2008; 18381962, Knudsen and Knudsen, 2008; 19143056). One or more of the RB1 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with retinoblastoma (ClinVar, Mar 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Mutations in RB1 underlie the development of retinoblastoma (RB), a rare tumor that arises at a rate of approximately 1:20,000 live births, with nearly 5,000 new cases worldwide per year (Chen et al., 2014; 24282159). Germline mutations in RB1 account for approximately 40% of RB tumors (Yun et al., 2011; 22553621) and are associated with an increased risk of developing secondary malignancies that include soft tissue and bone sarcoma and malignant melanoma (Houston et al., 2011; 21139478, Ng et al., 2010; 19959033). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of RB1 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Y205C", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Y205C"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 is one of the most commonly mutated genes in lung cancer; mutations have been reported in 43_80% of non_small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745, Mogi and Kuwano, 2011; 21331359, Tekpli et al., 2013; 23011884, Vignot et al., 2013; 23630207, Maeng et al., 2013; 24222160, Cortot et al., 2014; 24169260, Itakura et al., 2013; 23922113), including 42_52% of lung adenocarcinomas and 58_83% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (cBioPortal, COSMIC, Feb 2021)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, cBio_Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745, Kim et al., 2014; 24323028). TP53 homozygous deletion has been observed in 1.4% of lung adenocarcinoma and <1% of lung squamous cell carcinoma cases (cBioPortal, Feb 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). In one study of 55 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, TP53 alterations correlated with immunogenic features including PD_L1 expression, tumor mutation burden and neoantigen presentation; likely as a consequence of this association TP53 mutations correlated with improved clinical outcomes to PD_1 inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab in this study (Dong et al., 2016; 28039262). Mutations in TP53 have been associated with lymph node metastasis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (Seo et al., 2012; 22975805). In the context of metastatic non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), patients with EGFR sensitizing mutations and concurrent alterations in both RB1 and TP53 (triple_mutant), as seen here, may be at significantly higher risk of transformation to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), a mechanism of resistance to treatment with EGFR inhibitors; median time from advanced NSCLC diagnosis to SCLC transformation has been reported to be 17.8 months (Marcoux et al., 2019; 30550363, Lee et al., 2017; 28498782, Offin et al., 2019; 31228622). A retrospective study reported SCLC transformation in 18% (7/39) of patients with triple_mutant NSCLC and a shorter time to initial EGFR inhibitor discontinuation in these patients (9.5 months) compared to that in patients with EGFR/TP53_mutant NSCLC (12.3 months) or in patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations only (36.6 months) (Offin et al., 2019; 31228622). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% (17/176) and SDs in 53.4% (94/176) of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21.1% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12.1% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wild_type (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 31.9% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73.4% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 42.9% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76.2% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24.0% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71.4% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75.0% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Additionally, the combination of a CHK1 inhibitor and irinotecan reportedly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival in a TP53_mutated, but not TP53_wild_type, breast cancer xenotransplant mouse model (Ma et al., 2012; 22446188). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may also be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as APR_246 (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571, Lehmann et al., 2012; 22965953, Mohell et al., 2015; 26086967, Franssonet al., 2016; 27179933). In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, APR_246 combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "03", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "03"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Spigel et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9017, Hellmann et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT077, Ramalingam et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT078, Kowanetz et al., 2016; ESMO Abstract 77P, Gandara et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 12950, Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Velcheti et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12001, Herbst et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA79, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT07, Castellanos et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 2630, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Colli et al., 2016; 27197178, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Wang et al., 2017; 28923100, Carbone et al., 2017; 28636851, Rizvi et al., 2018; 29337640, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Forde et al., 2018; 29658848, Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Miao et al., 2018; 30150660, Chae et al., 2019; 30425022, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526). A large_scale genomic analysis found that unspecified lung non_small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), lung adenocarcinoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) samples harbored median TMBs between 6.3 and 9 Muts/Mb, and 12% to 17% of cases had an elevated TMB of greater than 20 Muts/Mb (FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). Lower TMB is observed more commonly in NSCLCs harboring known driver mutations (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, or MET) with the exception of BRAF or KRAS mutations, which are commonly observed in elevated TMB cases (Spigel et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9017). Although some studies have reported a lack of association between smoking and mutational burden in NSCLC (Schwartz et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 8533, Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843, Shim et al., 2015; 26200269), several other large studies did find a strong association with increased TMB (Govindan et al., 2012; 22980976, Ding et al., 2008; 18948947, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Kim et al., 2014; 24323028). TMB >10 muts/Mb was found to be more frequent in NSCLC metastases compared with primary tumors for both adenocarcinoma (38% vs. 25%) and SCC (41% vs. 35%) subtypes (Stein et al., 2019; DOI: 10.1200/PO.18.00376). A large study of Chinese patients with lung adenocarcinoma reported a shorter median OS for tumors with a higher number of mutations in a limited gene set compared with a lower mutation number (48.4 vs. 61.0 months)(Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843). Another study of patients with NSCLC correlated elevated TMB with poorer prognosis and significantly associated lower TMB in combination with PD_L1 negative status with longer median survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). However, no significant prognostic association of TMB and/or PD_L1 status with survival has been reported in patients with lung SCC (Yu et al., 2019; 30253973, Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). Multiple clinical trials of PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors or combination of PD_1 and CTLA_4 inhibitors in NSCLC have reported that patients with tumors harboring TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb derive greater clinical benefit from these therapies than those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb (based on this assay or others); similarly, higher efficacy of anti_PD_1 or anti_PD_L1 immunotherapy for treatment of patients with NSCLC, compared with the use of chemotherapy, has been observed more significantly in cases of TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (based on this assay or others); (Spigel et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9017, Hellmann et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT077, Ramalingam et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT078, Kowanetz et al., 2016; ESMO Abstract 77P, Gandara et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 12950, Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Velcheti et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12001, Herbst et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA79, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT07, Castellanos et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 2630, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Colli et al., 2016; 27197178, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Wang et al., 2017; 28923100, Carbone et al., 2017; 28636851, Rizvi et al., 2018; 29337640, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Forde et al., 2018; 29658848, Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Miao et al., 2018; 30150660, Chae et al., 2019; 30425022).
