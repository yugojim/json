The PI3K pathway is involved in cell signaling that regulates a number of critical cellular functions, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival (Samuels et al., 2005; 15950905, Engelman, 2009; 19629070). PIK3CA mutations E81K and C378Y have been reported in cancer as well as in overgrowth syndromes characterized by activating mutations in the PI3K_AKT pathway, suggesting that these mutations may be activating, although this has not been directly demonstrated (Chang et al., 2014; ASHG Abstract 3391T, Riviere et al., 2012; 22729224, Loconte et al., 2015; 25915946, Hucthagowder et al., 2017; 27307077, Kuentz et al., 2017; 28151489, Mirzaa et al., 2016; 27631024, Mirzaa et al., 2013; 23592320). PIK3CA mutations have been reported in 15% of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), and in 13% (2/15) of vulva SCC, 7.9% of lung SCC, and 7.9% of esophageal SCC cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2015; 25631445, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2012; 22960745, Lin et al., 2014; 24686850, Han et al., 2018; 29422544). One study reported that PIK3CA mutations were associated with poor prognosis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (Zhang et al., 2013; 23674897). Expression of PIK3CA mRNA or p110_alpha protein in patients with esophageal SCC has been correlated with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis, while PIK3CA mutation has been associated with longer survival (Wada et al., 2006; 16788758, Shigaki et al., 2013; 23532889, Akagi et al., 2009; 19212681). In one study, PI3K mutations were prevalent in advanced Stage 4 HNSCC tumors and associated with tumor progression (Lui et al., 2013; 23619167). Clinical and preclinical data in various tumor types indicate that PIK3CA activating alterations may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting PI3K (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574, Juric et al., 2018; 29401002, Gallant et al., 2019; 30793038, Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23, Delestre et al., 2021; 34613809, Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Santin et al., 2020; 31934607, Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871), AKT (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Smyth et al., 2021; 33863913), or mTOR (Park et al., 2016; 27105424, Lim et al., 2016; 26859683, Hou et al., 2014; 25426553, Varnier et al., 2019; 31351267, Janku et al., 2014; 24440717, Moroney et al., 2012; 22927482, Basho et al., 2017; 27893038, Moroney et al., 2011; 21890452). The Phase 2 NCI_MATCH study of copanlisib for patients with refractory solid tumors harboring PIK3CA mutations with or without PTEN loss met its primary endpoint with an ORR of 16% (4/25 PRs); responses (PR or SD >6 months) were seen in patients with ameloblastoma, liposarcoma, and carcinomas of the endometrium, ovary, esophagus, lung, and prostate (Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871). However, the Phase 2 study of copanlisib for patients with endometrial carcinoma harboring PIK3CA hotspot mutations failed to report any objective responses (n=11)(Santin et al., 2020; 31934607). Two other studies of copanlisib for patients with genomically unselected tumors reported 1 CR and 2 PRs (1 unconfirmed) among 16 total patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors with or without PTEN alterations (Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108). In the Phase 2 MATCH trial for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors, 28% (18/65) of patients experienced PFS lasting at least 6 months after treatment with taselisib; however, no ORs were observed in this study (Krop et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 101). A separate Phase 1b study of taselisib in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors reported an ORR of 0% (n=12) and a DCR of 17% (2/12) (Pascual et al., 2021; 32958578). In a Phase 1 trial of the dual PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitor apitolisib, 79% (11/14) of patients with PIK3CA_mutated advanced solid tumors experienced disease control (3 PRs, 8 SDs) (Dolly et al., 2016; 26787751). The PI3K inhibitor alpelisib is approved as a single agent for the treatment of patients with PIK3CA_related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) (Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23), but has shown limited activity as monotherapy for PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors with a Phase 1a study reporting an ORR of 6.0% (8/134) and a DCR of 58% (78/134) (Juric et al., 2018; 2941002).

A study assessing temsirolimus in combination with metformin in patients with advanced solid tumors reported a partial response for one patient with HNSCC, despite disease progression after treatment with docetaxel and cisplatin and subsequent treatment with zalutumumab (Mackenzie et al., 2010; 20978924). A Phase 1 study of temsirolimus in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in 18 patients with HNSCC reported a partial response rate of 22% and recommended Phase 2 testing (Fury et al., 2012; 22644799). However, a Phase 2 study of temsirolimus and erlotinib in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic, platinum_refractory HNSCC reported that this combination therapy was poorly tolerated, with the trial ending early after 50% (6/12) of patients withdrew from the study (Bauman et al., 2013; 23384718). A Phase 2 study of temsirolimus in patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical carcinoma reported a partial response in 3% (1/33) of patients and stable disease in 57.6% (19/33) of patients, with mild to moderate adverse effects and no toxicities greater than grade 3 (Tinker et al., 2013; 23672928).

A Phase 2 study of everolimus therapy has reported no objective responses in any of nine patients with refractory head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (Varadarajan et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract 5541). A Phase 1 trial in patients with advanced solid tumors reported that everolimus in combination with low dose weekly cisplatin showed activity in several tumor types, with 3 partial responses and prolonged stable disease observed in 5 patients out of 28 evaluable patients; one patient with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma obtained stable disease after more than 6 cycles of treatments (Fury et al., 2012; 21913034). Whereas frequent adverse events precluded a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for the combination of trametinib and everolimus in a Phase 1b trial for solid tumors (Tolcher et al., 2014; 25344362), a retrospective study for heavily pretreated patients with solid tumors reported tolerable regimens of the combination for 23/31 patients, with 16 patients treated >3 months and evaluable patients achieving a median PFS of 6.5 months (Patterson et al., 2018; AACR Abstract 3891). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04589845", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04341259", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03239015", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04337463", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04803318", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04526470", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05125523", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03772561", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04632992", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "PTEN", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": [{"Name": "R130*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "R130*"}}, "Interpretation": "PTEN encodes an inositol phosphatase that functions as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway; loss of PTEN can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and suppression of apoptosis (Simpson and Parsons, 2001; 11237521).

PTEN mutations have been reported in 7% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745), 7% (2/29) of cutaneous SCCs cBio_Li et al., 2015; 25589618), 1_5% of esophageal SCCs (cBio_Song et al., 2014; 24670651, cBio_Lin et al., 2014; 24686850), and 0_5% of head and neck SCCs (HNSCC)(cBio_Stransky et al., 2011; 21798893, cBio_Agrawal et al., 2011; 21798897, HNSCC_Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2015; 25631445). In a study of oral SCC, loss of PTEN expression correlated with metastasis and higher stage tumors (Rahmani et al., 2012; 23119114). PTEN loss or mutation leads to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway (Courtney et al., 2010; 20085938, Simpson and Parsons, 2001; 11237521, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Milella et al., 2017; 28220839). Across various tissues, most clinical studies have not observed an association between PTEN deficiency and response to inhibitors of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway. However, limited studies in prostate cancer (Templeton et al., 2013; 23582881, Sweeney et al., 2021; 34246347, de Bono et al., 2019; 30037818, Saura et al., 2017; 27872130), renal cell carcinoma (Voss et al., 2019; 30327302), breast cancer (Andre et al., 2016; 27091708, Dent et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 1008, Schmid et al., 2020; 31841354), and colorectal cancer (Gilcrease et al., 2019; 30302599) have reported an association between PTEN deficiency and response to inhibitors targeting the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway. Preclinical data indicate that PTEN loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Mendes_Pereira et al., 2009; 20049735, Shen et al., 2013; 23881923, Chatterjee et al., 2013; 23565244, McCormick et al., 2016; 26905328, Forster et al., 2011; 21468130), and clinical benefit has been observed for patients with PTEN_altered breast cancer including triple negative breast cancer (Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006, Eikesdal et al., 2021; 33242536), ovarian cancer (Dougherty et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 5536), uterine leiomyosarcoma (Pan et al., 2021; 33970096), and endometrial cancer (Forster et al., 2011; 21468130) treated with PARP inhibitors. However, some studies have reported a lack of association between PTEN mutation and PARP inhibitor sensitivity (Sandhu et al., 2013; 23810788, Romero et al., 2020; 32988624, Piha_Paul et al., 2018; AACR Abstract A096). One or more of the PTEN variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with hamartoma tumor syndrome (ClinVar, Mar 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. PTEN mutations underlie several inherited disorders, collectively termed PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS), which include Cowden syndrome (CS) and its variant Lhermitte_Duclos disease (LD), Bannayan_Riley_Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), PTEN_related Proteus syndrome (PS), and Proteus_like syndrome (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191, Orloff and Eng, 2008; 18794875). The mutation rate for PTEN in these disorders ranges from 20 to 85% of patients (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191, Zbuk and Eng, 2007; 17167516).

PTEN mutations have been reported in 7% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745), 7% (2/29) of cutaneous SCCs cBio_Li et al., 2015; 25589618), 1_5% of esophageal SCCs (cBio_Song et al., 2014; 24670651, cBio_Lin et al., 2014; 24686850), and 0_5% of head and neck SCCs (HNSCC)(cBio_Stransky et al., 2011; 21798893, cBio_Agrawal et al., 2011; 21798897, HNSCC_Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2015; 25631445). In a study of oral SCC, loss of PTEN expression correlated with metastasis and higher stage tumors (Rahmani et al., 2012; 23119114). PTEN loss or mutation leads to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway (Courtney et al., 2010; 20085938, Simpson and Parsons, 2001; 11237521, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Milella et al., 2017; 28220839). Across various tissues, most clinical studies have not observed an association between PTEN deficiency and response to inhibitors of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway. However, limited studies in prostate cancer (Templeton et al., 2013; 23582881, Sweeney et al., 2021; 34246347, de Bono et al., 2019; 30037818, Saura et al., 2017; 27872130), renal cell carcinoma (Voss et al., 2019; 30327302), breast cancer (Andre et al., 2016; 27091708, Dent et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 1008, Schmid et al., 2020; 31841354), and colorectal cancer (Gilcrease et al., 2019; 30302599) have reported an association between PTEN deficiency and response to inhibitors targeting the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway. Preclinical data indicate that PTEN loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Mendes_Pereira et al., 2009; 20049735, Shen et al., 2013; 23881923, Chatterjee et al., 2013; 23565244, McCormick et al., 2016; 26905328, Forster et al., 2011; 21468130), and clinical benefit has been observed for patients with PTEN_altered breast cancer including triple negative breast cancer (Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006, Eikesdal et al., 2021; 33242536), ovarian cancer (Dougherty et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 5536), uterine leiomyosarcoma (Pan et al., 2021; 33970096), and endometrial cancer (Forster et al., 2011; 21468130) treated with PARP inhibitors. However, some studies have reported a lack of association between PTEN mutation and PARP inhibitor sensitivity (Sandhu et al., 2013; 23810788, Romero et al., 2020; 32988624, Piha_Paul et al., 2018; AACR Abstract A096). One or more of the PTEN variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with hamartoma tumor syndrome (ClinVar, Mar 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. PTEN mutations underlie several inherited disorders, collectively termed PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS), which include Cowden syndrome (CS) and its variant Lhermitte_Duclos disease (LD), Bannayan_Riley_Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), PTEN_related Proteus syndrome (PS), and Proteus_like syndrome (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191, Orloff and Eng, 2008; 18794875). The mutation rate for PTEN in these disorders ranges from 20 to 85% of patients (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191, Zbuk and Eng, 2007; 17167516). The estimated incidence of Cowden syndrome is 1/200,000, which may be an underestimate due to the high variability of this disorder (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI_high (MSI_H) has been observed at high frequency in endometrial cancers (14_33%)(Santin et al., ASCO 2016; Abstract 414, Zighelboim et al., 2007; 17513808, Hampel et al., 2006; 16885385, Stelloo et al., 2016; 27006490, Kanopiene et al., 2014; 25458958, Black et al., 2006; 16549821, Nout et al., 2012; 22609107, Steinbakk et al., 2011; 21547578, Bilbao et al., 2010; 20005452), colorectal cancers (CRCs; 10_15%)(Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), and gastric cancers (12_35%)(Hiyama et al., 2004; 15209621, Wu et al., 1998; 9537253, dos Santos et al., 1996; 8536886, Fang et al., 2013; 23555086) and at lower frequencies in many other tumor types, including esophageal (Hall et al., 2016; ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancer Symposium Abstract 528, Farris et al., 2011; 21422910), small bowel (Gingras et al., 2015; AACR Pancreatic Cancer Abstract PR06, Agaramet al., 2010; 20395525, Ruemmele et al., 2009; 19252434, Planck et al., 2003; 12627520, Hibi et al., 1995; 7775257, Muneyuki et al., 2000; 11117578), hepatobiliary (Zhang et al., 2005; 15918185, Chiappini et al., 2004; 14656944, Suto et al., 2001; 11223838, Momoi et al., 2001; 11580146, Liengswangwong et al., 2003; 14506736, Moy et al., 2015; 25680569, Yoshida et al., 2000; 11063221), prostate (Cheng et al., 2016; Genitourinary Cancers Symposium Abstract 251, Pritchard et al., 2014; 25255306, Azzouzi et al., 2007; 17233803, Burger et al., 2006; 16924473), and urinary tract carcinomas (Harper et al., 2015; USCAP Abstract 905, Bai et al., 2013; 23690119, Giedl et al., 2014; 25319978, Yamamoto et al., 2006; 16675567). In one study, MSI_H status was associated with a positive prognostic effect in patients with gastric cancer treated with surgery alone and a negative predictive effect in patients treated with chemotherapy (Smyth et al., 2015; ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium Abstract 62). Data regarding the role of MSI_H on prognosis and survival in endometrial cancer are conflicting (Zighelboim et al., 2007; 17513808, Kanopiene et al., 2014; 25458958, Bilbao_Sieyro et al., 2014; 25026289, Mackay et al., 2010; 20304627, Steinbakk et al., 2011; 21547578, Arabi et al., 2009; 19275958, Black et al., 2006; 16549821). However, studies specifically analyzing early stage endometrial cancer have reported a correlation between MSI_H and decreased survival (Stelloo et al., 2016; 27006490, Mackay et al., 2010; 20304627, Nout et al., 2012; 22609107, Bilbao et al., 2010; 20005452), thereby suggesting that MSI_H predicts for poor prognosis in this subset of endometrial tumors. On the basis of prospective clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD_1_targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143) and PD_L1_targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92).

TET2 alterations have been reported at relatively low frequencies in solid tumors and are more prevalent in hematological malignancies (cBioPortal, Jan 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of TET2 alterations in solid tumors are limited (PubMed, Jan 2022). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in TET2 in solid tumors. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "08", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "08"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB level associated with lower rates of clinical benefit from treatment with PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors compared with patients with tumors harboring higher TMB levels, based on several studies in multiple solid tumor types (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of unknown primary harbors a median tumor mutational burden (TMB) of 7.6 Muts/Mb, and 22% of cases have high TMB (>20 Muts/Mb) (FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). High TMB has been reported frequently in skin SCC (67% of cases) (FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421, Goodman et al., 2019; 31003990); in 10% of lung SCC (Goodman et al., 2019; 31003990); 8_13% of head and neck SCC cases and non_small cell lung carcinoma, including lung SCC cases (Spigel et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9017, FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421); and in additional SCC cases, including urothelial (12%), cervical (6.5%), anal (3.8%), and esophageal (2.1%) (Goodman et al., 2019; 31003990). For patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) treated with PD_L1/PD_1 inhibitors, a Kaplan_Meier analysis showed a significant association for patients with high tumor mutational burden (TMB) with longer time to treatment failure (9.9 vs. 4.4 months) (Goodman et al., 2019; 31003990). In the majority of cutaneous SCC cases, high mutational burden has been attributed to UV exposure rather than defective DNA mismatch repair or polymerase activity (South et al., 2014; 24662767, Pickering et al., 2014; 25303977), although one study reported a small number of cutaneous SCC cases (4/39) harboring a mutation signature similar to that of human papillomavirus_positive head and neck SCC (Pickering et al., 2014; 25303977). In patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TMB is similar between cases with squamous and non_squamous histology (Spigel et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9017), and increased TMB is associated with higher tumor grade and poor prognosis (Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843), as well as with a decreased frequency of known driver mutations in EGFR, ALK, ROS1, or MET (1% of high_TMB samples each) but not BRAF (10%) or KRAS (9.4%) (Spigel et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9017). Although some studies have reported a lack of association between smoking and increased TMB in NSCLC (Schwartz et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 8533, Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843, Shim et al., 2015; 26200269), several other large studies did find a strong prognostic association (Govindan et al., 2012; 22980976, Ding et al., 2008; 18948947, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Kim et al., 2014; 24323028). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, increased tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Ott et al., 2019; 30557521, Cristescu et al., 2022; 35101941, Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). In the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors, significant improvement in ORR was observed for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) compared with those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526); similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). At the same TMB cutpoint, retrospective analysis of patients with solid tumors treated with any checkpoint inhibitor identified that tissue TMB scores \u2265 10 Muts/Mb were associated with prolonged time to treatment failure compared with scores <10 muts/Mb (HR=0.68) (Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). For patients with solid tumors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the CheckMate 848 trial, improved responses were observed in patients with a tissue TMB \u2265 10 Muts/Mb independent of blood TMB at any cutpoint in matched samples (Schenker at al., 2022; AACR Abstract 7845). However, support for higher TMB thresholds and efficacy was observed in the prospective Phase 2 MyPathway trial of atezolizumab for patients with pan_solid tumors, where improved ORR and DCR was seen in patients with TMB \u2265 16 Muts/Mb than those with TMB \u2265 10 and <16 Muts/Mb (Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409). Similarly, analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "PIK3CA", "Alteration": "E81K", "Title": "Tumor_Agnostic Precision Immuno_Oncology and Somatic Targeting Rational for You (TAPISTRY) Platform Study", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "TRKB, ALK, TRKC, ROS1, TRKA, RET, PD_L1, AKTs, ERBB2, MDM2, PI3K_alpha", "Locations": "Taipei City (Taiwan), Taoyuan County (Taiwan), Tainan (Taiwan), Shanghai City (China), Shanghai (China), Shatin (Hong Kong), Hong Kong (Hong Kong), Seoul (Korea, Republic of), Xi an (China), Tianjin (China)", "NCTID": "NCT04589845", "Note": "PIK3CA activating mutations may lead to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may therefore indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.
