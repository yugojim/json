TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a bTMB level that may be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Average bTMB levels in solid tumors other than NSCLC have not been evaluated (cBioPortal, COSMIC, PubMed, Mar 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). For patients with gastric cancer, increased TMB is reported to be associated with prolonged OS (Cai et al., 2020; 32141230, Zhao et al., 2021; 33510848, Wei et al., 2021; 33613701). One study observed that the OS and disease_free survival (DFS) benefits of postoperative chemotherapy were more pronounced in patients with TMB_low gastric cancer (stage Ib/II) compared to those with TMB_high; however, patients with stage III gastric cancer benefitted regardless of TMB level (Wang et al., 2021; 33687617). In esophageal cancer, patients with TMB_high who had not received radiotherapy had significantly reduced OS (p=0.038) compared to those with TMB_low (Yuan et al., 2019; 32165590). On the basis of clinical evidence in NSCLC and HSNCC, increased bTMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511) and anti_PD_1 (Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074) therapies. In NSCLC, multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 to 16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). In HNSCC, a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Increased tumor mutational burden may predict response to anti_PD_1 (alone or in combination with anti_CTLA_4) or anti_PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04237649", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04592913", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03281369", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03674567", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04181788", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02829723", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03797326", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03829501", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03530397", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03192345", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "CDK6", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "true", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "CDK6 encodes cyclin_dependent kinase 6, which regulates the cell cycle, differentiation, senescence, and apoptosis (Meyerson et al., 1994; 8114739, Grossel and Hinds, 2006; 16294322, Choi et al., 2014; 23644662). CDK6 and its functional homolog CDK4 are activated by D_type cyclins and promote cell cycle progression by inactivating the tumor suppressor Rb (Weinberg et al., 1995; 7736585, Musgrove et al., 2011; 21734724). Amplification of the chromosomal region that includes CDK6 has been reported in multiple cancer types, and has been associated with overexpression of CDK6 protein (Ismail et al., 2011; 21593195, van Dekken et al., 2009; 19167610). In the TCGA dataset, amplification of CDK6 was found in 8% of stomach adenocarcinoma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317). High_level amplification or copy number gain of CDK6 has been observed in 35.5% (11/31) of gastric cancer cell lines and was associated with increased CDK6 mRNA levels (Takada et al., 2005; 15723654). CDK6 overexpression has also been reported in patients with gastric cancer, and was found to be significantly associated with metastasis, poor differentiation, and poor survival (Feng et al., 2012; 21264532). Tumors with CDK6 activation may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib (Infante et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 2528, Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Finn et al., 2014; 25524798, Turner et al., 2015; 26030518, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27217383). Clinical benefit has been reported for patients with CDK6_amplified or mutated solid tumors in response to treatment with ribociclib (Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Konecny et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5557).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Tumors with CDK6 amplification may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04594005", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03099174", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03994796", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02693535", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02896335", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03310879", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03065062", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03454035", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02897375", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "FGFR2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": [{"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "FGFR2 encodes a tyrosine kinase cell surface receptor, which plays an important role in cell differentiation, growth, and angiogenesis (Powers et al., 2000; 11021964, Turner and Grose, 2010; 20094046). FGFR2 amplification has been reported in a variety of cancer types (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210) and has been shown to correlate with increased mRNA and protein expression (Pearson et al., 2016; 27179038, Tokunaga et al., 2016; 26933914). Higher level, clonal FGFR2 amplification has been reported to correlate with higher response rates to FGFR inhibitors (Pearson et al., 2016; 27179038, Andr\u00e9 et al., 2013; 23658459). FGFR2 fusions retaining the kinase domain encoded by exons 11_17 have been reported to be activating, oncogenic, and sensitive to FGFR inhibitors (Singh et al., 2012; 22837387, Lorenzi et al., 1996; 8799135, Wu et al., 2013; 23558953, Arai et al., 2013; 24122810, Wu et al., 2013; 23558953). Furthermore, FGFR2 variants lacking a portion of the cytoplasmic domain encoded by exon 18 have been reported to be oncogenic in vitro (Lorenzi et al., 1997; 9266968, Lorenzi et al., 1996; 8799135, Ueda et al., 1999; 10626794, Wu et al., 2013; 23558953, Cha et al., 2009; 19103595). FGFR2 variants truncated after exon 17, as observed here, have been reported to be oncogenic, efficiently transforming cultured cells and driving xenograft growth in mice with higher potency than full_length FGFR2 (Lorenzi et al., 1997; 9266968, Itoh et al., 1994; 8205545, Cha et al., 2009; 19103595, Ueda et al., 1999; 10626794). FGFR2 mutations have been reported in 0_4% of gastric adenocarcinoma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317, cBio_Wang et al., 2014; 24816253, cBio_Kakiuchi et al., 2014; 24816255, cBio_Wang et al., 2011; 22037554). In the Stomach Adenocarcinoma TCGA dataset, putative high_level amplification of FGFR2 has been reported in 5% of cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317). Studies have reported FGFR2 amplification in 2_9% of gastric cancer samples analyzed (Jung et al., 2012; 22440694, Matsumoto et al., 2012; 22240789, Deng et al., 2012; 22315472, Betts et al., 2013; 24306956). FGFR2 protein expression and pathway alteration has been associated with diffuse_type gastric cancer and not with the intestinal type (Toyokawa et al., 2009; 19287982, Hattori et al., 1996; 9816310, Yamashita et al., 2011; 21191688). However, one study did report FGFR2 protein overexpression in intestinal_type gastric cancer (Guo et al., 2012; 22533479). High FGFR2 protein expression or FGFR2 gene amplification in patients with gastric carcinoma has been correlated with worse prognosis, tumor infiltration, and a more advanced disease state (Toyokawa et al., 2009; 19287982, Hattori et al., 1996; 9816310, Matsumoto et al., 2012; 22240789, Jung et al., 2012; 22440694, Deng et al., 2012; 22315472, Betts et al., 2013; 24306956). FGFR2 activating mutations, amplifications, or fusions may confer sensitivity to selective FGFR inhibitors such as erdafitinib (Tabernero et al., 2015; 26324363, Siefker_Radtke et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 4503, Soria et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 4074, Park et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 4117), pemigatinib (Hollebecque et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 720P, Krook et al., 2019; 31371345, Abou_Alfa et al., 2020; 32203698, Kuboki et al., 2019; JSMO Abstract P1_156), infigratinib (Nogova et al., 2016; 27870574, Javle et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 265), E7090 (Morizane et al., 2020; ASCO GI Abstract 538), AZD4547 (Pearson et al., 2016; 27179038, Van Cutsem et al., 2017; 29177434, Aggarwal et al., 2019; 31195180, Chae et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 2503), Debio 1347 (Voss et al., 2019; 30745300, Clearly et al., 2021; 33926920), rogaratinib (Schuler et al., 2019; 31405822), futibatinib (Bahleda et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT121, Goyal et al., 2019; 31109923, Tran et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 155O), and derazantinib (Mazzaferro et al., 2019; 30420614) as well as to the multikinase inhibitors pazopanib (Borad et al., 2014; 24550739, Liao et al., 2013; 23786770) and ponatinib (Gozgit et al., 2012; 22238366). In a Phase 2 study of the FGFR inhibitor AZD4547, responses were reported in 33% (3/9) of patients with FGFR2_amplified gastroesophageal cancer; in this study, higher_level amplification correlated with higher likelihood of response to FGFR inhibitors (Pearson et al., 2016; 27179038). However, a randomized Phase 2 study of AZD4547 compared with paclitaxel for the treatment of patients with advanced stomach adenocarcinoma harboring FGFR2 amplification or polysomy reported no significant increase in median PFS, median OS, or ORR (Van Cutsem et al., 2017; 29177434). Bemarituzumab, a monoclonal antibody against the FGFR2 splice variant FGFR2b, has been evaluated to treat patients with gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma expressing FGFR2b (Catenacci et al., 2020; 32167861, Wainberg et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 160). In a Phase 1 study of single_agent bemarituzumab, the ORR was higher for patients with GEJ adenocarcinoma and high FGFR2b expression (all FGFR2_amplified) than for those with low FGFR2b expression (none FGFR2_amplified) (18% [5/28] vs. 8% [1/12]) (Catenacci et al., 2020; 32167861). The addition of bemarituzumab to modified FOLFOX6 as first_line treatment in a Phase 2 study for patients with FGFR2b_positive, HER2_negative gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma improved median OS (19.2 vs. 13.5 months, HR=0.60) with 12.5 months of follow_up, median PFS (9.5 vs. 7.4 months, HR=0.68, p=0.0727), and ORR (47% vs. 33%) (Catenacci et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4010, Wainberg et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 160). In the context of FGFR2 rearrangement, FGFR inhibitors have primarily been investigated for patients with previously treated intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), with the Phase 2 FIGHT_202 trial for pemigatinib (Abou_Alfa et al., 2020; 32203698) and a Phase 2 trial for infigratinib (Javle et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 265) respectively reporting ORRs of 36% (38/107) and 23% (25/108). Responses to erdafitinib have been reported in patients with FGFR2 fusion_positive urothelial carcinoma (Siefker_Radtke et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 4503) and endometrial carcinoma (Tabernero et al., 2015; 26324363).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "FGFR inhibitors may be relevant in tumors with alterations that activate FGFR2.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Pazopanib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Pazopanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets VEGFRs, PDGFRs, FGFRs, KIT, ITK, LCK, and c_FMS.

Following progression on multiple other lines of therapy, a patient with metastatic FGFR2_fusion_positive NSCLC treated with erdafitinib exhibited an 11_month PR (Qin et al., 2019; 30267839). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04083976", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03797326", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02450136", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04803318", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04189445", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03564691", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04008797", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03547037", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04042116", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04565275", "Include": "true"}]}}, {"Name": "rearrangement intron 17", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "rearrangement intron 17"}}, "Interpretation": "FGFR2 encodes a tyrosine kinase cell surface receptor, which plays an important role in cell differentiation, growth, and angiogenesis (Powers et al., 2000; 11021964, Turner and Grose, 2010; 20094046). FGFR2 amplification has been reported in a variety of cancer types (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210) and has been shown to correlate with increased mRNA and protein expression (Pearson et al., 2016; 27179038, Tokunaga et al., 2016; 26933914). Higher level, clonal FGFR2 amplification has been reported to correlate with higher response rates to FGFR inhibitors (Pearson et al., 2016; 27179038, Andr\u00e9 et al., 2013; 23658459). FGFR2 fusions retaining the kinase domain encoded by exons 11_17 have been reported to be activating, oncogenic, and sensitive to FGFR inhibitors (Singh et al., 2012; 22837387, Lorenzi et al., 1996; 8799135, Wu et al., 2013; 23558953, Arai et al., 2013; 24122810, Wu et al., 2013; 23558953). Furthermore, FGFR2 variants lacking a portion of the cytoplasmic domain encoded by exon 18 have been reported to be oncogenic in vitro (Lorenzi et al., 1997; 9266968, Lorenzi et al., 1996; 8799135, Ueda et al., 1999; 10626794, Wu et al., 2013; 23558953, Cha et al., 2009; 19103595). FGFR2 variants truncated after exon 17, as observed here, have been reported to be oncogenic, efficiently transforming cultured cells and driving xenograft growth in mice with higher potency than full_length FGFR2 (Lorenzi et al., 1997; 9266968, Itoh et al., 1994; 8205545, Cha et al., 2009; 19103595, Ueda et al., 1999; 10626794). FGFR2 mutations have been reported in 0_4% of gastric adenocarcinoma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317, cBio_Wang et al., 2014; 24816253, cBio_Kakiuchi et al., 2014; 24816255, cBio_Wang et al., 2011; 22037554). In the Stomach Adenocarcinoma TCGA dataset, putative high_level amplification of FGFR2 has been reported in 5% of cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317). Studies have reported FGFR2 amplification in 2_9% of gastric cancer samples analyzed (Jung et al., 2012; 22440694, Matsumoto et al., 2012; 22240789, Deng et al., 2012; 22315472, Betts et al., 2013; 24306956). FGFR2 protein expression and pathway alteration has been associated with diffuse_type gastric cancer and not with the intestinal type (Toyokawa et al., 2009; 19287982, Hattori et al., 1996; 9816310, Yamashita et al., 2011; 21191688). However, one study did report FGFR2 protein overexpression in intestinal_type gastric cancer (Guo et al., 2012; 22533479). High FGFR2 protein expression or FGFR2 gene amplification in patients with gastric carcinoma has been correlated with worse prognosis, tumor infiltration, and a more advanced disease state (Toyokawa et al., 2009; 19287982, Hattori et al., 1996; 9816310, Matsumoto et al., 2012; 22240789, Jung et al., 2012; 22440694, Deng et al., 2012; 22315472, Betts et al., 2013; 24306956). FGFR2 activating mutations, amplifications, or fusions may confer sensitivity to selective FGFR inhibitors such as erdafitinib (Tabernero et al., 2015; 26324363, Siefker_Radtke et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 4503, Soria et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 4074, Park et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 4117), pemigatinib (Hollebecque et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 720P, Krook et al., 2019; 31371345, Abou_Alfa et al., 2020; 32203698, Kuboki et al., 2019; JSMO Abstract P1_156), infigratinib (Nogova et al., 2016; 27870574, Javle et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 265), E7090 (Morizane et al., 2020; ASCO GI Abstract 538), AZD4547 (Pearson et al., 2016; 27179038, Van Cutsem et al., 2017; 29177434, Aggarwal et al., 2019; 31195180, Chae et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 2503), Debio 1347 (Voss et al., 2019; 30745300, Clearly et al., 2021; 33926920), rogaratinib (Schuler et al., 2019; 31405822), futibatinib (Bahleda et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT121, Goyal et al., 2019; 31109923, Tran et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 155O), and derazantinib (Mazzaferro et al., 2019; 30420614) as well as to the multikinase inhibitors pazopanib (Borad et al., 2014; 24550739, Liao et al., 2013; 23786770) and ponatinib (Gozgit et al., 2012; 22238366). In a Phase 2 study of the FGFR inhibitor AZD4547, responses were reported in 33% (3/9) of patients with FGFR2_amplified gastroesophageal cancer; in this study, higher_level amplification correlated with higher likelihood of response to FGFR inhibitors (Pearson et al., 2016; 27179038). However, a randomized Phase 2 study of AZD4547 compared with paclitaxel for the treatment of patients with advanced stomach adenocarcinoma harboring FGFR2 amplification or polysomy reported no significant increase in median PFS, median OS, or ORR (Van Cutsem et al., 2017; 29177434). Bemarituzumab, a monoclonal antibody against the FGFR2 splice variant FGFR2b, has been evaluated to treat patients with gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma expressing FGFR2b (Catenacci et al., 2020; 32167861, Wainberg et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 160). In a Phase 1 study of single_agent bemarituzumab, the ORR was higher for patients with GEJ adenocarcinoma and high FGFR2b expression (all FGFR2_amplified) than for those with low FGFR2b expression (none FGFR2_amplified) (18% [5/28] vs. 8% [1/12]) (Catenacci et al., 2020; 32167861). The addition of bemarituzumab to modified FOLFOX6 as first_line treatment in a Phase 2 study for patients with FGFR2b_positive, HER2_negative gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma improved median OS (19.2 vs. 13.5 months, HR=0.60) with 12.5 months of follow_up, median PFS (9.5 vs. 7.4 months, HR=0.68, p=0.0727), and ORR (47% vs. 33%) (Catenacci et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4010, Wainberg et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 160). In the context of FGFR2 rearrangement, FGFR inhibitors have primarily been investigated for patients with previously treated intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), with the Phase 2 FIGHT_202 trial for pemigatinib (Abou_Alfa et al., 2020; 32203698) and a Phase 2 trial for infigratinib (Javle et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 265) respectively reporting ORRs of 36% (38/107) and 23% (25/108). Responses to erdafitinib have been reported in patients with FGFR2 fusion_positive urothelial carcinoma (Siefker_Radtke et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 4503) and endometrial carcinoma (Tabernero et al., 2015; 26324363).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "FGFR inhibitors may be relevant in tumors with alterations that activate FGFR2.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Pazopanib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Pazopanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets VEGFRs, PDGFRs, FGFRs, KIT, ITK, LCK, and c_FMS.

It is an oncogene and may be activated in as many as 20% of cancers (Dang et al., 2006; 16904903). MYC dysregulation (amplification, overexpression, translocation) has been identified in a number of different cancer types (Nesbit et al., 1999; 10378696). MYC amplification has been significantly linked with increased mRNA and protein levels and results in the dysregulation of a large number of target genes (Blancato et al., 2004; 15083194, Dang et al., 2006; 16904903, Fromont et al., 2013; 23574779). MYC amplification has been reported in 9_51% of gastric adenocarcinomas, although gains of chromosome 8q, where the MYC gene resides, have been identified in up to 78% of gastric adenocarcinomas (Mitsui et al., 2007; 17431415, Hara et al., 1998; 9759658, Buffart et al., 2009; 19697059, Calcagno et al., 2013; 24053468, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317). MYC dysregulation, especially MYC amplification, has been suggested to play a role in gastric carcinogenesis (Calcagno et al., 2008; 18932273). Overexpression of MYC protein and mRNA has been associated with tumor metastasis, particularly in intestinal type gastric adenocarcinoma, and high MYC expression has been observed in gastric cancer samples from patients with poor disease_free survival (Kozma et al., 2001; 11299830, Burbano et al., 2006; 16886612, Han et al., 1999; 10576148, de Souza et al., 2013; 23717612, Radetsky, 1990; 2405346). There are no available therapies that directly target MYC. However, preclinical data indicate that MYC overexpression may predict sensitivity to investigational agents targeting CDK1 (Horiuchi et al., 2012; 22430491, Goga et al., 2007; 17589519), CDK2 (Molenaar et al., 2009; 19525400), Aurora kinase A (Dammert et al., 2019; 31375684, Mollaoglu et al., 2017; 28089889, Robert et al., 2017; 29088717, Wang et al., 2017; 28417568, Takahashi et al., 2015; 25632068, Li et al., 2018; 30226440, Kong et al., 2017; DOI: 10.21037/tcr.2017.06.41, Mahadeva et al.,2014; 24893165, Park et al., 2019; 31429028), Aurora kinase B (Helfrich et al., 2016; 27496133, Hook et al., 2012; 22222631, Yang et al., 2010; 20643922, He et al., 2019; 30540594), glutaminase (Shroff et al., 2015; 25964345, Effenberger et al., 2017; 29156762, Shen et al., 2018; 30103944, Xiang et al., 2015; 25915584), or BET bromodomain_containing proteins (Delmore et al., 2011; 21889194, Bandopadhayay et al., 2013; 24297863, Loven et al., 2013; 23582323, Otto et al., 2019; 31734632), as well as agents targeting both HDAC and PI3K (Dong et al., 2013; 23866964, Pei et al., 2016; 26977882; Fu et al., 2019; 30224636). A Phase 2 study reported a PFS benefit associated with a combination of the Aurora A kinase inhibitor alisertib and paclitaxel as second_line therapy for patients with MYC_overexpressed small cell lung cancer but not for patients without MYC overexpression (Simmons et al., 2020; 31655296). A patient with MYC_amplified invasive ductal breast carcinoma experienced a PR to an Aurora kinase inhibitor (Ganesan et al., 2014; 25253784). The glutaminase inhibitor CB_839, in combination with either everolimus or cabozantinib, has demonstrated encouraging efficacy in Phase 1 and 2 studies enrolling patients with pretreated advanced renal cell carcinoma (Tannir et al., 2018; ASCO GU Abstract 603, Motzer et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA54). MYC amplification has also been suggested to predict response to chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer in some studies (Pereira et al., 2013; 23555992, Yasojima et al., 2011; 21741827). Preclinical evidence suggests that colon cancer cells with MYC amplification may be more sensitive to 5_fluorouracil and paclitaxel (Arango et al., 2001; 11406570, Bottone et al., 2003; 14516787).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "MYC overexpression may predict sensitivity to inhibition of CDKs, especially CDK1 and CDK2, of Aurora kinases, including Aurora kinase A and B, and of BET domain proteins, which are reported to downregulate MYC expression and MYC_dependent transcriptional programs.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT03220347", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03297424", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04555837", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT01434316", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "DNMT3A", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "F732fs*8", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "F732fs*8"}}, "Interpretation": "The DNMT3A gene encodes the protein DNA methyltransferase 3A, an enzyme that is involved in the methylation of newly synthesized DNA, a function critical for gene regulation (Trowbridge and Orkin, 2012; 22200773, Ch\u00e9din, 2011; 21507354). The role of DNMT3A in cancer is uncertain, as some reports describe increased expression and contribution to tumor growth, whereas others propose a role for DNMT3A as a tumor suppressor (Yang et al., 2011; 21887466, Vallb\u00f6hmer et al., 2006; 16870044, Daskalos et al., 2011; 21351083, Fabbri et al., 2007; 17890317, Gao et al., 2011; 22011581, Kim et al., 2013; 23031157). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt DNMT3A function or expression (Chen et al., 2005; 15861382, Guo et al., 2015; 25383530, Sandoval et al., 2019; 30705090, Zhang et al., 2018; 29414941). DNMT3A alterations have been reported at relatively low frequencies in solid tumors and are more prevalent in hematological malignancies (cBioPortal, Feb 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of DNMT3A alterations in solid tumors are limited (PubMed, Feb 2021). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in DNMT3A in solid tumors. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

EPHB receptors, including EPHB4, have been shown to undergo dysregulation (amplification, mutation, under_ or overexpression) in a number of different cancer types (Pasquale, 2010; 20179713). EPHB4 amplification has been reported in several solid tumor types (Hasina et al., 2013; 23100466, Boberg et al., 2013; 23063927, Masood et al., 2006; 16615113, Sinha et al., 2006; 17043250, Cromer et al., 2004; 14676830) and was associated with advanced disease stage in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (Sinha et al., 2006; 17043250). Activating missense mutations in or near the tyrosine kinase domain, including G723S, A742V, and P881S, have also been identified in lung cancer (Ferguson et al., 2015; 26073592). Increased EPHB4 mRNA and/or protein expression has been reported in a variety of cancer types, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (Sinha et al., 2006; 17043250, Masood et al., 2006; 16615113, Ferguson et al., 2014; 25391996, Yavrouian et al., 2008; 18794445), gastric and esophageal (Liersch_L\u00f6hn et al., 2016; 26414866, Hu et al., 2014; 24771266, Hasina et al., 2013; 23100466, Li et al., 2011; 20686847, Yin et al., 2017; 28739744), colorectal carcinoma (CRC) (Stephenson et al., 2001; 11801186, Liu et al., 2002; 11920461, McCall et al., 2016; 27273865, Stremitzer et al., 2016; 27535973, Lv et al., 2016; 27072105, Guijarro_Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2013; 23579861, Kumar et al., 2009; 19366806), breast (Wu et al., 2004; 15029258, Berclaz et al., 2002; 12168060, Brantley_Sieders et al., 2011; 21935409, Huang et al., 2015; 26191333, Pradeep et al., 2015; 26481148), ovarian (Pradeep et al., 2015; 26481148, Alam et al., 2008; 18231102, Kumar et al., 2007; 17353927), endometrial (Takai et al., 2001; 11295082, Dong et al., 2017; 28454369, Berclaz et al., 2003; 12562648), thyroid (Sharma et al., 2015; 24634162, Giaginis et al., 2016; 26220827, Xuqing et al., 2012; 22528941), lung (Ferguson et al., 2013; 23844053, Zheng et al., 2012; 22684742), glioma (Chen et al., 2013; 23138393, Tu et al., 2012; 22374425), and other solid tumors (Li and Zhao, 2013; 23079712, Xia et al., 2005; 15930280, Alam et al., 2009; 19356789, Ozg\u00fcr et al., 2011; 19272799, Li et al., 2014; 25148033, Pierscianek et al., 2017; 27388534, Pierscianek et al., 2016; 26951238, Becerikli et al., 2015; 25274141, Xia et al., 2005; 15958611). In several of these studies, increased EPHB4 expression has been associated with clinicopathologic features, including disease stage (Sinha et al., 2006; 17043250, Li and Zhao, 2013; 23079712, Wu et al., 2004; 15029258, Alam et al., 2008; 18231102, Kumar et al., 2007; 17353927, Alam et al., 2009; 19356789, Zheng et al., 2012; 22684742, Li et al., 2014; 25148033), histological grade (Hasina et al., 2013; 23100466, Wu et al., 2004; 15029258, Takai et al., 2001; 11295082, Tu et al., 2012; 22374425), and hormone receptor status (Huang et al., 2015; 26191333, Dong et al., 2017; 28454369). High EPHB4 expression has been associated with inferior survival in multivariate analyses for patients with CRC treated with bevacizumab [hazard ratio (HR) = 5.95] (Guijarro_Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2013; 23579861), HNSCC (HR = 2.95) (Yavrouian et al., 2008; 18794445), epithelial ovarian cancer (HR = 4.53) (Pradeep et al., 2015; 26481148), or glioma (HR = 3.21) (Tu et al., 2012; 22374425). There are no approved therapies available to target EPHB4 alterations in cancer. sEPHB4 is a soluble monomeric extracellular domain of EPHB4 that functions as an antagonist of EphrinB2_EPHB4 interaction (Kertesz et al., 2006; 16322467), and fusion of sEPHB4 with human serum albumin (HSA) increases its stability (Shi et al., 2012; 22411527). Recombinant sEPHB4_HSA is under investigation in clinical trials. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that sEPHB4_HSA inhibits cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth, including for cells expressing cancer_associated EPHB4 mutants or overexpressing wild_type EPHB4 (Kertesz et al., 2006; 16322467, Li et al., 2014; 25148033, Liu et al., 2013; 23721559, Bhatia et al., 2016; 27941840, Scehnet et al., 2009; 18836096, Ferguson et al., 2015; 26073592). In addition, small_molecule inhibitors targeting multiple tyrosine kinases including EPHB4, such as JI_101 and XL647, have been under preclinical and clinical investigation (Werner et al., 2015; 26365907, Pietanza et al., 2012; 22011666, Pietanza et al., 2012; 22722787).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "GATA6", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "true", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "GATA6 encodes a zinc finger transcription factor, which is involved in the development of several tissues and is expressed in proliferating cells throughout the intestinal tract (Zheng et al., 2010; 21779441). GATA6 has been described as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene, which may be dependent on the tumor type. GATA6 was identified as a tumor suppressor in a preclinical model of astrocytoma and verified in human samples; GATA6 mutations, loss of GATA6 expression, or loss of heterozygosity were discovered in glioblastomas, but not in lower grade astrocytomas, and restoration of GATA6 inhibited glioblastoma cell line growth (Kamnasaran et al., 2007; 17463088). However, overexpression of GATA6 has been detected in pancreatic and bile duct carcinoma and is associated with increased proliferation, cell cycle progression, and colony formation, which have been shown to be inhibited by GATA6 siRNA knockdown in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines (Fu et al., 2008; 18769116, Kwei et al., 2008; 18535672). GATA6 overexpression in colorectal carcinoma is also associated with poor prognosis and metastasis (Shen et al., 2013; 23784465).

Gs_alpha is a guanine_nucleotide binding protein (G protein) that is involved in hormonal regulation of adenylate cyclase (Hayward et al., 1998; 9860993). GNAS has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210) and may be biologically relevant in this context (Zack et al., 2013; 24071852, Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). GNAS alterations that have been shown to result in constitutive activation of adenylyl cyclase and an increase in cellular cAMP concentration (Masters et al., 1989; 2549064, Graziano and Gilman, 1989; 2549065, Jang and Juhnn, 2001; 11322485, Landis et al., 1989; 2549426, Tobar_Rubin et al., 2013; 23288949, Mariot et al., 2011; 20887824) are predicted to be activating. Mutations at R201 specifically are commonly associated with McCune_Albright syndrome, a disease that can co_occur with various cancers in patients with GNAS activating mutations (Weinstein et al., 1991; 1944469, Collins et al., 2003; 12970318, Nault et al., 2012; 21835143). The highest incidences of GNAS mutations have been reported in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (40_66%)(Furukawa et al., 2011; 22355676, Wu et al., 2011; 21775669) and appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (50_72%)(Nishikawa et al., 2013; 23403822, Singhi et al., 2014; 24925222) as well as in tumors affecting the peritoneum (22%), pituitary gland (20%), bone (15%), pancreas (12%), and small intestine (12%)(COSMIC, 2021)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Amplification of GNAS has been reported in ovarian epithelial carcinomas (12_30%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2011; 21720365, Kan et al., 2010; 20668451, Tominaga et al., 2010; 20537689), colorectal adenocarcinoma (9%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696), stomach adenocarcinoma (7%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317), lung adenocarcinoma (6.5%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552), breast invasive carcinoma (6.5%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 23000897), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (6%)(Bio_Witkiewicz et al., 2015; 25855536), and sarcomas (5.8%)(cBio_Barretina et al., 2010; 20601955). GNAS mutations are rare in hematological malignancies generally (COSMIC, 2021)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878, cBio_Lohr et al., 2014; 24434212, Chapman et al., 2011; 21430775). Activating GNAS mutations have been identified in gastrointestinal polyps in 75% (3/4) of patients with McCune_Albright syndrome (Zacharin et al., 2011; 21357941). Amplification of GNAS has been associated with shorter progression_free survival in patients with ovarian cancer (Kan et al., 2010; 20668451, Tominaga et al., 2010; 20537689), while activating GNAS mutations have been correlated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in patients with gastric cancer (Alakus et al., 2009; 20027678). There are no therapies targeted to GNAS mutation in cancer. However, there is limited data indicating that a patient with appendiceal adenocarcinoma and a GNAS mutation (R201H) benefited from trametinib for 4 months (Ang et al., 2017; 28868010). Additionally, a patient with GNAS_mutated Erdheim_Chester disease exhibited a PR following treatment with single_agent trametinib (Saunders et al., 2019; 31740567).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Cannot Be Determined", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Cannot Be Determined"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. In the context of diffuse_type gastric cancer, a higher frequency of MSI_H tumors has been reported in familial (28%, 7/25) versus sporadic (7%, 7/107) tumors; no difference in frequency of MSI_H tumors was observed for intestinal_type gastric cancer (Fang et al., 2013; 23555086). MSI_H tumors have been frequently associated with hypermethylation and loss of MLH1 expression in cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract, including esophageal, gastroesophageal junction, and gastric adenocarcinomas (Fang et al., 2013; 23555086, Gu et al., 2009; 19621725, Sasaki et al., 2011; 22866067, Fleisher et al., 1999; 10070967, Vasavi et al., 2010; 21045259, Zhang et al., 2013; 24035280). MSI_H gastric cancers are associated with certain clinicopathological and molecular features, including intestinal type differentiation, antral location, advanced age, reduced lymph node metastasis, and better prognosis (Zhu et al., 2015; 26137290, Leung et al., 1999; 9892201, dos Santos et al., 1996; 8536886, Wu et al., 1998; 9537253, Seo et al., 2015; 26078567, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317). A retrospective meta_analysis of the prognostic role of MSI in gastric cancers reported an increased DFS and OS in patients with MSI_H versus MSS/MSI_Low (Pietrantonio et al., 2019; 31513484). Conversely, in the same study, MSI_H was a negative predictor of response and MSS/MSI_Low correlated with increased benefit for patients treated with chemotherapy plus surgery as opposed to surgery alone (Pietrantonio et al., 2019; 31513484). In gastroesophageal cancer, MSI_H status was associated with shorter PFS compared to MSS patients for patients treated with chemotherapy (mPFS 4.8 months vs 6.9 months, HR=0.4) (Janjigian et al., 2018; 29122777). On the basis of prospective clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD_1_targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143) and PD_L1_targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92). As the MSI status of this tumor is unknown, the relevance of these therapeutic approaches is unclear. While approximately 80% of MSI_H tumors arise due to somatic inactivation of an MMR pathway protein, about 20% arise due to germline mutations in one of the MMR genes (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942), which are associated with a condition known as Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC) (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756). Lynch syndrome leads to an increased risk of colorectal, endometrial, gastric, and other cancers (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756, Pande et al., 2012; 22714864, Kastrinos and Syngal, 2007; 17920897) and has an estimated prevalence in the general population ranging from 1:600 to 1:2000 (Silva et al., 2009; 19466295, Sehgal et al., 2014; 24978665, de la Chapelle et al., 2005; 16136383). Therefore, in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": [{"Name": "H214R", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "H214R"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 is frequently mutated in cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, with alterations reported in 34\u201372% of esophageal, gastroesophageal junction, and gastric adenocarcinomas (Dulak et al., 2013; 23525077, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317, Sengpiel et al., 2009; 19160092, P\u00fchringer_Oppermann et al., 2006; 16538517). Overexpression of p53 protein, which may occur as a result of mutation, has been reported in approximately 36% of gastric cancers, with p53 expression reported to be more frequent in intestinal_type compared with diffuse_type gastric cancer (Lee et al., 2014; 23969480, Sezer et al., 2013; 23613399, Victorzon et al., 1996; 8664030, Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2011; 21116760). While some studies have reported no association between TP53 mutation status and prognosis in patients with esophageal carcinoma or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (Sengpiel et al., 2009; 19160092, P\u00fchringer_Oppermann et al., 2006; 16538517) others have associated TP53 mutation and elevated p53 expression with poor prognosis for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Han et al., 2007; 17760650, Yamasaki et al., 2010; 19941080) or stomach cancer (Liu et al., 2012; 23285001, Wiksten et al., 2008; 18751407, Migliavacca et al., 2004; 15254976). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% (17/176) and SDs in 53.4% (94/176) of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21.1% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12.1% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wild_type (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 31.9% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73.4% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 42.9% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76.2% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24.0% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71.4% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75.0% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Additionally, the combination of a CHK1 inhibitor and irinotecan reportedly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival in a TP53_mutated, but not TP53_wild_type, breast cancer xenotransplant mouse model (Ma et al., 2012; 22446188). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may also be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as APR_246 (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571, Lehmann et al., 2012; 22965953, Mohell et al., 2015; 26086967, Franssonet al., 2016; 27179933). In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, APR_246 combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}, {"Name": "L206fs*3", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "L206fs*3"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 is frequently mutated in cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, with alterations reported in 34\u201372% of esophageal, gastroesophageal junction, and gastric adenocarcinomas (Dulak et al., 2013; 23525077, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317, Sengpiel et al., 2009; 19160092, P\u00fchringer_Oppermann et al., 2006; 16538517). Overexpression of p53 protein, which may occur as a result of mutation, has been reported in approximately 36% of gastric cancers, with p53 expression reported to be more frequent in intestinal_type compared with diffuse_type gastric cancer (Lee et al., 2014; 23969480, Sezer et al., 2013; 23613399, Victorzon et al., 1996; 8664030, Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2011; 21116760). While some studies have reported no association between TP53 mutation status and prognosis in patients with esophageal carcinoma or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (Sengpiel et al., 2009; 19160092, P\u00fchringer_Oppermann et al., 2006; 16538517) others have associated TP53 mutation and elevated p53 expression with poor prognosis for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Han et al., 2007; 17760650, Yamasaki et al., 2010; 19941080) or stomach cancer (Liu et al., 2012; 23285001, Wiksten et al., 2008; 18751407, Migliavacca et al., 2004; 15254976). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% (17/176) and SDs in 53.4% (94/176) of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21.1% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12.1% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wild_type (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 31.9% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73.4% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 42.9% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76.2% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24.0% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71.4% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75.0% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Additionally, the combination of a CHK1 inhibitor and irinotecan reportedly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival in a TP53_mutated, but not TP53_wild_type, breast cancer xenotransplant mouse model (Ma et al., 2012; 22446188). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may also be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as APR_246 (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571, Lehmann et al., 2012; 22965953, Mohell et al., 2015; 26086967, Franssonet al., 2016; 27179933). In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, APR_246 combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with high tumor fraction values have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus higher sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at a lower risk of false negative results (Li et al., 2021; AACR Abstract 2231). However, if tumor fraction is not detected as high, it does not exclude the presence of disease burden or compromise the confidence of reported alterations. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels. In the research setting, changes in tumor fraction estimates have been associated with treatment duration and clinical response and may be a useful indicator for future cancer management (Bronkhorst et al., 2019; 30923679, Raja et al., 2018; 30093454, Hrebien et al., 2019; 30860573, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5039, Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Goodall et al., 2017; 28450425, Goldberg et al., 2018; 29330207).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "Blood Tumor Mutational Burden", "Alteration": "20", "Title": "KAZ954 Alone and With PDR001, NZV930 and NIR178 in Advanced Solid Tumors", "StudyPhase": "PHASE null", "Target": "ADORA2A, CD73, PD_1", "Locations": "Taipei (Taiwan), Sunto Gun (Japan), Singapore (Singapore), Milano (Italy), Barcelona (Spain), California, Illinois, Missouri, Connecticut, Texas", "NCTID": "NCT04237649", "Note": "Increased tumor mutational burden may predict response to anti_PD_1 (alone or in combination with anti_CTLA_4) or anti_PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "Blood Tumor Mutational Burden", "Alteration": "20", "Title": "Assessing Durvalumab and FLOT Chemotherapy in Resectable Gastric and Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 3", "Target": "PD_L1", "Locations": "Taipei (Taiwan), Taoyuan City (Taiwan), Taichung (Taiwan), Tainan City (Taiwan), Kaohsiung (Taiwan), Hwasun_gun (Korea, Republic of), Anyang_si (Korea, Republic of), Seongnam_si (Korea, Republic of), Seoul (Korea, Republic of), Suita_shi (Japan)", "NCTID": "NCT04592913", "Note": "Increased tumor mutational burden may predict response to anti_PD_1 (alone or in combination with anti_CTLA_4) or anti_PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "Blood Tumor Mutational Burden", "Alteration": "20", "Title": "A Study of Multiple Immunotherapy_Based Treatment Combinations in Patients With Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer (G/GEJ) (Morpheus_Gastric Cancer)", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1/2", "Target": "MEK, CXCR4, VEGFRs, PD_L1", "Locations": "Taipei City (Taiwan), Zhongzheng Dist.
