Loss of functional ATM promotes tumorigenesis (Cremona and Behrens, 2014; 23851492). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt ATM function or expression (Jiang et al., 2006; 16603769, Fernandes et al., 2005; 15713674, Scott et al., 2002; 11805335). ATM mutations have been reported in 1% of glioblastoma cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890). An analysis of Grades 1_4 astrocytomas detected upregulation of ATM mRNA expression (Kheirollahi et al., 2011; 20077038). Higher expression of the ATM protein correlated with longer overall and progression_free survival in a study of 69 glioblastoma cases (Seol et al., 2011; 21617879). However, ATM gene and protein expression in glioblastoma cells has also been correlated with resistance to radiation therapy; glioma cells with lower ATM expression have been found to be more sensitive to radiation than cells with higher ATM expression (Tribius et al., 2001; 11380241, Roy et al., 2006; 16631604, Biddlestone_Thorpe et al., 2013; 23620409). In addition, one study reported that the ATM kinase inhibitor KU_60019 inhibited glioma cell growth and invasion and sensitized cells to radiation (Biddlestone_Thorpe et al., 2013; 23620409). Preclinical studies have also shown that ATM kinase inactivation and ATM inhibitors such as LY294002 and KU_55933 increase the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to cisplatin and temozolomide (Carminati et al., 2013; 24218165, Nadkarni et al., 2012; 23054561, Eich et al., 2013; 23960094). Loss of functional ATM results in a defective DNA damage response and homologous recombination_mediated DNA repair and may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Michels et al., 2014; 24037533). Clinical data in prostate cancer (Mateo et al., 2015; 26510020, Mateo et al., 2020; 31806540, de Bono et al., 2020; ASCO GU Abstract 119, Abida et al., 2020; 32086346), gastric cancer (Bang et al., 2015; 26282658), colorectal cancer (Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006), breast cancer (Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006), papillary renal cell carcinoma (Olson et al., 2016; 27079472), and cholangiocarcinoma (Piha_Paul et al., 2018; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract A096) indicate that loss or inactivation of ATM may confer sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Weston et al., 2010; 20739657, Williamson et al., 2010; 20124459, Gilardini et al., 2013; 24252502, Bryant and Helleday, 2006; 16556909, Ihnen et al., 2013; 23729402, Williamson et al., 2012; 22416035, Kubota et al., 2014; 24841718, Huehls et al., 2012; 22833573). In Phase 1 trials of ATR inhibitors, a heavily pretreated patient with colorectal cancer who achieved a CR to berzosertib (O Carrigan et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2504) and 4 out of 4 patients with diverse solid tumors who achieved PRs to BAY1895344 (Yap et al., 2020; 32988960) harbored ATM inactivation or protein loss; studies showing reduced cell viability and increased DNA damage in preclinical models of solid tumors (Menezes et al., 2015; 25232030, Vendetti et al., 2015; 26517239, Min et al., 2017; 28138034) and hematologic malignancies (Menezes et al., 2015; 25232030, Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132) also support the increased sensitivity of ATM_deficient cells to ATR inhibitors. Preclinical experiments also indicate that loss of ATM causes dependency on DNA_PKcs in cancer cells; DNA_PKcs inhibitors promoted apoptosis in ATM_deficient cells and were active in a lymphoma mouse model lacking ATM activity (Riabinska et al., 2013; 23761041). ATM mutation carriers have increased cancer risk, with female carriers displaying a 38% lifetime risk of breast cancer (van Os et al., 2016; 26662178). Biallelic mutations in ATM underlie the rare autosomal_recessive inherited disorder ataxia_telangiectasia (A_T), also referred to as genome instability or DNA damage response syndrome (Rothblum_Oviatt et al., 2016; 27884168). This disease is characterized by genomic instability, sensitivity to DNA_damaging agents, and increased risk of developing cancer (Shiloh and Ziv, 2013; 23847781, Rothblum_Oviatt et al., 2016; 27884168). The prevalence of A_T is estimated at 1:40,000 to 1:100,000 worldwide (Rothblum_Oviatt et al., 2016; 27884168). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of ATM is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors may detect nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

Talazoparib has been studied primarily in the context of BRCA_mutated, HER2_negative breast cancer, where patients achieved significantly longer median PFS (8.6 vs. 5.6 months, HR=0.54), a higher ORR (62.6% vs. 27.2%), and improved quality of life on talazoparib compared with standard chemotherapy in a Phase 3 study (Litton et al., 2018; 30110579, Ettl et al., 2018; 30124753).

An additional case study reported a durable response (>2 years) to combination olaparib and temozolomide in a pediatric patient with glioblastoma (Valiakhmetova et al., 2020; 32043779). Olaparib has been studied primarily for the treatment of ovarian cancer, with response rates often significantly higher for patients with BRCA mutations than for those without (Fong et al., 2009; 19553641, Gelmon et al., 2011; 21862407); higher response rates have also been observed for patients with platinum_sensitive versus platinum_resistant cancer (Domchek et al., 2016; 26723501, Matulonis et al., 2016; 26961146, Gelmon et al., 2011; 21862407, Fong et al., 2010; 20406929). As maintenance therapy for patients with newly diagnosed or platinum_sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer, olaparib has demonstrated significantly improved median PFS and median OS compared with placebo in the Phase 3 SOLO_1 study (Moore et al., 2018; 30345884) and in multiple later_phase studies (Pujade_Lauraine et al., 2017; 28754483, Ledermann et al., 2016; 27617661, Ledermann et al., 2012; 22452356, Ledermann et al., 2014; 24882434).

In heavily pretreated patients with a germline BRCA1/2 mutation who had received 2_4 prior chemotherapy treatments and had a progression free interval of greater than 6 months, 65% (17/26) of patients achieved an objective response with rucaparib treatment (Shapira_Frommer et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5513). In a Phase 2 study evaluating rucaparib for patients with advanced breast or ovarian cancer and germline BRCA1/2 mutations, disease control was observed in 92% (12/13) of patients with ovarian cancer treated with oral rucaparib dosed continuously, but no objective responses were reported in breast cancer patients (n=23). However, 39% (9/23) of evaluable patients with breast cancer achieved SD lasting 12 weeks or more (Drew et al., 2016; 27002934). In a Phase 1 study of rucaparib treatment in patients with solid tumors, 3/4 patients with ovarian cancer and 1/1 patient with breast cancer given the recommended Phase 2 dose reported objective responses; all responders harbored BRCA1/2 mutations (Kristeleit et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 2573).

These kinases function downstream of RAS as part of the MAPK (RAF_MEK_ERK) signaling cascade that facilitates cell proliferation, survival and transformation (Holderfield et al., 2014; 24957944, Burotto et al., 2014; 24948110). BRAF mutations have been reported in up to 20% of all cancers, with the majority of mutations occurring at the V600 position (Davies et al., 2002; 12068308, Kandoth et al., 2013; 24132290). Among the V600 mutations, V600E accounts for 70_80% of observations, V600K for 10_30%, and V600R for 5_7%, with V600D comprising the majority of the rest (Davies et al., 2002; 12068308, Greaves et al., 2013; 23273605, Klein et al., 2013; 23237741). Mutations at V600 are Class 1 BRAF alterations that have been shown to constitutively activate BRAF kinase and hyperactivate the downstream MEK_ERK signaling, promoting oncogenic transformation (Wellbrock et al., 2004; 15059882, Davies et al., 2002; 12068308). In multiple cancer types, multiple mutations at V600, including V600E, V600K, V600R, V600D, and V600M, exhibited sensitivity to V600_targeted therapies (Hauschild et al., 2012; 22735384, McArthur et al., 2014; 24508103, Fisher et al., 2012; 22904646, Yang et al., 2010; 20551065, Gentilcore et al., 2013; 23317446, Klein et al., 2013; 23237741, van den Brom et al., 2013; 23473613, Klein et al., 2013; 23490649, Ponti et al., 2013; 23463675, Ponti et al., 2012; 23031422, Parakh et al., 2015; 25382067, Lee et al., 2017; 28194436); other mutations at this position are predicted to behave similarly. BRAF V600E has been reported in 0.6_6% of GBM samples (Basto et al., 2005; 15791479, Knobbe et al., 2004; 15517309, Schindler et al., 2011; 21274720, Dias_Santagata et al., 2011; 21479234, Chi et al., 2012; 22821383), with one study reporting BRAF V600E in 54% (7/13) of epithelioid glioblastomas (Kleinschmidt_DeMasters et al., 2013; 23552385). BRAF mutation has been detected in 60_89% of patients with pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) and, additionally, has been reported in patients with GBM arising from PXA (Dias_Santagata et al., 2011; 21479234, Tanaka et al., 2014; 24894018, Ma et al., 2018; 30240866, Phillips et al., 2018; 30051528). Various studies have implicated BRAF alterations, including V600E and rearrangements, in the oncogenesis of pediatric low grade astrocytomas, including gangliogliomas (Rodriguez et al., 2013; 23121055, Gronych et al., 2011; 21403401, Koelsche et al., 2013; 23822828, Nicolaides et al., 2011; 22038996, Huillard et al., 2012; 22586120, Dahiya et al., 2012; 22548077, Korshunov et al., 2009; 19543740, Schindler et al., 2011; 21274720, Donson et al., 2014; 24238153, Dougherty et al., 2010; 20156809). BRAF alterations have been reported in 1_3% of gliomas including low grade gliomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751, Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Basto et al., 2005; 15791479, Chi et al., 2012; 22821383, Knobbe et al., 2004; 15517309, Schindler et al., 2011; 21274720) and glioblastomas (GBM)(cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). Studies have reported conflicting results as to whether BRAF mutations, including V600E, are more likely to be found in lower grade astrocytomas or higher grade glioblastomas (Basto et al., 2005; 15791479, Schindler et al., 2011; 21274720, Horbinski et al., 2012; 22492957), and the frequency of the BRAF V600E mutation in astrocytoma reported in the literature varies by cohort (Bannykh et al., 2014; 25066317, Theeler et al., 2014; 24470550, Chapp\u00e9 et al., 2013; 23442159). BRAF V600E is not strongly associated with prognosis in patients with astrocytoma (Bannykh et al., 2014; 25066317, Chapp\u00e9 et al., 2013; 23442159). While one study associated KIAA1549_BRAF fusion with improved prognosis in pediatric patients with low grade astrocytomas (Hawkins et al., 2011; 21610142), others reported no significant association between BRAF rearrangements and outcome (Colin et al., 2013; 23278243, Jones et al., 2008; 18974108, Lin et al., 2012; 22157620, Horbinski et al., 2010; 20044755). Patients with BRAF V600_mutated gliomas have benefited from the combination of BRAF V600_inhibitor dabrafenib and MEK_inhibitor trametinib (Geoerger et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 10506, Subbiah et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT025). In low_grade glioma cohorts, ORRs of 25_69% (9/36 and 9/13) were reported in pediatric and adult patients, respectively (Geoerger et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 10506, Subbiah et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT025). For patients with high_grade glioma, including glioblastoma, the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib elicited an ORR of 33% (15/45) and median OS of 17.6 months (Subbiah et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT025). Patients with BRAF V600_mutated glioma have also benefited from treatment with BRAF V600_inhibitor dabrafenib or vemurafenib monotherapies with ORRs of 44% (14/32) and 25% (6/24), respectively (Hargrave et al., 2019; 31811016, Subbiah et al., 2020; 32029534, Kaley et al., 2018; 30351999). In smaller studies, pediatric patients with BRAF V600E_mutated pilocytic astrocytoma have responded to the MEK_inhibitor selumetinib (29% PR, 2/7) (Fangusaro et al., 2019; 31151904), and patients with BRAF V600_mutated brain tumors have benefited from the combination of vemurafenib and mTOR inhibitor everolimus (60% DCR, 2 PR and 1 SD) (Sen et al., 2020; 32843426). In a Phase 1/2 basket trial of the second_generation BRAF_inhibitor PLX8394 in combination with cobicistat, all 3 patients with BRAF V600E_mutated glioma achieved a PR (Janku et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract CT212). In 2 Phase 1 studies evaluating the MEK_pan_RAF dual inhibitor CH5126766, 3 patients harboring BRAF V600E mutations experienced PRs, including 2 patients with melanoma (Martinez_Garcia et al., 2012; 22761467) and 1 patient with low_grade serous ovarian carcinoma (Guo et al., 2020; 3312887).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "BRAF activating alterations may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of BRAF, MEK, or ERK.

Dabrafenib can induce adverse effects such as the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and keratoacanthomas caused by inactivation of wildtype BRAF that leads to paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway, but it has been reported to be well tolerated in patients with BRAF V600E_mutated thyroid cancer (Gibney et al., 2013; 23712190, Hauschild et al., 2012; 22735384, Falchook et al., 2015; 25285888). Patients with melanoma harboring BRAF V600E or V600K mutation treated with a combination of dabrafenib and trametinib experienced significantly lower rates of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and regression of established BRAF inhibitor_induced skin lesions (Flaherty et al., 2012; 23020132, Long et al., 2014; 25265492, Peters et al., 2014; 25185693, Long et al., 2015; 26037941, Roberts et al., 2015; 25399551). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Selumetinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Selumetinib is a MEK inhibitor that is FDA approved to treat pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) who have symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PNs).

A Phase 2 study of selumetinib for patients with low_grade glioma (LGG) reported 8/25 PRs for patients with BRAF alterations and 10/25 PRs for those with NF1_associated LGG (Fangusaro et al., 2019; 31151904); a Phase 1 study of selumetinib reported 5/25 PRs for patients with LGG (Banerjee et al., 2017; 28339824). A Phase 2 study of selumetinib for patients with tumors with activating alterations in the MAPK pathway evaluated 8 patients with high_grade glioma (HGG); 2 SDs and no objective responses were observed in this subset (Allen et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 10008). Selumetinib has demonstrated efficacy in NF1_associated neurofibroma in Phase 2 studies (Schalkwijk et al., 2021; 33903938, Glassberg et al., 2020; ASPHO Abstract 2015, Coyne et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 3612) and a Phase 1 study (Dombi et al., 2016; 28029918). Phase 2 studies reported clinical responses in low_grade glioma (Fangusaro et al., 2019; 31151904, Banerjee et al., 2017; 28339824), melanoma (Gupta et al., 2014; 24567366, Robert et al., 2013; 23735514, Kirkwood et al., 2012; 22048237, Banerji et al., 2010; 20179232, Boers_Sonderen et al., 2012; 22293660), and in lung (Lopez_Chavez et al., 2015; 25667274, Hainsworth et al., 2010; 20802351, Middleton et al., 2020; 32669708) and endometrial cancer (Coleman et al., 2015; 25887099). A Phase 2 study of selumetinib for patients with activating alterations in the MAPK pathway reported a DCR of 15% (3/20), with no objective responses observed (Allen et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 10008). Phase 1 studies of selumetinib to treat patients with solid tumors reported 1/15 PR for a patient with colorectal cancer (CRC) and 5/15 SDs for patients with tonsil squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and CRC (Deming et al., 2016; 26666244); 2/39 PRs (for patients with CRC) and 18/39 SDs were achieved when selumetinib was administered in combination with cyclosporin A (Krishnamurthy et al., 2018; 30042150). Multiple Phase 1 studies combining selumetinib with erlotinib or temsirolimus (Infante et al., 2017; 28424891), docetaxel or dacarbazine (LoRusso et al., 2017; 28264648), AKT inhibitors (Tolcher et al., 2015; 25516890), or cixutumumab (an anti_IGF_1R antibody)(Wilky et al., 2015; 25268371) reported clinical responses for patients with advanced solid tumors including NSCLC, thyroid carcinoma, tongue SCC, and ovarian cancer. </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT03239015", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04803318", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03284502", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04391595", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03905148", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03973918", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT01989585", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04965818", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02428712", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "CDKN2A/B", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": [{"Name": "CDKN2A loss", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "CDKN2A loss"}}, "Interpretation": "CDKN2A encodes two different, unrelated tumor suppressor proteins, p16INK4a and p14ARF, whereas CDKN2B encodes the tumor suppressor p15INK4b (Quelle et al., 1995; 8521522, Sharpless, 2005; 15878778). Both p15INK4b and p16INK4a bind to and inhibit CDK4 and CDK6, thereby maintaining the growth_suppressive activity of the Rb tumor suppressor; loss or inactivation of either p15INK4b or p16INK4a contributes to dysregulation of the CDK4/6_cyclin_Rb pathway and loss of cell cycle control (Gazzeri et al., 1998; 9484839, Roussel, 1999; 10498883). The tumor suppressive functions of p14ARF involve stabilization and activation of p53, via a mechanism of MDM2 inhibition (Sherr et al., 2005; 16869746, Ozenne et al., 2010; 20549699). One or more alterations observed here are predicted to result in p16INK4a loss of function (Ruas et al., 1999; 10498896, Jones et al., 2007; 17909018, Haferkamp et al., 2008; 18843795, Huot et al., 2002; 12417717, Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Gombart et al., 1997; 9324288, Yang et al., 1995; 7780957, Parry and Peters, 1996; 8668202, Greenblatt et al., 2003; 12606942, Yarbrough et al., 1999; 10491434, Poi et al., 2001; 11255261, Byeon et al., 1998; 9660926, Kannengiesser et al., 2009; 19260062, Lal et al., 2000; 10719365, Koh et al., 1995; 7777061, McKenzie et al., 2010; 20340136, Miller et al., 2011; 21462282, Arap et al., 1997; 905385, Scaini et al., 2014; 24659262, Jenkins et al., 2013; 23190892, Walker et al., 1999; 10389768, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). One or more alterations seen here are predicted to result in p14ARF loss of function (Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Itahana and Zhang, 2008; 18538737, Zhang and Xiong, 1999; 10360174, Zhang et al., 1998; 9529249, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). CDKN2B alterations such as seen here are predicted to inactivate p15INK4b (Jafri et al., 2015; 25873077). Concurrent putative homozygous deletion of CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been reported in 35% of patients with gliomas (cBio_Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661) and detected more frequently in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; 58%)(cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142) than in those with lower grade gliomas (13%) (cBioPortal, Sep 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). In other studies, loss of CDKN2A/B by deletion has been reported in up to 78% of astrocytomas (including anaplastic astrocytomas and GBM) (Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Weber et al., 2007; 16909113). A study found homozygous deletion of both p16INK4a and p14ARF in 26% (13/50) of glioblastomas (GBMs); 18% (9/50) of cases showed homozygous deletion of the p14ARF_encoding locus alone (Nakamura et al., 2001; 11303791). One study detected CDKN2A/B loss in 69% (161/232) and mutation in 2.6% (6/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Decreased p14ARF and p16INK4a expression levels were found to be tightly associated in a study of glioma samples (Chakravarti et al., 2001; 11489817). Homozygous deletion of the genomic region including CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been found to be associated with poor prognosis in GBM and likely serves as an early event in GBM progression (Feng et al., 2012; 21713760, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337). In addition, expression of p16INK4a has been found to be lower in patients with high grade malignant gliomas compared to patients with low grade gliomas, and loss of p16INK4a expression has been associated with shorter overall survival in pilocytic astrocytomas (Raabe et al., 2011; 21636552, Liu et al., 2011; 21843312). Preclinical data suggest that tumors with loss of p16INK4a function may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, ribociclib, and palbociclib (Konecny et al., 2011; 21278246, Katsumi et al., 2011; 21871868, Cen et al., 2012; 22711607, Logan et al., 2013; 23898052). Although case studies have reported that patients with breast cancer or uterine leiomyosarcoma harboring CDKN2A loss responded to palbociclib treatment (Elvin et al., 2017; 28283584, Gao et al., 2015; 26715889), multiple other clinical studies have shown no significant correlation between p16INK4a loss or inactivation and therapeutic benefit of these agents (Gopalan et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8077, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Konecny et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5557)(DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Johnson et al., 2014; 24797823); it is not known whether CDK4/6 inhibitors would be beneficial in this case. Although preclinical studies have suggested that loss of p14ARF function may be associated with reduced sensitivity to MDM2 inhibitors (Van Maerken et al., 2011; 21460101, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357), the clinical relevance of p14ARF as a predictive biomarker is not clear. There are no drugs that directly target the mutation or loss of CDKN2B in cancer. Because the p15INK4b protein encoded by CDKN2B is known to inhibit CDK4, tumors with CDKN2B mutation or loss may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as ribociclib, abemaciclib, and palbociclib (Infante et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 2528, Shapiro et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 2500)(Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126). Germline CDKN2A mutation is associated with melanoma_pancreatic cancer syndrome, a condition marked by increased risk of developing malignant melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer (Whelan et al., 1995; 7666917). Mutation carriers within families may develop either or both types of cancer, and melanoma cases may be referred to as familial or hereditary melanoma (Hansson, 2010; 20687502, Hogg et al., 1998; 9479083). CDKN2A is the most implicated gene in familial melanoma, with germline mutations present in 16% to 20% of familial melanoma cases (De Unamuno et al., 2018; 29543703, Soura et al., 2016; 26892650, Huerta et al., 2018; 29405243). CDKN2A alteration has also been implicated in familial melanoma_astrocytoma syndrome, an extremely rare tumor association characterized by dual predisposition to melanoma and nervous system tumors (Kaufman et al., 1993; 8414022, Bahuau et al., 1998; 9622062, Chan et al., 2017; 28699883).

Dysregulation of JAK_STAT signaling has been implicated in a variety of epithelial tumors (Levine, 2012; 21823028). However, JAK_STAT signaling is required for the antiviral and antiproliferative effects of interferons (Pansky et al., 2000; 10699955). Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. In the TCGA datasets, JAK1 mutation or amplification was observed in ~1% of glioblastoma cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142) and was not observed in any lower grade gliomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751). A study of 96 glioma patients reported increased levels of JAK1 protein, and JAK1 phosphorylation was higher in glioma samples than in normal brain tissue (Tu et al., 2011; 20135364). High levels of JAK1 protein were correlated with poor prognosis in glioma patients (Tu et al., 2011; 20135364). Inhibitors of the JAK_STAT pathway are under development. The JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib is approved to treat myelofibrosis, and has shown efficacy in reducing symptoms in Phase 1 and 2 trials in patients with myeloproliferative disorders (Verstovsek et al., 2013; 23480528, Naqvi et al., 2011; 21635221, Verstovsek et al., 2012; 22718840). Other small molecule inhibitors of JAK1 are being investigated in preclinical studies in some types of solid tumors (Swiatek_Machado et al., 2012; 22555804, Yan et al., 2013; 23531921). HSP90 inhibitors are also being investigated in preclinical studies to target components of the JAK_STAT pathway such as JAK1 (Wang et al., 2010; 21154128).

Decreased expression of MTAP leads to MTA accumulation within tumor cells and their microenvironment (Kirovski et al., 2011; 21356366, Limm et al., 2013; 23265702, Stevens et al., 2009; 19097084), thereby reducing intracellular arginine methylation (Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473, Mavrakis et al., 2016; 26912361, Kryukov et al., 2016; 26912360) and altering cell signaling (Limm et al., 2014; 25087184, Stevens et al., 2009; 19097084). MTAP is located at 9p21, adjacent to CDKN2A and CDKN2B, with which it is frequently co_deleted in various cancers. Other alterations in MTAP are rare and have not been extensively characterized. MTAP loss/homozygous deletion as well as loss of expression has been reported in a wide variety of solid tumors and hematologic cancers (Wei et al., 2016; 27929028, Zhao and Zhao, 2016; 27556634); such events have been correlated with poor prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (Kirovski et al., 2011; 21356366), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (Huang et al., 2009; 19887491), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)(Marce et al., 2006; 16778103), melanoma (Meyer et al., 2010; 20500769, Wild et al., 2006; 16618867), gastric cancer (Kim et al., 2011; 21412930), myxofibrosarcoma (Li et al., 2014; 25426549), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (He et al., 2015; 26656376), ovarian carcinoma (Wei et al., 2016; 27929028) and non_small cell lung cancer (Su et al., 2014; 24969958). MTAP loss was not prognostic in pediatric B_cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (Mirebeau et al., 2006; 16818274) or in astrocytoma (Becker et al., 2015; 26088413). However, MTAP has also been reported to be overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (Snezhkina et al., 2016; 27433286), and MTAP retention is thought to be important for prostate cancer growth due to continuous supply of SAM (Bistulfi et al., 2016; 26910893). Germline SNPs in MTAP have been correlated with the development of cutaneous melanoma (Antonopoulou et al., 2015; 25407435, Mccioni et al., 2013; 23816148), esophageal cancer (Hyland et al., 2016; 26635288, Lin et al., 2017; 27960044), osteosarcoma (Zhi et al., 2016; 27994653), and CRC (Gu et al., 2013; 23361049). Preclinical and limited clinical evidence indicate that MTAP inactivation produces specific metabolic vulnerabilities. MTAP inactivation may confer sensitivity to MAT2A inhibitors (Heist et al., 2019; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract B116, Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473). A Phase 1 trial of MAT2A inhibitor AG_270 reported 1 PR and 2 SDs lasting longer than 6 months for patients with advanced solid tumors displaying MTAP loss (Heist et al., 2019; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract B116). Although preclinical data have suggested that MTAP loss sensitizes cells to PRMT5 inhibition (Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473, Mavrakis et al., 2016; 26912361, Kryukov et al., 2016; 2691236), MTAP loss may not be a biomarker of response to previously developed small_molecule SAM_uncompetitive PRMT5 inhibitors (Guccione and Richard, 2019; 31350521); dual PRMT1 and PRMT5 inhibition may be more effective (Fedoriw et al., 2019; 31257072, Srour et al., 2019; 31287990, Gao et al., 2019; 30916320). In preclinical cancer models, MTAP inactivation showed increased sensitivity to inhibitors of purine synthesis or purine analogs, especially upon addition of exogenous MTA, which is converted to adenine in normal cells, thereby providing competition to purine poisons lacking in MTAP_deficient cells (Hansen et al., 2019; 31040154, Tang et al., 2018; 29844120, Munshi et al., 2014; 24928612, de Oliveira et al., 2016; 26751376, Lubin and Lubin, 2009; 19478948, Tang et al., 2012; 22825330, Collins et al., 2012; 22252602, Bertino et al., 2011; 21301207, Coulthard et al., 2011; 21282358, Miyazaki et al., 2007; 17912432, Efferth et al., 2002; 11987241). A Phase 2 study of L_alanosine, an inhibitor of adenine synthesis, as a monotherapy for 65 patients with MTAP_deficient cancers reported no responses and stable disease in 23.6% (13/55) of patients (Kindler et al., 2009; 18618081).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). Low_level MSI has been reported in 5_9% of glioblastoma (GBM) samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927, Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285, Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). A large_scale study did not find high_level microsatellite instability (MSI_H) in any of 129 GBM samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), although a small_scale study reported MSI_H in 4 of 15 pediatric GBMs and 1 of 12 adult GBMs (Szybka et al., 2003; 12908754). The frequency of MSI has been reported to be increased in relapsed compared to primary GBM (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), in GBMs with a previous lower grade astrocytoma (Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285), and in giant cell GBM compared to classic GBM (Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "SETD2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Y2312*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Y2312*"}}, "Interpretation": "SETD2 encodes a histone lysine_36 methyltransferase (Sun et al., 2005; 16118227) that preferentially interacts with the expanded N_terminal polyglutamine tracts present in mutant huntingtin, implicating it in the pathogenesis of Huntington disease (Faber et al., 1998; 9700202). SETD2 mRNA expression has been observed to be consistently reduced in breast tumors relative to adjacent non_tumor tissue, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role (Al Sarakbi et al., 2009; 19698110). SETD2 alterations such as observed here have been shown to be inactivating (Parker et al., 2016; 27282254, Zhang et al., 2012; 22237106, McKinney et al., 2017; 28122867, Moffitt et al., 2017; 28424246, Zhu et al., 2014; 24509477, Lu et al., 2016; 27174990). Somatic inactivating alterations of SETD2 are documented to occur at low frequency in a number of solid tumors, most commonly in renal carcinoma (Varela et al., 2011; 21248752). SETD2 has been associated with favorable prognosis in gastric cancer (Chen et al., 2018; 29522714). SETD2 has also been associated with poor prognosis in RCC and MDS (Chen et al., 2020; 32202636, Liu et al.,; 2015; 26559293), while data in other tumor types is limited (PubMed, Jun 2021).

TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Touat et al., 2020; 32322066, Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556, Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642). Glioblastoma (GBM) harbors a median TMB of 2.7 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 4.2% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). For pediatric patients, high TMB has been reported in a subset of high_grade gliomas, frequently in association with mutations in mismatch repair or proofreading genes and in TP53, whereas BRAF alterations or other oncogene fusions were observed more frequently in brain tumors harboring low TMB (Patel et al., 2020; 32386112, Johnson et al., 2017; 28912153). Increased TMB has been reported to correlate with higher tumor grade in glioma (Draaisma et al., 2015; 26699864) and glioblastoma (GBM) tissue samples with biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD) (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570), as well as with shorter OS of patients with diffuse glioma (Wang et al., 2020; 32164609). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In glioma, a lack of association between TMB and clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors has been reported (Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Touat et al., 2020; 32322066). However, multiple case studies have reported that patients with ultramutated gliomas driven by POLE mutations have benefited from treatment with anti_PD_1 (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556) or anti_PD_L1 (Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642) therapies.
