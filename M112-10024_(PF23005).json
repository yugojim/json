Alterations such as seen here may disrupt NF2 function or expression (Laulajainen et al., 2012; 22325036, Lallemand et al., 2009; 19910496, Sherman et al., 2007; 9395247, Li et al., 2012; 22482125, Manetti et al., 2012; 23213372, Stokowski et al., 2000; 10712203, Mani et al., 2011; 21402777). NF2 alterations have been reported in 1.4% of renal non_clear cell carcinoma and 0.9% of kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (Durinck et al., 2015; 25401301, Creighton et al., 2013; 23792563). Truncating mutations in NF2 have been reported in ccRCC, with one study reporting NF2 truncating mutations in 4% of samples (Dalgliesh et al., 2010; 20054297, Staller, 2010; 20528227). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of NF2 alterations in renal cell carcinoma are limited (PubMed, Jul 2022). NF2 inactivating alterations may indicate sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors (Lopez_Lago et al., 2009; 19451229, James et al., 2009; 19451225, Pachow et al., 2013; 23406776, Iyer et al., 2012; 22923433). Two case studies reported clinical benefit for patients with NF2_mutated cancers, including urothelial carcinoma (Ali et al., 2015; 25630452) and metaplastic breast cancer (Ganesan et al., 2014; 25253784, Moulder et al., 2015; 25878190) treated with everolimus and temsirolimus, respectively. Loss or inactivation of NF2 may also predict sensitivity to FAK inhibitors based on clinical data in mesothelioma (Soria et al., 2016; 27733373) and meningioma (Brastianos et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 2502) and strong preclinical data (Poulikakos et al., 2006; 16652148, Shapiro et al., 2014; 24848258, Shah et al., 2014; 24786638). Limited preclinical and clinical evidence in vestibular schwannoma suggests possible sensitivity of NF2_deficient tumors to the pan_ERBB inhibitor lapatinib (Ammoun et al., 2010; 20511180, Karajannis et al., 2012; 22844108). Similarly, on the basis of limited clinical (Subbiah et al., 2011; ASCO Abstract 2100) and preclinical (Garcia_Rendueles et al., 2015; 26359368, Ammoun et al., 2008; 18593924, Yi et al., 2011; 21481793) evidence, NF2 inactivation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, such as approved agents trametinib and cobimetinib. These and other relevant compounds are being investigated in clinical trials. Whereas frequent adverse events precluded a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for the combination of trametinib and everolimus in a Phase 1b trial for solid tumors (Tolcher et al., 2014; 25344362), a retrospective study for heavily pretreated patients with solid tumors reported tolerable regimens of the combination for 23/31 patients, with 16 patients treated >3 months and evaluable patients achieving a median PFS of 6.5 months (Patterson et al., 2018; AACR Abstract 3891). Heterozygous germline NF2 loss or inactivation is associated with neurofibromatosis type 2, which results in the development of vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas, ependymomas, and ocular disturbances (Evans et al., 2011; 21358190, Lu_Emerson and Plotkin, 2009; 19898272, Asthagiri et al., 2009; 19476995). Prevalence for this disorder in the general population is estimated to be 1:25,000 (Asthagiri et al., 2009; 19476995). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of NF2 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Inactivation or loss of NF2 results in the dysregulation of mTOR and FAK pathway signaling.

TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB level that may be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors in multiple solid tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). Kidney carcinoma, including renal clear cell carcinoma, renal papillary carcinoma, and renal sarcomatoid carcinoma subtypes, harbors a median TMB of 2.7 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 0_2% of cases have been reported to harbor high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421, Pal et al., 2018; 28592388). Renal cell carcinomas harbor an average TMB among solid tumors, with a median of approximately 1_2 non_synonymous somatic mutations per megabase in kidney clear_cell or papillary carcinoma (Lawrence et al., 2013; 23770567, Alexandrov et al., 2013; 23945592). For patients with ccRCC, increased TMB is associated with poor survival outcomes, higher tumor grade, and advanced pathological stage (Zhang et al., 2019; 31930049). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, increased tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Ott et al., 2019; 30557521, Cristescu et al., 2022; 35101941, Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). In the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors, significant improvement in ORR was observed for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) compared with those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526); similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). At the same TMB cutpoint, retrospective analysis of patients with solid tumors treated with any checkpoint inhibitor identified that tissue TMB scores \u2265 10 Muts/Mb were associated with prolonged time to treatment failure compared with scores <10 muts/Mb (HR=0.68) (Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). For patients with solid tumors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the CheckMate 848 trial, improved responses were observed in patients with a tissue TMB \u2265 10 Muts/Mb independent of blood TMB at any cutpoint in matched samples (Schenker at al., 2022; AACR Abstract 7845). However, support for higher TMB thresholds and efficacy was observed in the prospective Phase 2 MyPathway trial of atezolizumab for patients with pan_solid tumors, where improved ORR and DCR was seen in patients with TMB \u2265 16 Muts/Mb than those with TMB \u2265 10 and <16 Muts/Mb (Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409). Similarly, analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Increased tumor mutational burden may predict response to anti_PD_1 (alone or in combination with anti_CTLA_4) or anti_PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Pembrolizumab", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD_1 receptor and blocks its interaction with the ligands PD_L1 and PD_L2 to enhance antitumor immune responses.

An association between higher TMB and improved OS, median PFS, and ORR has been observed in large pan_solid tumor studies for patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> In the Phase 2 KEYNOTE 158 multi_solid tumor trial, treatment with the PD_1 inhibitor pembrolizumab led to improved ORR for patients with TMB of 10 Muts/Mb or higher compared those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb (28.3% [34/120] vs. 6.5% [41/635])(Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526). In the KEYNOTE 028/012 pan_solid tumor trials, a similar improvement in ORR was reported for patients with >103 non_synonymous mutations/exome (~ equivalency >8 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) compared to those with <103 non_synonymous mutations/exome (30.6% [11/36] vs. 6.5% [5/77])(Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). In the KEYNOTE_427 Phase 2 study, first_line pembrolizumab elicited a 36% ORR, 58% DCR, and 7.1_month median PFS (mPFS) for patients with advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and a 27% ORR, 43% DCR, and 4.2_month mPFS for patients with advanced non_clear cell RCC. Anti_tumor activity was seen for favorable_ and intermediate_ and/or poor_risk groups, PD_L1_positive and _negative groups, and patients with sarcomatoid histology (McDermott et al., 2021; 33529051, McDermott et al., 2021; 33529058). In the adjuvant setting for treatment_naive ccRCC, single_agent pembrolizumab improved disease_free survival compared with placebo (HR=0.68) in interim analysis of KEYNOTE_564 (Choueiri et al., 2021; 34407342). In Phase 3 studies, the combination of pembrolizumab with multi_TKIs such as lenvatinib or axitinib has significantly improved outcomes for patients with previously untreated ccRCC as compared with sunitinib monotherapy; CLEAR demonstrated an ORR of 71% vs 36% and improved mPFS (23.3 vs. 9.2 months, HR=0.42) and median OS (mOS; not reached for either arm, HR=0.72) for pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib (Motzer et al., 2021; 33616314, Porta et al., 2022; ESMO Abstract 1449MO), and KEYNOTE_426 showed improved mPFS (15.4 vs. 11.1 months, HR=0.71) and mOS (not reached vs. 35.7 months, HR=0.68) for pembrolizumab plus axitinib (Powles et al., 2020; 33284113, Rini et al., 2019; 30779529). The KEYNOTE_146 Phase 1b/2 study of lenvatinib combined with pembrolizumab also demonstrated an ORR of 77% (17/22) for treatment_naive patients with metastatic RCC compared with 41% (7/17) for patients previously treated with non_immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies and 56% (58/104) for patients who had relapsed on prior treatment with an ICI (Lee et al., 2021; 34143969). For patients with non_clear cell RCC, the Phase 2 KEYNOTE_B61 study of frontline pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib preliminarily reported an ORR of 48% (39/82) and a DCR of 79% (65/82)(Albiges et al., 2022; ESMO Abstract 1448O). Although anti_tumor activity was also reported for frontline pembrolizumab with the multi_TKI pazopanib in a Phase 1/2 trial for advanced ccRCC, due to significant hepatotoxicity the combination was not recommended for further clinical investigation (Chowdhury et al., 2021; 34006498). Early phase trials have reported activity of pembrolizumab in combination with the CTLA_4_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab, pegylated interferon alfa 2b, or the IL_10_targeting monoclonal antibody pegilodecakin in previously treated RCC (Atkins et al., 2018; 29358500, Tannir et al., 2021; 33709428, Naing et al., 2019; 31563517). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Avelumab", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Avelumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to PD_L1 and blocks its interaction with PD_1 in order to enhance antitumor immune responses.

Heterozygous germline inactivation of CDC73 has additionally been suggested to be a predisposing factor for PC (Shattuck et al., 2003; 14585940).

Both p15INK4b and p16INK4a bind to and inhibit CDK4 and CDK6, thereby maintaining the growth_suppressive activity of the Rb tumor suppressor; loss or inactivation of either p15INK4b or p16INK4a contributes to dysregulation of the CDK4/6_cyclin_Rb pathway and loss of cell cycle control (Gazzeri et al., 1998; 9484839, Roussel, 1999; 10498883). The tumor suppressive functions of p14ARF involve stabilization and activation of p53, via a mechanism of MDM2 inhibition (Sherr et al., 2005; 16869746, Ozenne et al., 2010; 20549699).

One or more alterations seen here are predicted to result in p14ARF loss of function (Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Itahana and Zhang, 2008; 18538737, Zhang and Xiong, 1999; 10360174, Zhang et al., 1998; 9529249, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). CDKN2B alterations such as seen here are predicted to inactivate p15INK4b (Jafri et al., 2015; 25873077). In the Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) and Kidney Renal Papillary Cell Carcinoma TCGA datasets, putative homozygous deletion of both the CDKN2A and CDKN2B genes has been reported in 4.5% and 3% of cases, respectively (cBioPortal, Jul 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). CDKN2A/B deletion has been reported to be one of the most significant copy number alterations in ccRCC (Girgis et al., 2012; 22926558). In a study of sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma (RCC), CDKN2A alterations were reported in 27% (7/26) of cases, with CDKN2B also altered in 15% (4/26) of these samples (Malouf et al., 2016; 26895810). One study has reported loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on 9p21, which includes the region that encodes CDKN2A and CDKN2B, in 25% of papillary renal cell carcinoma tumors (Maestro et al., 2000; 11037653). Loss due to deletion or hypermethylation of chromosome 9p, which includes the CDKN2A and CDKN2B loci, has been reported at frequencies ranging from 13% to 80% of renal cell carcinoma samples, including ccRCC and papillary subtypes, and has been associated with poor prognosis (Toma et al., 2008; 18592004, Klatte et al., 2009; 19124809, Gunawan et al., 2003; 14559804, Onay et al., 2009; 19641369, Sanz_Casla et al., 2003; 12883879). In addition, loss of chromosome 9p has been associated with advanced tumor grade, disease progression, and overall poor prognosis in both ccRCC and papillary renal cell carcinoma (Klatte et al., 2009; 19124809, Grady et al., 2001; 11490304, Gunawan et al., 2003; 14559804). Preclinical data suggest that tumors with loss of p16INK4a function may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, ribociclib, and palbociclib (Konecny et al., 2011; 21278246, Katsumi et al., 2011; 21871868, Cen et al., 2012; 22711607, Logan et al., 2013; 23898052). Clinical data in mesothelioma, breast cancer, and uterine leiomyosarcoma indicate that CDKN2A loss may predict sensitivity to abemaciclib (Fennell et al., 2022; 35157829) and palbociclib treatment (Elvin et al., 2017; 28283584, Gao et al., 2015; 26715889). However, multiple other clinical studies have shown no significant correlation between p16INK4a loss or inactivation and therapeutic benefit of these agents (Gopalan et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8077, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Konecny et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5557)(DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Johnson et al., 2014; 24797823); it is not known whether CDK4/6 inhibitors would be beneficial in this case. Although preclinical studies have suggested that loss of p14ARF function may be associated with reduced sensitivity to MDM2 inhibitors (Van Maerken et al., 2011; 21460101, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357), the clinical relevance of p14ARF as a predictive biomarker is not clear. The p15INK4b protein encoded by CDKN2B is known to inhibit CDK4, and although concomitant loss of CDKN2A and CDKN2B may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as ribociclib, abemaciclib, and palbociclib (Infante et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 2528, Shapiro et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 2500, Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126), direct supporting data for CDKN2B alteration as a predictive biomarker for these therapies are limited (Su et al., 2019; 31700061, Tramontana et al., 2020; 32923894). Germline CDKN2A mutation is associated with melanoma_pancreatic cancer syndrome, a condition marked by increased risk of developing malignant melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer (Whelan et al., 1995; 7666917). Mutation carriers within families may develop either or both types of cancer, and melanoma cases may be referred to as familial or hereditary melanoma (Hansson, 2010; 20687502, Hogg et al., 1998; 9479083). CDKN2A is the most implicated gene in familial melanoma, with germline mutations present in 16% to 20% of familial melanoma cases (De Unamuno et al., 2018; 29543703, Soura et al., 2016; 26892650, Huerta et al., 2018; 29405243). CDKN2A alteration has also been implicated in familial melanoma_astrocytoma syndrome, an extremely rare tumor association characterized by dual predisposition to melanoma and nervous system tumors (Kaufman et al., 1993; 8414022, Bahuau et al., 1998; 9622062, Chan et al., 2017; 28699883). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of CDKN2A is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}, {"Name": "CDKN2A loss", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "CDKN2A loss"}}, "Interpretation": "CDKN2A encodes two different, unrelated tumor suppressor proteins, p16INK4a and p14ARF, whereas CDKN2B encodes the tumor suppressor p15INK4b (Quelle et al., 1995; 8521522, Sharpless, 2005; 15878778). Both p15INK4b and p16INK4a bind to and inhibit CDK4 and CDK6, thereby maintaining the growth_suppressive activity of the Rb tumor suppressor; loss or inactivation of either p15INK4b or p16INK4a contributes to dysregulation of the CDK4/6_cyclin_Rb pathway and loss of cell cycle control (Gazzeri et al., 1998; 9484839, Roussel, 1999; 10498883). The tumor suppressive functions of p14ARF involve stabilization and activation of p53, via a mechanism of MDM2 inhibition (Sherr et al., 2005; 16869746, Ozenne et al., 2010; 20549699). One or more alterations observed here are predicted to result in p16INK4a loss of function (Ruas et al., 1999; 10498896, Jones et al., 2007; 17909018, Haferkamp et al., 2008; 18843795, Huot et al., 2002; 12417717, Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Gombart et al., 1997; 9324288, Yang et al., 1995; 7780957, Parry and Peters, 1996; 8668202, Greenblatt et al., 2003; 12606942, Yarbrough et al., 1999; 10491434, Poi et al., 2001; 11255261, Byeon et al., 1998; 9660926, Kannengiesser et al., 2009; 19260062, Lal et al., 2000; 10719365, Koh et al., 1995; 7777061, McKenzie et al., 2010; 20340136, Miller et al., 2011; 21462282, Arap et al., 1997; 905385, Scaini et al., 2014; 24659262, Jenkins et al., 2013; 23190892, Walker et al., 1999; 10389768, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). One or more alterations seen here are predicted to result in p14ARF loss of function (Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Itahana and Zhang, 2008; 18538737, Zhang and Xiong, 1999; 10360174, Zhang et al., 1998; 9529249, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). CDKN2B alterations such as seen here are predicted to inactivate p15INK4b (Jafri et al., 2015; 25873077). In the Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) and Kidney Renal Papillary Cell Carcinoma TCGA datasets, putative homozygous deletion of both the CDKN2A and CDKN2B genes has been reported in 4.5% and 3% of cases, respectively (cBioPortal, Jul 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). CDKN2A/B deletion has been reported to be one of the most significant copy number alterations in ccRCC (Girgis et al., 2012; 22926558). In a study of sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma (RCC), CDKN2A alterations were reported in 27% (7/26) of cases, with CDKN2B also altered in 15% (4/26) of these samples (Malouf et al., 2016; 26895810). One study has reported loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on 9p21, which includes the region that encodes CDKN2A and CDKN2B, in 25% of papillary renal cell carcinoma tumors (Maestro et al., 2000; 11037653). Loss due to deletion or hypermethylation of chromosome 9p, which includes the CDKN2A and CDKN2B loci, has been reported at frequencies ranging from 13% to 80% of renal cell carcinoma samples, including ccRCC and papillary subtypes, and has been associated with poor prognosis (Toma et al., 2008; 18592004, Klatte et al., 2009; 19124809, Gunawan et al., 2003; 14559804, Onay et al., 2009; 19641369, Sanz_Casla et al., 2003; 12883879). In addition, loss of chromosome 9p has been associated with advanced tumor grade, disease progression, and overall poor prognosis in both ccRCC and papillary renal cell carcinoma (Klatte et al., 2009; 19124809, Grady et al., 2001; 11490304, Gunawan et al., 2003; 14559804). Preclinical data suggest that tumors with loss of p16INK4a function may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, ribociclib, and palbociclib (Konecny et al., 2011; 21278246, Katsumi et al., 2011; 21871868, Cen et al., 2012; 22711607, Logan et al., 2013; 23898052). Clinical data in mesothelioma, breast cancer, and uterine leiomyosarcoma indicate that CDKN2A loss may predict sensitivity to abemaciclib (Fennell et al., 2022; 35157829) and palbociclib treatment (Elvin et al., 2017; 28283584, Gao et al., 2015; 26715889). However, multiple other clinical studies have shown no significant correlation between p16INK4a loss or inactivation and therapeutic benefit of these agents (Gopalan et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8077, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Konecny et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5557)(DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Johnson et al., 2014; 24797823); it is not known whether CDK4/6 inhibitors would be beneficial in this case.

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI_high and MSI_low were each reported in 1% of cases in a study of 152 renal cell carcinomas (RCC) (Stoehr et al., 2012; 22378480). Another study reported that fewer than 1% of RCC cases had MSI_H status (Bratslavsky et al., 2021; 33775530). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of MSI in RCC are limited (PubMed, Jan 2023). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "NOTCH3", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "K603*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "19.91", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "K603*"}}, "Interpretation": "NOTCH3 encodes a member of the NOTCH family of receptors, which are involved in cell fate determination and various developmental processes. Upon binding of membrane_bound ligands, NOTCH signaling involves cleavage of the NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD), which subsequently forms part of a transcription factor complex that regulates downstream target genes (Penton et al., 2012; 22306179, Kopan and Ilagan, 2009; 19379690). Alterations that disrupt or remove the transmembrane domain (amino acids 1644_1664), RAM domain (amino acids 1665_1837), and/or ANK repeats region (amino acids 1838_2000), which are necessary for the transcriptional activity of NOTCH family proteins, as well as internal deletions that remove EGF repeats (7_10 and 21_22), have been shown in vitro to negatively affect ligand binding and reduce NOTCH3 transcriptional activity and are predicted to be inactivating (Kopan and Ilagan, 2009; 19379690, Deregowski et al., 2006; 16869730, Be\u00e0 et al., 2013; 24145436, McDaniell et al., 2006; 16773578, Lin et al., 2010; 20068176). NOTCH3 mutation was observed in <1% of clear cell carcinoma, 2.0% (3/148) of kidney chromophobe carcinoma, and 2.6% of renal papillary carcinoma samples analyzed in COSMIC (Jan 2023)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). In 1 study of 473 samples of renal cell carcinoma, NOTCH3 overexpression was observed in 51.5% of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) samples (Bhagat et al., 2017; 27909050). The frequency of NOTCH3 rearrangements in kidney cancer has not been evaluated (cBioPortal, COSMIC, Jan 2023)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of NOTCH3 alterations in kidney carcinoma are limited (PubMed, Jan 2023), although overexpression of NOTCH signaling pathway members in clear cell renal carcinoma has been correlated with better overall survival for patients in 1 study (Bhagat et al., 2017; 27909050). Several approaches for inhibiting NOTCH3 signaling are being developed, including neutralizing NOTCH antibodies such as tarextumab (OMP_59R5) (Yen et al., 2015; 25934888), which targets NOTCH2 and NOTCH3, and pan_NOTCH inhibitors, such as gamma_secretase inhibitors (GSI) (Hu et al., 2014; 24743243, Konishi et al., 2007; 17804716, Xiao et al., 2011; 20838375). In a Phase 2 study, the GSI AL101 (BMS_906024) elicited PR in 15% (6/39) and SD in 54% (21/39) of patients with metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma harboring NOTCH activating alterations (Ferrarotto et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 919MO). Phase 2 studies have evaluated the efficacy of tarextumab in combination with chemotherapy in metastatic pancreatic cancer or extensive_stage small cell lung cancer, though NOTCH3 expression was not found to be a predictor of OS or PFS in either study (Hu et al., 2019; 31347292; O\u2019Reilly et al., 2015; Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium Abstract 278, Daniel et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 1530PD).

Activation of TERT is a hallmark of cancer, being detected in up to 80_90% of malignancies and absent in quiescent cells (Shay et al., 1997; 9282118, Kim et al., 1994; 7605428, Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000; 10647931). Mutations within the promoter region of TERT that confer enhanced TERT promoter activity have been reported in two hotspots, located at _124 bp and _146 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (also termed C228T and C250T, respectively)(Horn et al., 2013; 23348503, Huang et al., 2014; 23348506, Vinagre et al., 2013; 23887589), as well as tandem mutations at positions \u2013124/\u2013125 bp and \u2013138/\u2013139 bp (Horn et al., 2013; 23348503). TERT mutations have been reported in <3% of papillary renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), clear cell RCCs and chromophobe RCCs (Tate et al., 2019; 30371878, cBio_Sanchez_Vega et al., 2018; 29625050, cBio_Sato et al., 2013; 23797736). In one study, TERT promoter mutations were detected in 9% (9/96) of clear cell RCC tumors and in 13% (1/8) of chromophobe RCC tumors (Wang et al., 2014; 24742867). TERT promoter mutations in RCC have been significantly associated with poor prognosis in survival in a retrospective study (Casuscelli et al., 2019; 28951115), and one study reported TERT promoter mutations correlating with advanced grade, metastasis, and higher TERT expression (Wang et al., 2014; 24742867). Therapeutic options for targeting tumors with TERT mutations are limited, although a variety of approaches have been investigated, including immunotherapies using TERT as a tumor_associated antigen and antisense oligonucleotide_ or peptide_based therapies. TERT peptide vaccines showed limited anticancer efficacy in clinical trials (Zanetti et al., 2017; 27245281); however, in one preclinical study, the combination of a TERT peptide vaccine and anti_CTLA_4 therapy suppressed tumor growth (Duperret at al., 2018; 29249395).
