Alterations such as seen here may disrupt BRCA1 function or expression (Nelson et al., 2010; 20681793, Silver and Livingston, 2012; 22843421, Ludwig et al., 2001; 11358863). BRCA1 mutation has been reported in <1% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases analyzed (cBio_Ahn et al., 2014; 24798001). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of BRCA1 has been detected at very low levels in an early study of hepatocellular carcinomas (n=29) (Piao et al., 1997; 9307185). One study has shown that high mRNA expression of BRCA1 is associated with worse overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) in patients with HCC (Mei et al., 2020, 32876480); another study associated high levels of cytoplasmic BRCA1 with favorable OS (Wang et al., 2018; 29126833). Alterations that inactivate BRCA1 or BRCA2 may confer sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Kaufman et al., 2015; 25366685, Mateo et al., 2015; 26510020, Tutt et al., 2010; 20609467, Robson et al., 2017; 28578601, Mirza et al., 2016; 27717299, Sandhu et al., 2013; 23810788, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594, Drew et al., 2016; 27002934, Pujade_Lauraine et al., 2017; 28754483, Ledermann et al., 2016; 27617661, Fong et al., 2009; 19553641, Audeh et al., 2010; 20609468, Fong et al., 2010; 20406929, Gelmon et al., 2011; 21862407, Kaye et al., 2012; 22203755, Domchek et al., 2016; 26723501, Moore et al., 2018; 30345884, Golan et al., 2019; 31157963) or ATR inhibitors (Yap et al., 2020; 32988960, Thomas et al., 2018; 29252124, O Carrigan et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2504, Yap et al., 2016; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract 1LBA, Saito et al., 2018; 31299005). Clinical responses to PARP inhibitors have been reported for patients with either germline or somatic BRCA1/2 mutations (Mateo et al., 2015; 26510020, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594, Ledermann et al., 2016; 27617661, Moore et al., 2018; 30345884, Golan et al., 2019; 31157963) and for patients with platinum_resistant or _refractory disease (Fong et al., 2010; 20406929, Kaufman et al., 2015; 25366685, Sandhu et al., 2013; 23810788, Domchek et al., 2016; 26723501). In a Phase 1 trial of monotherapy treatment with the ATR inhibitor BAY1895344, 2 patients with deleterious BRCA1 alterations and platinum_refractory ovarian carcinoma experienced a PR or prolonged SD (Yap et al., 2020; 32988960). In other Phase 1 trials of combination approaches, a patient with BRCA1_mutated ovarian carcinoma experienced prolonged SD from the ATR inhibitor berzosertib combined with topotecan (Thomas et al., 2018; 29252124); another patient with platinum_ and PARP_inhibitory refractory ovarian cancer and an inactivating germline BRCA1 mutation experienced a PR from berzosertib plus carboplatin (O Carrigan et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2504); and a third patient with BRCA1_mutated triple_negative breast cancer (TNBC) experienced a PR to the ATR inhibitor ceralasertib combined with olaparib (Yap et al., 2016; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract 1LBA). Preclinical studies of BRCA1/2 inactivation in T_cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T_ALL) (Pouliot et al., 2019; 31721781), ovarian carcinoma (Kim et al., 2017; 27993965), and TNBC (Jin et al., 2018; 29605721) showing reduced cell viability and increased DNA damage during ATR treatment further support the sensitivity of BRCA1_deficient cells to ATR inhibitors. The WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib has been evaluated as a monotherapy and in combination with PARP_inhibitor, olaparib. In a Phase 2 study for patients with PARP_resistant ovarian cancer, the combination of olaparib and adavosertib elicited improved clinical benefit (ORR: 29%; DCR: 89%) compared to adavosertib alone (ORR: 23%; DCR: 63%); however, in the BRCA_mutated cohort, no significant difference in clinical benefit was observed between the combination (ORR: 19%) and monotherapy (ORR: 20%) treatments (Westin et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 5505). In a Phase 1 monotherapy trial of adavosertib that included 9 patients with BRCA1/2_mutated solid tumors, 2 patients with BRCA1_mutated cancers (1 with ovarian serous carcinoma and 1 with oral squamous cell carcinoma) achieved PRs, and a third patient with ovarian serous carcinoma harboring mutations in BRCA1 and TP53 experienced 14% tumor shrinkage prior to disease progression (Do et al., 2015; 25964244). Inactivation of BRCA1 may also predict sensitivity to the DNA_damaging agents trabectedin and lurbinectedin (Cruz et al., 2018; 30240327, Awada et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 1072, Poveda et al., 2017; 28368437, Garcia et al., 2013; 23364677, Sch\u00f6ffski et al., 2011; 21376569, Aracil et al., 2014; Abstract 35, Italiano et al., 2011; 21287534, Laroche_Clary et al., 2015; 25602962, Ghouadni et al., 2017; 28467918, Tedesco et al., 2011; ASCO Abstract 1125, Monk et al., 2015; 25722380, Monk et al., 2020; 31924332, Yasui et al., 2016; 27077926). Inactivating germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 are associated with autosomal dominant hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (Miki et al., 1994; 7545954, Wooster et al., 1995; 8524414), and the lifetime risk of breast and ovarian cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers has been estimated to be as high as 87% and 44%, respectively (Ford et al., 1994; 7907678). Elevated risk for other cancer types, including gastric, pancreatic, prostate, and colorectal, has also been identified, with an increase in risk ranging from 20 to 60% (Friedenson, 2005; 16369438). The estimated prevalence of deleterious germline BRCA1/2 mutations in the general population is between 1:400 and 1:800, with an approximately 10_fold higher prevalence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (Ford et al., 1994; 7907678, Whittemore et al., 1997; 9042908, Claus et al., 1996; 8635102, Struewing et al., 1997; 9145676, Oddoux et al., 1996; 8841192, King et al., 2003; 14576434, Hall et al., 2009; 19241424).

Objective responses were observed for 80% (32/40) of patients with BRCA1/2 mutations, for 29% (24/82) with high LOH, and for 10% (7/10) with low LOH (Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). In heavily pretreated patients with a germline BRCA1/2 mutation who had received 2_4 prior chemotherapy treatments and had a progression free interval of greater than 6 months, 65% (17/26) of patients achieved an objective response with rucaparib treatment (Shapira_Frommer et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5513). In a Phase 2 study evaluating rucaparib for patients with advanced breast or ovarian cancer and germline BRCA1/2 mutations, disease control was observed in 92% (12/13) of patients with ovarian cancer treated with oral rucaparib dosed continuously, but no objective responses were reported in breast cancer patients (n=23). However, 39% (9/23) of evaluable patients with breast cancer achieved SD lasting 12 weeks or more (Drew et al., 2016; 27002934). In a Phase 1 study of rucaparib treatment in patients with solid tumors, 3/4 patients with ovarian cancer and 1/1 patient with breast cancer given the recommended Phase 2 dose reported objective responses; all responders harbored BRCA1/2 mutations (Kristeleit et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 2573).

In breast cancer, certain CHEK2 mutations are associated with higher grade and larger tumors as well as bilateral disease (Kilpivaara et al., 2005; 15472904). A study reported that a polymorphism in CHEK2 was associated with worse survival of patients with GBM, but this association lost significance after adjusting for other prognostic factors (Simon et al., 2006; 17016233, Dong et al., 2014; 24532427). Another study in prostate cancer reported that CHEK2 expression is decreased in higher grade tumors and that CHEK2 is a tumor suppressor that decreases the growth of prostate cancer cells and regulates androgen receptor signaling (Ta et al., 2015; 26573794). Limited clinical data indicate that CHEK2 inactivation may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. Patients with CHEK2_altered prostate cancer have experienced clinical responses to PARP inhibitors (Abida et al., 2020; 32086346, Mateo et al., 2020; 31806540, Mateo et al., 2015; 26510020). Clinical benefit has been observed for patients with ovarian (Swisher et al., 2017; 27908594, O Malley et al., 2017; AACR Abstract LB_A12) and testicular (Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006) cancers treated with PARP inhibitors. In a study of patients with metastatic breast cancer, 8 patients with CHEK2 mutation did not respond to olaparib treatment (Tung et al., 2020; 33119476). One study of patients with breast cancer reported that carriers of the CHEK2 H371Y mutation have a higher likelihood of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Liu et al., 2015; 25884806), whereas another study found that those who carry CHEK2 mutations have a lower frequency of objective clinical responses to neoadjuvant therapy (Pfeifer et al., 2014; 25414026). A third study reported that the CHEK2 1100delC mutation is not associated with differential efficacy of chemotherapy and endocrine therapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer (Kriege et al., 2015; 25958056). It is not known whether these therapeutic approaches would be relevant in the context of alterations that have not been fully characterized, as seen here. One or more of the CHEK2 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with familial breast cancer (ClinVar, Mar 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline CHEK2 mutation has been associated with cancer susceptibility of low to moderate penetrance, especially in hereditary breast cancer (Mahdavi et al., 2019; 30552672). CHEK2 germline mutation has been identified in approximately 2.5% of familial or high_risk breast cancer cases (Kleiblov\u00e1 et al., 2019; 31409080, Hauke et al., 2018; 29522266). Although heterozygous germline CHEK2 mutation increases breast cancer risk two_ to three_fold, it is not associated with younger age at diagnosis (Hauke et al., 2018; 29522266, Lu et al., 2019; 30128536). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of CHEK2 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors may detect nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

High bTMB levels were not detected in this sample. It is unclear whether the bTMB levels in this sample would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Depending on the clinical context, TMB testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. Average bTMB levels in solid tumors other than NSCLC have not been evaluated (cBioPortal, COSMIC, PubMed, Mar 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of bTMB levels in HCC are limited (PubMed, Jul 2022). In an analysis of the TCGA Liver HCC dataset, high TMB was associated with reduced PFS and OS (Shrestha et al., 2018; 30057891). A retrospective study of 128 patients with HCC who underwent curative resection reported decreased recurrence_free survival for patients with high TMB (>4.8 Muts/Mb) compared to those with low TMB (\u22644.8 Muts/Mb) measured in tissue samples (Cai et al., 2020; 31995247). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB) may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716), anti_PD_1 (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716), and anti_PD_1/CTLA4 therapies (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P). A Phase 2 multi_solid_tumor trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022). In non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single_agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 Muts/Mb_16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "FH", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "V435M", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "V435M"}}, "Interpretation": "FH encodes fumarate hydratase, an enzymatic component of the Krebs cycle. FH has been identified as a possible hypoxia inducible factor activating gene (Morris et al., 2004; 15220362). Loss_of_function germline mutations in FH are associated with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC); tumors arising in FH mutation carriers often demonstrate FH biallelic inactivation (Schmidt et al., 2020; 31085323, Lehtonen et al., 2006; 16155190, Tomlinson et al., 2002; 11865300, Gardie et al., 2011; 21398687). FH mutations have been detected in several tumor types, with the highest incidences reported in tumors of the endometrium (2.6%), skin (2.3%), liver (1.7%), stomach (1.5%), and lung (1.4%)(COSMIC, Jan 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). FH_deficient renal cell carcinoma (RCC) arises in about 20% of families affected by hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) and is associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis (Schmidt et al., 2020; 31085323, Lau et al., 2020; 31524643, Gardie et al., 2011; 21398687). A preclinical study showed that FH_deficient renal cancer cells are dependent on ABL1 activity and sensitive to the multikinase inhibitor vandetanib; treatment with vandetanib inhibited the growth and tumorigenicity of these cells in vitro and in vivo (Sourbier et al., 2014; 25490448). Tumors with FH loss or inactivation may therefore be sensitive to vandetanib, which is approved to treat medullary thyroid cancer and is in clinical trials in solid tumors. A Phase 2 trial of bevacizumab and erlotinib reported overall response rate in 60% (12/20) of patients with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer, and 29% (6/21) of patients with sporadic papillary renal cell carcinoma (Srinivasan et al., 2014; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). FH germline inactivating alterations are associated with FH tumor predisposition syndrome, also known as hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC), an autosomal_dominant syndrome characterized by cutaneous leiomyomata, uterine fibroids, and aggressive renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (Tomlinson et al., 2002; 11865300). Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma have also been described at lower frequency (Castro_Vega et al., 2014; 24334767, Muller et al., 2017; 28300276). Whereas cutaneous leiomyomata appear at a mean age of 30 years, increasing in size and number with age, the age at diagnosis of uterine fibroids ranges from 18 to 53 years (Muller et al., 2017; 28300276, Lehtonen, et al., 2011; 21404119).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI_H was not detected in a study of 122 hepatocellular (HCC) samples (Goumard et al., 2017; 28871000), although smaller studies have reported MSI in 0_18% of tumors (Gross_Goupil et al., 2003; 12640682, Zhang et al., 2005; 15918185, Chiappini et al., 2004; 14656944, Salvucci et al., 1999; 9926933, Wang et al., 2001; 11494037), and MSI at some level has been detected in a subset of HCC tumors (Goumard et al., 2017; 28871000).

SGK1 mutation has been observed in 6_16% of diffuse large B_cell lymphomas (cBio_Lohr et al., 2012; 22343534), 5/7 cases of variant nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL), and 1/6 cases of typical NLPHL (Hartmann et al., 2016; 26658840). SGK1 amplification and mutation have rarely been observed in other tumor types (cBioPortal, COSMIC, Jan 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Increased SGK1 expression has been reported in lung squamous cell carcinoma (Abbruzzese et al., 2012; 22240294), endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (Conza et al., 2017; 28177128), glioblastoma (Talarico et al., 2016; 26908461), and breast cancer (Sahoo et al., 2005; 16246546). The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 has been reported to block SGK1 activity in a preclinical study (Park et al., 1999; 10357815).

Additionally, preclinical studies have reported that SGK1 expression confers resistance to BYL719 in breast cancer cells harboring PIK3CA activating mutations (Castel et al., 2016; 27451907) and to the AKT inhibitors AZD5363 and MK2206 in breast cancer cells (Sommer et al., 2013; 23581296).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Fraction", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction Not Detected", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction Not Detected"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor fraction provides an estimate of the percentage of ctDNA present in a cell_free DNA (cfDNA) sample.

The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with elevated tumor fraction values have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus high sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations.
