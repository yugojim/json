AKT activation promotes cell survival via inhibition of apoptosis and also contributes to cell proliferation through several interactions with the cell cycle machinery; inappropriate activation of AKT can therefore lead to tumor formation (Vivanco and Sawyers, 2002; 12094235). Missense mutations and in_frame duplications that occur in the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of AKT1, as seen here, have been shown to transform cells and activate AKT signaling and are therefore considered to be oncogenic (Bessiere et al., 2015; 26137586, Auguste et al., 2015; 26362254, Chang et al., 2017; 29247016, Yeh et al., 2019; 31527710, Parikh et al., 2012; 23134728, Calleja et al., 2009; 19166270, Askham et al., 2010; 19802009). In the scientific literature, AKT1 mutation has been identified in 2_4% of endometrial carcinoma cases, with studies predominately reporting on the incidence of the most common AKT1 mutation in this disease, E17K (Cohen et al., 2010; 19853286, Shoji et al., 2009; 19491896, Tr\u00e9dan et al., 2013; 23238879, Dutt et al., 2009; 19738612). Elevated AKT1 activity has been reported in endometrial cancer tissues, with one study citing AKT1 activation in 53% (19/35) cases (Wahl et al., 2010; 19878980, Bland et al., 2009; 19396006, Tr\u00e9dan et al., 2013; 23238879). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of AKT1 alterations in endometrial cancer are limited (PubMed, Dec 2020). Mutations that activate AKT1 may predict activity of AKT1 inhibitors in various tumor types. Phase 3 trials of AKT inhibitor combination treatments for patients with advanced breast cancer (capivasertib) and prostate cancer (ipatasertib) are furthest in development (Smyth et al., 2020; 32312891, Schmid et al., 2020; SABCS Abstract PD1_11, De Bono et al., 2021; ASCO GU Abstract 13), and basket trials have also shown responses in a variety of other solid tumors (Hyman et al., 2017; 28489509, Kalinsky et al., 2020; 33377972). An NCI_MATCH subprotocol of capivasertib for patients with breast cancer (18 patients) and other tumor types (17 patients) reported an ORR of 29% (10/35) with 1 CR experienced by a patient with endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma and PRs experienced by 7 patients with breast cancer, 1 patient with uterine leiomyosarcoma, and 1 patient with oncocytic carcinoma of the parotid gland (Kalinsky et al., 2020; 33377972). On the basis of clinical data in endometrial cancers, AKT1 may predict activity to AKT1 inhibitors such as capivasertib. One patient with endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma experienced a CR in a basket trial of capivasertib (Kalinsky et al., 2020; 33377972), and another basket trial of capivasertib for heavily pre_treated patients included 2 PRs in 8 AKT1_mutated endometrial carcinomas (25%) (Hyman et al., 2017; 28489509). A Phase 1 study combining the mTORC1/2 inhibitor sapanisertib with metformin reported 1 PR in a patient with endometrial cancer harboring concurrent AKT and mTOR alterations (Coleman et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3017). On the basis of clinical data in solid tumors, AKT1 activating mutations may be sensitive to mTOR inhibitors such as everolimus and temsirolimus (Tredan et al., 2013; 23238879, Aghajanian et al., 2018; 29804638, Schneider et al., 2017; 27870581, Bryce et al., 2017; 28423702, Wheler et al., 2013; 23765114). In an exploratory analysis, a study for patients with AKT1_mutated hormone_receptor_positive (HR+), HER2_negative breast cancer treated with the investigational ATP_competitive MTOR_inhibitor sapanisertib and exemestane or fulvestrant reported a positive association between best overall response (CR+PR) and AKT1_mutated status (n=11) compared with patients with AKT1_wildtype status (n=42) (p<0.03) (Lim et al., 2021; 33820779). In a retrospective analysis of clinical outcomes for patients with HR+ breast cancer, AKT1 E17K was associated with significantly increased median duration of treatment with everolimus_containing regimens (Smyth et al., 2020; 31924700).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "AKT1 amplification or mutation may lead to activation of AKT signaling and therefore may result in sensitivity to AKT pathway inhibitors.

Individual patients with AKT1_mutated endometrial cancer (Tredan et al., 2013; 23238879, Aghajanian et al., 2018; 29804638), papillary thyroid cancer (Schneider et al., 2017; 27870581), ovarian cancer (Bryce et al., 2017; 28423702), or thymoma (Wheler et al., 2013; 23765114) have achieved objective response or disease control with mTOR inhibitor treatment.

Studies have reported modest activity of these therapies as single agents (ORRs of 0_4%), but improved activity has been observed when they are combined with other agents such as bevacizumab and doxorubicin (ORRs of 25_44%), for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors (Janku et al., 2014; 24440717, Janku et al., 2013; 23066039, Janku et al., 2012; 22271473, Janku et al., 2011; 21216929, Moroney et al., 2012; 22927482, Moroney et al., 2011; 21890452, Basho et al., 2017; 27893038, Moulder et al., 2015; 25878190, Byeon et al., 2020; doi: 10.21037/tcr.2020.04.07). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> Clinical benefit has been reported for several patients with PIK3CA_mutated endometrial cancer treated with everolimus as a single agent (Varnier et al., 2019; 31351267, Tredan et al., 2012; 23238879, Myers et al., 2016; 27016228) or combined with hormone therapy (Myers et al., 2016; 27016228, Slomovitz et al., 2015; 25624430). In a Phase 2 clinical trial of recurrent endometrial cancer, 43% (12/28) of patients reported SD at 8 weeks and 21% (6/28) of patients achieved clinical benefit at 20 weeks upon administration of everolimus monotherapy (Slomovitz et al., 2010; 20681032). Combination with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole for the same disease population achieved an ORR of 31% (11/35), with 9 CRs (Slomovitz et al., 2015; 25624430). Further addition of metformin to this regimen led to a clinical benefit rate (CR+PR+SD) of 67% (32/48), including PR in 29% (14/48) of cases; no significant difference was observed between cases with and without KRAS mutation (Soliman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5506). Everolimus achieved PR or SD in 35% of patients with recurrent endometrial carcinoma; KRAS mutation was associated with reduced median PFS (3.1 vs. 1.0 months) and median OS (9.3 vs. 2.3 months) (Tredan et al., 2012; 23238879). Another study investigating estrogen and/or progesterone receptor_positive gynecologic or breast malignancies featuring mutation or loss of genes in the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway, including PIK3CA, AKT1, or PTEN, observed SD in 17% (1/6) of patients with endometrial cancer following combined treatment with everolimus and anastrozole (Wheler et al., 2014; 24912489). No response was seen in a patient with endometrial stromal sarcoma and Peutz_Jeghers Syndrome associated with a germline STK11 mutation treated with a combination of everolimus and anastrozole (Noriega_Iriondo et al., 2015; 25649062). Whereas frequent adverse events precluded a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for the combination of trametinib and everolimus in a Phase 1b trial for solid tumors (Tolcher et al., 2014; 25344362), a retrospective study for heavily pretreated patients with solid tumors reported tolerable regimens of the combination for 23/31 patients, with 16 patients treated >3 months and evaluable patients achieving a median PFS of 6.5 months (Patterson et al., 2018; AACR Abstract 3891). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Temsirolimus", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Temsirolimus is an intravenous mTOR inhibitor that is FDA approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma.

A case report described a patient with heavily pretreated PIK3CA_mutated endometrial cancer who had SD for 17 months with temsirolimus alone followed by combination with letrozole (Dhami et al., 2018; 29588307). A Phase 2 clinical trial of temsirolimus in recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer reported PR in 4/29 (14%) chemotherapy_na\u00efve patients and 4% (1/25) of chemotherapy_treated patients, with SD reported in 69% (20/29) of chemotherapy_na\u00efve patients and 48% (12/25) of chemotherapy_treated patients; however, response in this study was found to be independent of molecular markers of PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway activation (Oza et al., 2011; 21788564). Another Phase 2 study of temsirolimus in patients with endometrial cancer reported PFS of >15 months in 6 patients and associated clinical benefit and longer PFS with mutation of AKT1 or CTNNB1, respectively (Myers et al., 2015; ASCO Annual Meeting Abstract 5592). Temsirolimus combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel achieved objective partial responses in 82% (9/11) of patients with endometrial cancer (Kollmannsberger et al., 2012; 21447615).

Mutation, loss, or inactivation of ARID1A has been reported in many cancers, and the gene is considered a tumor suppressor (Guan et al., 2011; 21900401, Jones et al., 2012; 22009941, Wiegand et al., 2010; 20942669, Jones et al., 2010; 20826764, Yan et al., 2014; 24293408, Wang et al., 2012; 22808142, Huang et al., 2012; 22922871, Chan_On et al., 2013; 24185513, Mamo et al., 2012; 21892209). ARID1A mutations, which are mostly truncating, have been identified along the entire gene and often correlate with ARID1A protein loss (Jones et al., 2012; 22009941, Wiegand et al., 2010; 20942669, Jones et al., 2010; 20826764, Zang et al., 2012; 22484628, Wang et al., 2011; 22037554), whereas ARID1A missense mutations are mostly uncharacterized. ARID1A alterations are particularly prevalent in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (46_50%), ovarian and uterine endometrioid carcinomas (24_44%), and cholangiocarcinoma (27%); they are also reported in up to 27% of gastric carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, pediatric Burkitt lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, and urothelial carcinoma samples analyzed (COSMIC, cBioPortal, 2021) (Tate et al., 2019; 30371878, Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Wu et al., 2014; 24618703, Jones et al., 2012; 22009941, Dulak et al., 2013; 23525077, Streppel et al., 2013; 23318448, Jiao et al., 2014; 24293293, Ross et al., 2014; 24563076). ARID1A loss is associated with microsatellite instability in ovarian and endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinomas (Huang et al., 2014; 25195947, Hussein et al., 2014; 25394778, Bosse et al., 2013; 23702729, Allo et al., 2014; 23887303, Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729), CRC (Chou et al., 2014; 24925223, Ye et al., 2014; 25311944, Wei et al., 2014; 25561809, Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729), and gastric cancer (Chen et al., 2015; 25583476, Wang et al., 2011; 22037554, Abe et al., 2012; 22915242, Wang et al., 2012; 22808142, Wiegand et al., 2014; 24767857, Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729). Several studies have reported no correlation between ARID1A loss and clinicopathological parameters in ovarian clear cell or endometrioid carcinomas or other endometrial cancers (Rahman et al., 2013; 22939958, Maeda et al., 2010; 21614196, Lowery et al., 2012; 22193641, Fadare et al., 2013; 23524907), whereas others suggest that ARID1A loss is a negative prognostic factor (Mao et al., 2013; 24076775, Katagiri et al., 2012; 22101352). There are no therapies approved to address the mutation or loss of ARID1A in cancer. However, on the basis of limited clinical and preclinical evidence, ARID1A inactivating mutations may lead to sensitivity to ATR inhibitors such as M6620; 1 patient with small cell lung cancer harboring an ARID1A mutation experienced a PR when treated with M6620 combined with topotecan (Thomas et al., 2018; 29252124, Williamson et al., 2016; 27958275). On the basis of limited preclinical evidence from studies in ovarian cancer, ARID1A inactivation may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of EZH2 (Bitler et al., 2015; 25686104, Kim et al., 2015; 26552009), which are under investigation in clinical trials. Other studies have reported that loss of ARID1A may activate the PI3K_AKT pathway and be linked with sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway (Wiegand et al., 2014; 24559118, Huang et al., 2014; 24336158, Samartzis et al., 2014; 24979463). Loss of ARID1A expression has been associated with chemoresistance to platinum_based therapy in patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma (Yokoyama et al., 2014; 24459582, Katagiri et al., 2012; 22101352) and to 5_fluorouracil (5_FU) in CRC cell lines (Xie et al., 2014; 24833095).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "ARID1A loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to ATR inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT02264678", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02630199", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02595931", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03641547", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03669601", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "CTNNB1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "S33Y", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "S33Y"}}, "Interpretation": "CTNNB1 encodes beta_catenin, a key downstream component of the WNT signaling pathway.

CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations, such as observed here, lead to increased beta_catenin protein stability and activation of the WNT pathway, and are considered to be activating (Anastas and Moon, 2013; 23258168, Fukuchi et al., 1998; 9721853, Kikuchi et al., 2003; 12824913, Takahashi et al., 2006; 16523258, Tanaka et al., 2001; 11731417, Abraham et al., 2002; 11943721, Austinat et al., 2008; 18282277, Wu et al., 2003; 12820959, Provost et al., 2005; 15829978, Polakis, 1999; 10072352, Segditsas and Tomlinson, 2006; 17143297, Barth et al., 1997; 9024698, Harada et al., 1999; 10545105, Hsu et al., 1998; 9671490, Breuhahn et al., 2008; 18491352, Soon et al., 2008; 18515740, Tacon et al., 2011; 21212436, Simon and Hammer, 2012; 22266195, Hirotsu et al., 2016; 26850916). CTNNB1 mutations have been reported in 7_45% of endometrial carcinomas (ECs) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2013; 23636398, Dellinger et al., 2012; 22149432, Saegusa et al., 2001; 11161379, McConechy et al., 2014; 23765252, Huang et al., 2013; 23760948). CTNNB1 mutations are more common in Type 1 EC than Type 2 (Yeramian et al., 2012; 22430211, Machin et al., 2002; 11957146). In addition, one study found that CTNNB1 mutations were identified more frequently in sporadic ECs (31%, 18/58), than in Lynch syndrome (LS)_associated ECs (6.9%, 2/29) (Huang et al., 2013; 23760948). Nuclear beta_catenin protein expression has been observed in 14.7_27.6% (33/224_55/199) of ECs, with a significantly higher incidence in Type 1 tumors (Peir\u00f3 et al., 2013; 22955108, Saegusa et al., 2001; 11161379). Multiple studies have reported that CTNNB1 mutation characterizes an aggressive subset of EC (Kurnit et al., 2017; 28281553, Stelloo et al., 2016; 27006490, Liu et al., 2014; 25214561). One study found that that TP53 or CTNNB1 mutation was an independent marker of poor recurrence_free survival (HR=4.69) for patients with low grade, early stage EC (Kurnit et al., 2017; 28281553). Low membrane expression of beta_catenin has been linked with poor prognosis in EC and ovarian endometrioid carcinomas (Rosen et al., 2010; 19820688, Athanassiadou et al., 2007; 17504383). Solid tumors with WNT/beta_catenin pathway alterations, as seen here, were observed to have significantly less T_cell inflammation in one study (Luke et al., 2019; 30635339). Mutation or activation of CTNNB1 signaling has been shown to increase mTOR signaling, promote tumorigenesis, and respond to mTOR inhibition in preclinical studies (Tanwar et al., 2009; 19403928, Tanwar et al., 2011; 21695255, Fujishita et al., 2008; 18768809). Small studies have reported clinical benefit following treatment of everolimus combined with other targeted agents for patients with CTNNB1_mutated hepatocellular carcinoma (Bhoori et al., 2010; 20347502, Janku et al., 2014; 24931142) or endometrial carcinoma (Slomovitz et al., 2015; 25624430). In preclinical studies, CTNNB1 activating mutations have been shown to increase expression of WNT pathway member DKK1, which may promote tumor cell proliferation and immune evasion (Niida et al., 2004; 15378020, Chamorro et al., 2005; 15592430, Kagey and He, 2017; 28574171). A Phase 1 trial of DKK1_targeting antibody DKN_01 in combination with paclitaxel in esophageal cancer reported a PR rate in 2 out of 4 patients and SD rate of in 1 out of 4 patients with CTNNB1 activating mutations, compared with 24% (10/41) PR and 37% (15/41) SD in unselected patients (Kagey et al., 2017; AACR Abstract 369). Multiple preclinical studies in cancer models harboring CTNNB1 mutation or beta_catenin pathway activation have reported activation of the NOTCH pathway and sensitivity to pharmacologic inhibition of NOTCH signaling by gamma_secretase inhibitors (Kwon et al., 2011; 21841793, Arcaroli et al., 2013; 23868008, Shang et al., 2015; 26349011, Kode et al., 2014; 24429522). Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of gamma_secretase inhibitor PF_03084014 have shown high response rates in patients with desmoid tumors, which are driven by activating CTNNB1 mutations in the majority of cases (Kummar et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 10563)(Messersmith et al., 2015; 25231399), suggesting CTNNB1_mutated tumors may be sensitive to gamma_secretase inhibitors. Although WNT pathway inhibitors have been explored preclinically in CTNNB1_mutated cells, clinical data supporting this therapeutic approach are lacking (Zhu et al., 2012; 22964660, Tanwar et al., 2011; 21695255, Kogan et al., 2012; 22356261, Lachenmayer et al., 2012; 22811581).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Based on clinical and preclinical evidence, tumors with activating CTNNB1 alterations may be sensitive to mTOR inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04337463", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04803318", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03008408", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03065062", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT01582191", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02159989", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02321501", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03017833", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03430882", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "PIK3CA", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "H419_C420del", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "H419_C420del"}}, "Interpretation": "PIK3CA encodes p110_alpha, which is the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3_kinase (PI3K). The PI3K pathway is involved in cell signaling that regulates a number of critical cellular functions, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival (Samuels et al., 2005; 15950905, Engelman, 2009; 19629070). Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized, they have been associated with sensitivity to targeted therapies or have shown cancer association, which may indicate biological relevance (Tate et al., 2019; 30371878, Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2012; 22729224, Akgumus et al., 2017; 28502730, Slomovitz et al., 2015; 25624430, Al_Rohil et al., 2016; 26479420, Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). In the scientific literature, PIK3CA mutations have been reported in 16_54% of endometrial carcinomas (Garcia_Dios et al., 2013; 23219661, Rudd et al., 2011; 21266528, Kandoth et al., 2013; 23636398). In endometrial cancers, PIK3CA mutations often co_occur with other mutations that activate the PI3K_AKT_mTOR signaling axis, such as PTEN and KRAS alterations (Oda et al., 2005; 16322209, Oda et al., 2008; 18829572). Overexpression of p110_alpha has been reported in 72% of endometrial carcinomas (Akiyama_Abe et al., 2013; 23949151). One study reported PIK3CA exon 9 or 20 mutations in 20% (20/99) of high_grade endometrial carcinomas; these mutations were associated with shorter patient survival within Grade 3 endometrioid carcinoma, but not within endometrial serous carcinoma (McIntyre et al., 2013; 24262879). Clinical and preclinical data in various tumor types indicate that PIK3CA activating alterations may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting PI3K (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574, Juric et al., 2018; 29401002, Gallant et al., 2019; 30793038), AKT (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Smyth et al., 2021; 33863913), or mTOR (Park et al., 2016; 27105424, Lim et al., 2016; 26859683, Hou et al., 2014; 25426553, Varnier et al., 2019; 31351267, Janku et al., 2014; 24440717, Moroney et al., 2012; 22927482, Basho et al., 2017; 27893038, Moroney et al., 2011; 21890452). Results from the Phase 2 MATCH trial for patients with PIK3CA_altered solid tumors found that 27% (18/65) of patients experienced PFS lasting at least 6 months after treatment with taselisib; however, no ORs were observed in this study (Krop et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 101). In a Phase 1 trial of the dual PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitor apitolisib, 79% (11/14) of patients with PIK3CA_mutated advanced solid tumors experienced disease control (3 PRs, 8 SDs) (Dolly et al., 2016; 26787751). The PI3K inhibitor alpelisib demonstrated an ORR of 6.0% (8/134) and a DCR of 58% (78/134) in a study of PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors (Juric et al., 2018; 2941002). However, the PI3K inhibitor copanlisib exhibited limited efficacy in PIK3CA_altered tumors (Santin et al., 2020; 31934607, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108). It is not known whether these therapeutic approaches would be relevant in the context of alterations that have not been fully characterized, as seen here. Activating mutations in PIK3CA may confer resistance to HER2_targeted therapies; combined inhibition of HER2 and the PI3K pathway may be required in HER2_positive tumors with PIK3CA mutation (Esteva et al., 2010; 20813970, Baselga et al., 2014; 25332247, Chakrabarty et al., 2010; 20581867, Cizkova et al., 2010; San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium Abstract P2_09_30, Kataoka et al., 2010; 19633047, Wang et al., 2011; 21676217).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PIK3CA activating mutations may lead to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may therefore indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.

In a Phase 2 clinical trial of recurrent endometrial cancer, 43% (12/28) of patients reported SD at 8 weeks and 21% (6/28) of patients achieved clinical benefit at 20 weeks upon administration of everolimus monotherapy (Slomovitz et al., 2010; 20681032). Combination with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole for the same disease population achieved an ORR of 31% (11/35), with 9 CRs (Slomovitz et al., 2015; 25624430). Further addition of metformin to this regimen led to a clinical benefit rate (CR+PR+SD) of 67% (32/48), including PR in 29% (14/48) of cases; no significant difference was observed between cases with and without KRAS mutation (Soliman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5506). Everolimus achieved PR or SD in 35% of patients with recurrent endometrial carcinoma; KRAS mutation was associated with reduced median PFS (3.1 vs. 1.0 months) and median OS (9.3 vs. 2.3 months) (Tredan et al., 2012; 23238879). Another study investigating estrogen and/or progesterone receptor_positive gynecologic or breast malignancies featuring mutation or loss of genes in the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway, including PIK3CA, AKT1, or PTEN, observed SD in 17% (1/6) of patients with endometrial cancer following combined treatment with everolimus and anastrozole (Wheler et al., 2014; 24912489).

Alterations such as seen here may disrupt ASXL1 function or expression (Inoue et al., 2013; 24216483, Abdel_Wahab et al., 2012; 22897849, Katoh et al., 2013; 23736028). ASXL1 alterations occur infrequently across various solid tumor types (cBio_Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359) and are not known to act as drivers in any specific solid cancer type (Bailey et al., 2018; 29625053). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of ASXL1 alterations in solid tumors are limited (PubMed, May 2021). In the context of clonal hematopoiesis, ASXL1 mutations are significantly enriched in current or former smokers (Bolton et al., 2020; 33106634). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in ASXL1. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS has been reported in 73_89% of endometrial cancers (Cancer Genome Research Atlas., 2013; 23636398, Black et al., 2006; 16549821, Mackay et al., 2010; 20304627, Kanopiene et al., 2014; 25458958, Hampel et al., 2006; 16885385, Steinbakk et al., 2011; 21547578, Bilbao et al., 2010; 20005452, Church et al., 2013; 23528559). Data regarding the role of MSI status on prognosis and survival in endometrial cancer are conflicting, with most studies finding no relationship between MSI_H endometrial cancers and survival (Zighelboim et al., 2007; 17513808, Kanopiene et al., 2014; 25458958, Bilbao_Sieyro et al., 2014; 25026289, Mackay et al., 2010; 20304627, Steinbakk et al., 2011; 21547578, Arabi et al., 2009; 19275958), and one study predicting improved disease_free and disease_specific survival (Black et al., 2006; 16549821). However, these studies often evaluated endometrial cancers of all FIGO stages together. Studies specifically analyzing early stage endometrial cancer have reported a correlation between MSI_H and decreased survival (Stelloo et al., 2016; 27006490, Mackay et al., 2010; 20304627, Nout et al., 2012; 22609107, Bilbao et al., 2010; 20005452), thereby suggesting that MSI_H predicts for poor prognosis in this subset of endometrial tumors. On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "01", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "01"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB level associated with lower rates of clinical benefit from treatment with PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors compared with patients with tumors harboring higher TMB levels, based on several studies in multiple solid tumor types (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). A large_scale genomic analysis found that endometrial adenocarcinomas harbored a median TMB of 4.5 Muts/Mb, and 15% of cases had an elevated TMB of greater than 20 Muts/Mb (FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). Another study evaluating TMB in endometrial adenocarcinoma reported that 24% of tumors had a mutational burden of greater than 10.4 Muts/Mb (Santin et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5591). Increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) in endometrial carcinoma has been correlated with POLE mutation and advanced high_grade endometrioid subtypes (Mehnert et al., 2016; 27159395, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Hussein et al., 2015; 25394778, Church et al., 2013; 23528559). Ultramutated endometrial tumors (elevated TMB with POLE mutations) have also been associated with improved PFS (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398). The same study associated lower mutational burden, independent of PD_L1 status, in endometrial carcinomas with poorer prognosis (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398). For patients with advanced microsatellite_stable endometrial carcinoma not treated with immunotherapy, OS did not significantly differ between patients with TMB_high (\u226510 Muts/Mb) and TMB_low (11.4 vs. 13.5 months, adjusted HR=1.15) in 1 study (Shao et al., 2020; 33119110). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, higher TMB has been reported to be associated with increased ORR and OS from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). Higher TMB was found to be significantly associated with improved OS upon immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment for patients with 9 types of advanced tumors (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254). Analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy, compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386). However, the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors found significant improvement in ORR for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (based on this assay or others) compared to those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb, in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types; similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). Together, these studies suggest that patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb may derive clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1 inhibitors.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "AKT1", "Alteration": "L52R", "Title": "Tumor_Agnostic Precision Immuno_Oncology and Somatic Targeting Rational for You (TAPISTRY) Platform Study", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "ALK, ROS1, TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, RET, PD_L1, AKTs, ERBB2, MDM2, PI3K_alpha", "Locations": "Zhongzheng Dist.
