R132 is located within the active site of IDH1 and is a hotspot for mutations in cancer (Jin et al., 2011; 21326614, Gross et al., 2010; 20142433, Ward et al., 2010; 20171147, Leonardi et al., 2012; 22442146, Reitman and Yan, 2010; 20513808). Substitutions at IDH1 R132 alter the enzymatic activity of IDH1, resulting in the production of the oncometabolite, D_2_hydroxyglutarate (2_HG)(Dang et al., 2009; 19935646, Ward et al., 2012; 21996744, Ward et al., 2010; 20171147, Gross et al., 2010; 20142433, Leonardi et al., 2012; 22442146), which promotes tumorigenesis (Gross et al., 2010; 20142433, Figueroa et al., 2010; 21130701, Xu et al., 2011; 21251613, Turcan et al., 2012; 22343889, Duncan et al., 2012; 22899282). IDH1 mutation is characteristic of low_grade gliomas and secondary glioblastoma, and is relatively rare in primary glioblastoma (Chaumeil et al., 2013; 24019001, Hartmann et al., 2013; 23918605, Rossetto et al., 2011; 21885076, Shin et al., 2013; 24129546, Parsons et al., 2008; 18772396). In the TCGA datasets, IDH1 mutation has been found in 77% of lower grade glioma cases and in 5% of glioblastoma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751, cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). In the context of IDH_mutated gliomas, TERT mutations are associated with improved OS (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022)(Arita et al., 2020; 33228806). IDH1/2 mutations are a strong favorable prognostic marker for OS in Grade 2_3 glioma, particularly in combination with 1p/19q codeletion (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022). Several studies have found IDH1 mutations to be associated with improved prognosis and longer PFS and OS in patients with various types of glioma including anaplastic astrocytoma and GBM (Hartmann et al., 2010; 21088844, Sonoda et al., 2009; 19765000, Ahmadi et al., 2012; 22528790, Jiang et al., 2013; 23486687, Shibahara et al., 2012; 21971842, Parsons et al., 2008; 18772396, Juratli et al., 2012; 23015095, Weller et al., 2009; 19805672). IDH1 mutations that lead to production of 2_HG, most commonly R132 alterations, may predict sensitivity to IDH1_mutation_specific inhibitors such as ivosidenib (Abou_Alfa et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA10, Fan et al., 2019; 31028664, Mellinghoff et al., 2017; SNO Abstract ACTR_46, Tap et al., 2016; CTOS Abstract P1_138) and olutasidenib (De la Fuenta et al., 2022; 35639513, Jones et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2020.38.15_suppl.e16643). A Phase 1B/2 basket study of the IDH1 inhibitor olutasidenib reported a DCR of 48% (12/25, 2 PR) in patients with glioma; patients with other solid tumors including intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and chondrosarcoma achieved SD (De la Fuenta et al., 2022; 35639513, Jones et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2020.38.15_suppl.e16643). A Phase 1 study of the pan_IDH1/IDH2 inhibitor vorasidenib for patients with IDH1_ or IDH2_mutated glioma reported an ORR of 18% (4/22; RANO criteria) and median PFS of 31.4 months for non_enhancing cases and median PFS of 7.5 months for the overall glioma population (n=52) (Mellinghoff et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 2504). Preclinical studies suggested that IDH1 neomorphic mutations may also confer sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Philip et al., 2018; 29719265, Molenaar et al., 2018; 29339439, Lu et al., 2017; 28202508, Sulkowski et al., 2017; 28148839). In a Phase 1 trial of the PD_L1 inhibitor atezolizumab for patients with glioblastoma (GBM), 2/3 patients with IDH1_mutated tumors experienced clinical benefit (1 PR, 1 long_term SD, 1 short_term SD), whereas none of the 8 patients with IDH1_wildtype GBM experienced benefit (8/8 PD); significantly longer PFS and a trend toward longer OS were observed for patients with IDH1_mutated tumors compared with the patients with IDH1_wildtype tumors (Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642). A Phase 1 trial of the oral brain_penetrant mutated IDH1 selective inhibitor DS_1001 for patients with recurrent or progressive IDH1_mutated glioma reported 2 CRs and 4 PRs for 35 patients with enhancing tumors and 1 PR and 3 minor responses (MRs) for 12 patients with non_enhancing tumors (Natsume et al., 2022; 35722822). Preclinical data indicate that IDH1_mutated glioma may be sensitive to the glutaminase inhibitor telaglenastat in combination with radiotherapy (McBrayer et al., 2018; 30220459, Kizilbash et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract TPS2075). IDH1/2 mutations are associated with improved survival outcomes for patients with glioma treated with radiation or alkylating chemotherapy (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022). Addition of procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (PCV) to radiotherapy significantly improved OS for patients with IDH_mutated (9.4 vs. 5.7 years, HR=0.59) but not IDH_non_mutated (1.3 versus 1.8 years, HR=1.14) anaplastic oligodendroglioma/oligoastrocytoma (Cairncross et al., 2014; 24516018). As adjuvant therapy after radiation for patients with IDH1/2_mutated anaplastic astrocytoma, temozolomide (van den Bent et al., 2021; 34000245) or PCV (Esteyrie et al., 2021; 33524191) improved median PFS and median OS relative to radiotherapy or temozolomide alone, respectively. Co_occurring TERT mutation, IDH mutation, and 1p/19q co_deletion is indicative of oligodendroglioma (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022)(Weller et al., 2020; 33293629). IDH1/2 mutation is associated with Grade 2 and 3 astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, with the latter also harboring 1p19q deletion, and distinguishes secondary glioblastoma (GBM) from primary GBM (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "IDH1 mutations may predict sensitivity to IDH1 inhibitors.

Neurofibromin acts as a tumor suppressor by repressing RAS signaling (Morcos et al., 1996; 8628317). The consequences of alterations that may leave the GAP_related domain intact, such as seen here, are unclear; however, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. NF1 mutation has been observed in 5_6% of lower grade gliomas and 9_14% of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cases; homozygous deletion of NF1 was observed in 1% of lower grade gliomas and 2_3% of GBMs (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751, cBio_Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890). Among GBM subtypes, NF1 mutation and loss were reported most frequently in the mesenchymal subtype, 37% (14/28) and 38% (21/55) of cases, respectively (Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251). NF1 loss was significantly associated with decreased overall and disease_specific survival in patients with lower grade gliomas (II_III), but not in those with GBM (Vizcaino et al., 2015; 26190195).

On the basis of limited clinical data (Lim et al., 2016; 26859683 , Weiss et al., 2015; 25314964, Janku et al., 2014; 24931142) and preclinical data (Johannessen et al., 2008; 18164202, Johannessen et al., 2005; 15937108), loss or inactivation of NF1 may predict sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors, including everolimus and temsirolimus. A preclinical study suggests that combined mTOR and MEK inhibition is effective in a model of NF1_deficient malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) (Malone et al., 2014; 24913553). It is not known whether these therapeutic approaches would be relevant in the context of alterations that have not been fully characterized, as seen here. One or more of the NF1 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (ClinVar, Sep 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in NF1 cause the autosomal dominant disorder neurofibromatosis type 1, which is characterized in part by increased risk of developing various tumors, including sarcoma, glioma, breast carcinoma, and neuroendocrine and hematological neoplasms (Jett and Friedman, 2010; 20027112, Patil and Chamberlain, 2012; 22240541, Evans et al., 2012; 23036231). Estimates for the prevalence of the disorder in the general population range from 1:2,500 to 1:3,000 (Upadhyaya et al., 1995; 8544190, Williams et al., 2009; 19117870), and in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of NF1 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "On the basis of clinical evidence and strong preclinical evidence, NF1 inactivation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors.

A study of 5 patients with KIAA1549_BRAF_fusion_positive pilocytic astrocytoma reported 1 PR and 3 minor responses (Kondyli et al., 2018; 30097824) and, similarly, a patient with low_grade glioma harboring this fusion benefited from trametinib (Wagner et al., 2018; 29369501). A patient with pilocytic astrocytoma harboring an NFIA_RAF1 fusion who had progressed on multiple lines of prior treatment exhibited ongoing SD following treatment with trametinib (Yde et al., 2016; 27810072). Whereas frequent adverse events precluded a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for the combination of trametinib and everolimus in a Phase 1b trial for solid tumors (Tolcher et al., 2014; 25344362), a retrospective study for heavily pretreated patients with solid tumors reported tolerable regimens of the combination for 23/31 patients, with 16 patients treated >3 months and evaluable patients achieving a median PFS of 6.5 months (Patterson et al., 2018; AACR Abstract 3891). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Selumetinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Selumetinib is a MEK inhibitor that is FDA approved to treat pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)_associated plexiform neurofibromas (PNs).

PIK3CA alterations that have been characterized as activating, such as observed here, are predicted to be oncogenic (Kang et al., 2005; 15647370, Ikenoue et al., 2005; 15930273, Gymnopoulos et al., 2007; 17376864, Horn et al., 2008; 18317450, Rudd et al., 2011; 21266528, Hon et al., 2012; 22120714, Burke et al., 2012; 22949682, Wu et al., 2009; 19915146, Dbouk et al., 2010; 2103068, Dan et al., 2010; 20530683, Oda et al., 2008; 18829572, Zhao and Vogt, 2008; 18794883, Lui et al., 2013; 23619167, Ross et al., 2013; 22430209, Riviere et al., 2012; 22729224, Shibata et al., 2009; 19394761, Droguluk et al., 2015; 26627007, Croessmann et al., 2018; 29284706, Ng et al., 2018; 29533785, Spangle et al., 2020; 32929011, Chen et al., 2018; 29636477, Jin et al., 2021; 34779417). PIK3CA mutations have been reported in 9% of glioblastoma (GBM) samples analyzed in the TCGA dataset (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142), and other studies report the incidence of PIK3CA mutations in primary GBMs as 5_18% (Gallia et al., 2006; 17050665, Broderick et al., 2004; 15289301, El_Habr et al., 2010; 20569675). One study detected PIK3CA mutation in 16% (36/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). PIK3CA mutations have been reported in 5_23% of high_grade gliomas (including glioblastomas, anaplastic astrocytomas, and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas) (El_Habr et al., 2010; 20569675, Gallia et al., 2006; 17050665, Broderick et al., 2004; 15289301, Derakhshandeh_Peykar et al., 2011; 22026810, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890). While another study did not observe PIK3CA mutations in low_grade astrocytomas or in anaplastic astrocytomas, it did report high ERK and AKT activity (El_Habr et al., 2010; 20569675). One study found that PIK3CA mutation in glioblastoma (GBM) was associated with shorter median PFS in both a discovery cohort (6.9 vs. 12.4 months, HR=2.89, p=0.01) and in the TCGA cohort (6.1 vs. 9 months, p=0.008), but was not consistently associated with median OS (Tanaka et al., 2019; 31036078). In a study of IDH_wildtype GBM, patients with alterations in PI3K class I genes (PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PIK3CG, and PIK3R2) had significantly longer OS (20.0 months altered vs. 16.9 months wildtype, HR=0.62, p=0.002) and PFS (11.0 months altered vs. 7.4 months wildtype, p=0.0043); patients with PIK3CA alterations experienced an improved OS but this association was not highly significant (20.0 months altered vs. 18.1 months wildtype, p=0.0407)(Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Clinical and preclinical data in various tumor types indicate that PIK3CA activating alterations may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting PI3K (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574, Juric et al., 2018; 29401002, Gallant et al., 2019; 30793038, Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23, Delestre et al., 2021; 34613809, Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Santin et al., 2020; 31934607, Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871), AKT (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Smyth et al., 2021; 33863913), or mTOR (Varnier et al., 2019; 31351267, Basse et al., 2018; 32914004, Sultova et al., 2021; 33277683, Mackay et al., 2014; 24166148, Myers et al., 2016; 27016228, Dhami et al., 2018; 29588307, Harris et al., 2019; 30863722, Hanna et al., 2018; 29301825). The Phase 2 NCI_MATCH study of copanlisib for patients with refractory solid tumors harboring PIK3CA mutations with or without PTEN loss met its primary endpoint with an ORR of 16% (4/25 PRs); responses (PR or SD >6 months) were seen in patients with ameloblastoma, liposarcoma, and carcinomas of the endometrium, ovary, esophagus, lung, and prostate (Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871). However, the Phase 2 study of copanlisib for patients with endometrial carcinoma harboring PIK3CA hotspot mutations failed to report any objective responses (n=11)(Santin et al., 2020; 31934607). Two other studies of copanlisib for patients with genomically unselected tumors reported 1 CR and 2 PRs (1 unconfirmed) among 16 total patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors with or without PTEN alterations (Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108). In the Phase 2 MATCH trial for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors, 28% (18/65) of patients experienced PFS lasting at least 6 months after treatment with taselisib; however, no ORs were observed in this study (Krop et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 101). A separate Phase 1b study of taselisib in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors reported an ORR of 0% (n=12) and a DCR of 17% (2/12) (Pascual et al., 2021; 32958578). In a Phase 1 trial of the dual PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitor apitolisib, 79% (11/14) of patients with PIK3CA_mutated advanced solid tumors experienced disease control (3 PRs, 8 SDs) (Dolly et al., 2016; 26787751). The PI3K inhibitor alpelisib is approved as a single agent for the treatment of patients with PIK3CA_related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) (Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23), but has shown limited activity as monotherapy for PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors with a Phase 1a study reporting an ORR of 6.0% (8/134) and a DCR of 58% (78/134) (Juric et al., 2018; 29401002).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PIK3CA activating mutations may lead to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may therefore indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.

The variants N181S, V348L, P854Q, and T926M have demonstrated similar activity as wildtype ERBB4 in limited preclinical studies (Tvorogov et al., 2008; 19098003, Kurppa et al., 2016; 26050618). A single_nucleotide polymorphism in ERBB4 has been associated with increased risk of non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the Chinese Han population (Wang et al., 2021; 34106605). ERBB4 mutations have been identified in various solid tumors, including stomach (13%), salivary gland (11%, 2/18), esophageal (9%), lung (8_9%), endometrioid (6%), colorectal (5%), head and neck (5%), and gallbladder carcinomas (3.9%, 2/51), and melanoma (1.8%)(Prickett et al., 2009; 19718025, Kang et al., 2017; 27340278, Milewska et al., 2018; 29383036, Hu et al, 2021; 34620079, Li et al., 2014; 24997986, Dutton_Regester et al., 2012; 22383533). In hematological malignancies, ERBB4 mutations are rare, and have been reported at low frequency in diffuse large B_cell lymphoma (DLBCL)(2.2%_5.7%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)(0.6_1.1%), and multiple myeloma (0.5%)(cBio_Chapuy et al., 2018; 29713087, cBio_Lohr et al., 2012; 22343534, cBio_Morin et al., 2013; 23699601, cBio_Puente et al., 2015; 26200345, cBio_Quesada et al., 2011; 22158541, cBio_Landau et al., 2015; 26466571, cBio_Lohr et al., 2014; 24434212). ERBB4 amplification has been predominantly detected in gastric tumors (67%)(Shi et al., 2012; 22606006). ERBB4 fusions have been identified infrequently in solid tumors and peripheral T_cell lymphoma, although evidence for ERBB4 fusions as driver alterations is generally limited (Schubert et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3091, Guenzi et al., 2021; 33816604, Nakaoku et al., 2014; 24727320, Guo et al., 2016; 26949921, Boddicker et al., 2016; 27297792). Expression of N_terminally truncated oncogenic ERBB4 variants has been reported in ALK fusion_negative anaplastic large cell lymphomas (Scarfo et al., 2016; 26463425). ERBB4 mutation correlates with poorer survival for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC)(Williams et al., 2015; 25916654). Increased ERBB4 expression has been associated with worse clinical outcomes for patients with CRC (Baiocchi et al., 2009; 19390858, Ljuslinder et al., 2009; 19443355), bone sarcoma (Merimsky et al., 2003; 12883746), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)(Yu et al., 2018; 29729836), oral SCC (Silva et al., 2014; 24338375), metastatic Ewing sarcoma (Mendoza_Naranjo et al., 2013; 23681745), gastric cancer (Xu et al., 2018; 29620274), osteosarcoma (Huang et al., 2019; 31663373), or triple_negative breast cancer (Kim et al. 2016; 26907936). In contrast, high ERBB4 expression has been described as a positive prognostic factor in breast cancer (Witton et al., 2003; 12845624, Fuchs et al., 2006; 17201160, Wang et al., 2016; 27736797), ovarian cancer (Gilmour et al., 2001; 11280782), cervical carcinomas (Lee et al., 2005; 16157365), hormone_sensitive and castrate_resistant prostate cancer (Edwards et al., 2006; 16397033), and EGFR_negative intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (Yang et al., 2014; 24927194). The ERBB family kinase inhibitors afatinib and lapatinib, the EGFR inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib, and the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib have been shown to inhibit ERBB4 at clinically achievable concentrations (Solca et al., 2012; 22888144, Nam et al., 2011; 21306821, Davis et al., 2011; 22037378, Qiu et al., 2008; 18334220, Karaman et al., 2008; 18183025, Rauf et al., 2018; 29398709). However, whether these inhibitors would be clinically effective for patients with ERBB4 mutation is unclear. Retrospective analyses of the Phase 3 LUX_Lung 8 trial reported that patients with squamous non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring mutations in ERBB family members exhibited long_term benefit following afatinib treatment compared with patients with ERBB_wildtype tumors; there was no difference for patients treated with erlotinib (Goss et al., 2018; 29902295, Goss et al., 2021; 34195574). A meta_analysis showed that patients with ERBB4_mutated NSCLC treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors exhibited longer PFS and OS compared with patients who had ERBB4_wildtype tumors (p=0.036 and p=0.0378)(Hu et al., 2021; 34620079).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "FUBP1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "S124fs*15", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "79.48", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "S124fs*15"}}, "Interpretation": "FUBP1 encodes far upstream element binding protein 1 (also called FBP_1), a DNA_binding protein reported to have roles in transcriptional activation and splicing regulation of target genes.

FUBP1 alteration has been reported in 1.5% of samples analyzed in COSMIC, with the highest incidences reported in tumors of the endometrium (3%), central nervous system (3%), large intestine (3%), stomach (3%), liver (3%), and skin (2%) (COSMIC, 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). One study reported higher expression of FUBP1 in colorectal carcinoma tissues compared to adenoma and normal colon epithelial tissues (Jia et al., 2014; 25030436). A genetic signature defined by concomitant alterations in IDH1, CIC, and FUBP1 is associated with longer survival in patients with glioma (Jiao et al., 2012; 22869205). FUBP1 has been shown to activate the expression of MYC (Duncan et al., 1994; 8125259, Kim et al., 2003; 12819782, Weber et al., 2008; 19087307, Jang et al., 2009; 19219071), activate p27KIP1 (Zheng et al., 2011; 21855647), and regulate the splicing of MDM2 (Jacob et al., 2014; 24798327).

MERTK mutations in the context of cancer have not been an area of significant study in the scientific literature (PubMed, 2022). However, one preclinical study identified a role for MERTK P802S in enhancing cell motility (Tworkoski et al., 2013; 23617806). Mutation of MERTK has been primarily reported in desmoplastic melanoma (10%)(cBio_Shain et al., 2015; 26343386), skin cutaneous melanoma (8%), uterine carcinosarcoma (5%)(cBio_Jones et al., 2014; 25233892), and bladder urothelial carcinomas (4%), whereas putative high_level amplification of MERTK has been observed in neuroendocrine prostate cancer (8%)(cBio_Beltran et al., 2016; 26855148), esophageal carcinoma (4%), sarcoma (2%)(cBio_Barretina et al., 2010; 20601955), and at lower frequencies in other tissue types (cBioPortal, 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). In the scientific literature, MERTK overexpression has been reported in astrocytomas (Keating et al., 2010; 20423999), gliomas (Wang et al., 2013; 22469987), neuroblastomas (Li et al., 2015; 25596315), and non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)(Xie et al., 2015; 25826078, Linger et al., 2013; 22890323). Although MERTK is overexpressed in NSCLC, no association has been found between MERTK expression and survival, stage, histology, or differentiation of NSCLC tumors (Xie et al., 2015; 25826078, Linger et al., 2013; 22890323). In glioblastoma (GBM), MERTK expression has not been extensively studied in the clinical setting as a poor prognostic factor (PubMed, 2022); however, expression of the MERTK ligand, GAS6, is associated with reduced median survival of patients with GBM (Sufit et al., 2016; 27783662). In a mouse xenograft model of prostate cancer, knockdown of MERTK significantly increased metastasis_free survival (Cackowski et al., 2017; 27753136). MERTK activation may predict sensitivity to MERTK inhibitors. Multiple preclinical studies have demonstrated that inhibition of MERTK with the dual MERTK/FLT3 inhibitor, UNC2025, reduces proliferation, anchorage_independent growth and xenograft growth of GBM, NSCLC, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines (Sufit et al., 2016; 27783662, Cummings et al., 2015; 26162689, DeRyckere et al., 2017; 27649555).The multikinase inhibitor foretinib has also been observed to inhibit MERTK phoshorylation in GBM cell lines (Knubel et al., 2014; 24658326). MERTK inhibition has been shown preclinically to enhance chemosensitivity of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, neuroblastoma, and NSCLC cells (Linger et al., 2013; 22890323, Li et al., 2015; 25596315, DeRyckere et al., 2017; 27649555). Moreover, MERTK overexpression in EGFR_mutated NSCLC cells conferred resistance to erlotinib by maintaining AKT signaling (Xie et al., 2015; 25826078).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). Low_level MSI has been reported in 5_9% of glioblastoma (GBM) samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927, Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285, Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). A large_scale study did not find high_level microsatellite instability (MSI_H) in any of 129 GBM samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), although a small_scale study reported MSI_H in 4 of 15 pediatric GBMs and 1 of 12 adult GBMs (Szybka et al., 2003; 12908754). The frequency of MSI has been reported to be increased in relapsed compared to primary GBM (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), in GBMs with a previous lower grade astrocytoma (Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285), and in giant cell GBM compared to classic GBM (Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "SETD2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "D372fs*111", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "26.19", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "D372fs*111"}}, "Interpretation": "SETD2 encodes a histone lysine_36 methyltransferase (Sun et al., 2005; 16118227) that preferentially interacts with the expanded N_terminal polyglutamine tracts present in mutant huntingtin, implicating it in the pathogenesis of Huntington disease (Faber et al., 1998; 9700202). SETD2 mRNA expression has been observed to be consistently reduced in breast tumors relative to adjacent non_tumor tissue, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role (Al Sarakbi et al., 2009; 19698110). SETD2 alterations such as observed here have been shown to be inactivating (Parker et al., 2016; 27282254, Zhang et al., 2012; 22237106, McKinney et al., 2017; 28122867, Moffitt et al., 2017; 28424246, Zhu et al., 2014; 24509477, Lu et al., 2016; 27174990).

SETD2 has been associated with favorable prognosis in gastric cancer (Chen et al., 2018; 29522714). SETD2 has also been associated with poor prognosis in RCC and MDS (Chen et al., 2020; 32202636, Liu et al., 2015; 26559293), while data in other tumor types is limited (PubMed, Jun 2022).

Activation of TERT is a hallmark of cancer, being detected in up to 80_90% of malignancies and absent in quiescent cells (Shay et al., 1997; 9282118, Kim et al., 1994; 7605428, Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000; 10647931). Mutations within the promoter region of TERT that confer enhanced TERT promoter activity have been reported in two hotspots, located at _124 bp and _146 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (also termed C228T and C250T, respectively)(Horn et al., 2013; 23348503, Huang et al., 2014; 23348506, Vinagre et al., 2013; 23887589), as well as tandem mutations at positions \u2013124/\u2013125 bp and \u2013138/\u2013139 bp (Horn et al., 2013; 23348503). TERT promoter mutations have been reported in 51_59% of gliomas (Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Killela et al., 2014; 24722048), most frequently in glioblastoma (GBM, 54_84%), gliosarcoma (81%), oligodendroglioma (78%), and historically in oligoastrocytomas (25_31%) but less frequently in lower grade astrocytomas (10_18%) and in only 1% of ependymomas (Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Liu et al., 2013; 23603989, Koelsche et al., 2013; 24154961, Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Killela et al., 2014; 24722048). In patients with glioblastoma (GBM), the prevalence of TERT promoter mutation is lower in pediatric primary GBM (11%) and adult secondary GBM (28%) compared with adult primary GBM (58_83%) (Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Killela et al., 2013; 23530248). One study detected TERT promoter mutations in 78% (181/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). In the context of IDH_mutated gliomas, TERT mutations are associated with improved OS (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022)(Arita et al., 2020; 33228806). TERT promoter mutation has been shown to be significantly associated with increased TERT gene expression in astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and GBM (Arita et al., 2013; 23764841). TERT promoter mutations significantly associate with poor prognosis in patients with GBM, although this correlation may be due to the association with primary GBM as opposed to IDH_positive secondary GBM (Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Reitman et al., 2013; 24217890, Arita et al., 2013; 23764841). In the context of IDH_wildtype glioma, TERT mutations are associated with reduced OS (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022). Therapeutic options for targeting tumors with TERT mutations are limited, although a variety of approaches have been investigated, including immunotherapies using TERT as a tumor_associated antigen and antisense oligonucleotide_ or peptide_based therapies. TERT peptide vaccines showed limited anticancer efficacy in clinical trials (Zanetti et al., 2017; 27245281); however, in one preclinical study, the combination of a TERT peptide vaccine and anti_CTLA_4 therapy suppressed tumor growth (Duperret at al., 2018; 29249395). A Phase 2 study of the TERT inhibitor imetelstat for patients with advanced non_small cell lung cancer reported no improvement in PFS or OS (Chiappori et al., 2015; 25467017). Co_occurring TERT mutation, IDH mutation, and 1p/19q co_deletion is indicative of oligodendroglioma (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022)(Weller et al., 2020; 33293629). TERT mutations are associated with 1p/19q co_deletion in oligodendrogliomas, and are highly recurrent in IDH/ATRX_wildtype glioblastoma (GBM) (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022)(Weller et al., 2020; 33293629). The presence of EGFR gene amplification or TERT promoter mutations are indicative of diffuse astrocytic glioma with molecular features of glioblastoma, WHO grade 4 in IDH1/2_wildtype tumors (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022) (Louis et al., 2021; 34185076).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "R306*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "5.1", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "R306*"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). In the TCGA dataset, TP53 alterations have been reported in 35% of glioblastomas (GBMs), with a high incidence in pediatric and secondary GBMs and a low incidence in primary GBMs (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890, Jha et al., 2011; 22089350). One study detected TP53 alterations in 31% (73/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed, with most of the events being mutations (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). TP53 mutations have been reported in 18_40% of astrocytoma samples, and preferentially in anaplastic astrocytoma; one study reported TP53 loss of function and partially/fully functional mutations in 15% and 25% of anaplastic astrocytomas, respectively (Uno et al., 2005; 15914282, Uno et al., 2006; 16711514, Lass et al., 2012; 22844452, Faria et al., 2012; 23009112, Milinkovic et al., 2013; 24358143, Galatro et al., 2013; 23613880). Some studies suggest that the presence of a TP53 mutation is correlated with a favorable prognosis in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) (Schmidt et al., 2002; 11939587). One study reported that TP53 alterations were associated with poorer OS (12.9 months altered vs. 19.7 months wildtype, HR=1.58, p=0.0054) in IDH_wildtype GBM (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Mutation of TP53 is thought to be an early step in the tumorigenesis of astrocytomas, which can progress into anaplastic astrocytoma and then glioblastoma through gain of other genetic abnormalities such as loss of CDKN2A or RB1, followed by loss of PTEN (Nozaki et al., 1999; 11550308). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Touat et al., 2020; 32322066, Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556, Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642). Glioblastoma (GBM) harbors a median TMB of 2.7 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 4.2% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). For pediatric patients, high TMB has been reported in a subset of high_grade gliomas, frequently in association with mutations in mismatch repair or proofreading genes and in TP53, whereas BRAF alterations or other oncogene fusions were observed more frequently in brain tumors harboring low TMB (Patel et al., 2020; 32386112, Johnson et al., 2017; 28912153). Increased TMB has been reported to correlate with higher tumor grade in glioma (Draaisma et al., 2015; 26699864) and glioblastoma (GBM) tissue samples with biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD) (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570), as well as with shorter OS of patients with diffuse glioma (Wang et al., 2020; 32164609). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In glioma, a lack of association between TMB and clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors has been reported (Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Touat et al., 2020; 32322066). However, multiple case studies have reported that patients with ultramutated gliomas driven by POLE mutations have benefited from treatment with anti_PD_1 (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556) or anti_PD_L1 (Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642) therapies. Therefore, although increased TMB alone may not be a strong biomarker for PD_1 or PD_L1 inhibitors in this cancer type, these agents may have efficacy for patients with glioma harboring both high TMB and POLE mutation.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "IDH1", "Alteration": "R132H", "Title": "Study of LY3410738 Administered to Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors With IDH1 Mutations", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "PD_L1, IDH2, IDH1", "Locations": "Taichung City (Taiwan), Tainan (Taiwan), Hong Kong (Hong Kong), Seoul (Korea, Republic of), Suita_shi (Japan), Nagaizumi (Japan), Yokohama (Japan), Chuo_ku (Japan), Kashiwa (Japan), Singapore (Singapore)", "NCTID": "NCT04521686", "Note": "IDH1 mutations may predict sensitivity to IDH1 inhibitors.
