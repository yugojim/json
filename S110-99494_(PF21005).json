CDK4 and its functional homolog CDK6 are activated by D_type cyclins and promote cell cycle progression by inactivating the tumor suppressor Rb (Weinberg et al., 1995; 7736585, Musgrove et al., 2011; 21734724). Amplification of the chromosomal region that includes CDK4 has been reported in multiple cancer types, including lung cancer, glioblastoma, and liposarcoma, and has been associated with overexpression of CDK4 protein (Wikman et al., 2005; 15543620, Rao et al., 2010; 19609742, Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Chung et al., 2009; 19574885, Ragazzini et al., 2004; 15024701, Dujardin et al., 2011; 21336260, Zhang et al., 2013; 23393200, Horvai et al., 2009; 19734852). Across TCGA and MKSCC studies, CDK4 amplification has been reported in 4.0_9.4% of glioma cases and 14% of glioblastoma multiforme cases (cBioPortal, Sep 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031, Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661). A study has reported amplification of the 12q14_15 region, where CDK4 and MDM2 reside, in 5% (2/42) of glioblastomas (Zheng et al., 2013; 23796897). Amplification of CDK4 and corresponding increased CDK4 protein expression has been reported to be associated with a poorer patient outcome in anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma (Kim et al., 2010; 20080666, Ruano et al., 2009; 19141386, Fischer et al., 2008; 18403636, B\u00e4cklund et al., 2005; 15970925). CDK4 amplification or activation may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors such as abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib (Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27217383, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767). Clinical benefit has been reported for limited tumor types including patients with CDK4_amplified liposarcoma and sarcoma in response to treatment with abemaciclib (Dickson et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 11004), palbociclib (Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Dickson et al., 2016; 27124835), and ribociclib (Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528). On the basis of a Phase 1b study, PTEN loss of expression may be associated with resistance to combination therapy with CDK4/6 inhibitors such as ribociclib and aromatase inhibitors such as letrozole (Costa et al., 2019; 31594766).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT03239015", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03099174", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04594005", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03834740", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02933736", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03994796", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04116541", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02981940", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02896335", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "EGFR", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": [{"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "EGFR encodes the epidermal growth factor receptor, which belongs to a class of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases. In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). Amplification of EGFR has been associated with increased expression of EGFR mRNA and protein in several cancer types (Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Bhargava et al., 2005; 15920544, Yang et al., 2012; 22490401). Disruption of the EGFR C_terminal region through deletion (Cho et al., 2011; 22001862, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Pines et al., 2010; 20676128), truncation (Cho et al., 2011; 22001862, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Wang et al., 2007; 17643422), splicing errors (Cho et al., 2011; 22001862, Wang et al., 2007; 17643422), or gene fusion (Frattini et al., 2013; 23917401, FMI_Konduri et al., 2016; 27102076), has been demonstrated to be activating and is likely to be oncogenic. These mutations have been shown to cause cellular transformation and tumor formation and to be sensitive to EGFR_targeting therapies, including erlotinib, lapatinib, and cetuximab (Cho et al., 2011; 22001862, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Pines et al., 2010; 20676128, Frattini et al., 2013; 23917401, FMI_Konduri et al., 2016; 27102076). One or more of the alterations observed here are predicted to be activating. Across several genomic studies of CNS tumors, EGFR alterations have been reported in 13.2% of anaplastic astrocytomas, 5.3_15.9% of glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs), and 0% of pilocytic astrocytomas (cbio_Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031, cbio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, cbio_Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, cbio_Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509). Across several genomic studies of CNS tumors, EGFR amplification has been reported in 16.9% of anaplastic astrocytomas, and 39.7% of glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs)(Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031, Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509). EGFR amplification and/or EGFR expression in glioma has been correlated with poor overall survival in patients under 60 years of age, prolonged survival in patients over the age of 60, and tumor grade (Smith et al., 2001; 11504770, Shinojima et al., 2003; 14583498, Ambroise et al., 2010; 21133628, Hobbs et al., 2012; 22472960). A patient with multiple glioblastoma (GBM) tumors, one of which harbored EGFRvIII, experienced progression of the EGFRvIII_positive tumor during treatment with osimertinib (Makhlin et al., 2019; 31769726). Clinical studies of the second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified gliomas have shown limited efficacy (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Blumenthal et al., 2016; 27531351); however, a small subset of patients has experienced clinical benefit (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). The second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib have shown minimal efficacy for patients with EGFRvIII glioblastoma (GBM)(Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Alshami et al., 2015; 26423602, Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). A Phase 1/2 study of afatinib, temozolomide, or the combination for patients with GBM reported clinical benefit, including for patients with EGFRvIII; however, temozolomide alone and in combination exhibited better responses than afatinib monotherapy (Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Alshami et al., 2015; 26423602). A Phase 2 trial of dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified GBM reported a DCR of 26% (5/19) among patients with EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII; however, the trial failed to meet its primary endpoint of 6_month PFS (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464). A retrospective biomarker analysis of another Phase 2 study of dacomitinib for patients with GBM found no association between EGFRvIII and clinical benefit (Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). A Phase 1 trial of ABT_414, an EGFR_targeted antibody_drug conjugate with a toxic payload, in patients with GBM reported 2 complete responses (CR) and 5 partial responses (PR) in 18 patients with EGFR amplification (39% response rate); no CR or PR were observed in 28 patients without EGFR amplification (Gan et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 2016). A clinical study of patients with GBM treated with gefitinib or erlotinib found no correlation between EGFR amplification or mutation and response to the therapy, but sensitivity to EGFR kinase inhibitors was associated with the co_expression of the EGFRvIII alteration and PTEN (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176). Activation of multiple ERBB family receptors or activation of the PI3K pathway may be responsible for resistance to EGFR_targeted therapy in GBM; therefore, inhibition of ERBB family members or treatment with PI3K/AKT inhibitors or mTOR inhibitors such as everolimus or temsirolimus in combination with an EGFR_targeted treatment, may be a therapeutic option (Clark et al., 2012; 22745588, Fenton et al., 2012; 22891331). In multiple glioblastoma (GBM) studies, the presence of EGFRvIII has not predicted clinical benefit from first_generation EGFR TKIs such as erlotinib (Van den Bent et al., 2009; 19204207, Haas_Kogen et al., 2005; 15956649, Brown et al., 2008; 18955445, Preusser et al., 2008; 18458820, Wen et al., 2014; 24470557, Gallego et al., 2013; 24352766) or gefitinib (Rich et al. 2004; 14638850, Uhm et al., 2011; 20510539, Preusser et al., 2008; 18458820). However, case reports have described patients with EGFRvIII_positive GBM responding to erlotinib (Doyle et al., 2018; 30410775, D Alessandris et al., 2013; 23132371, Custodio and Perez_Segura, 2010; 20462843, D Alessandris et al., 2018; 30306271). In a retrospective study of patients with GBM treated with erlotinib or gefitinib, co_expression of EGFRvIII with PTEN protein was the strongest predictor of response (P<0.001)(Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176), suggesting that activity in this setting is dependent on PTEN status (Mellinghoff et al., 2007; 17255257, Arif et al., 2018; 29492119). However, a prospective Phase 2 trial testing erlotinib monotherapy for patients with EGFRvIII and PTEN_positive recurrent glioblastoma reported minimal efficacy and was terminated (Gallego et al., 2013; 24352766). Multiple studies have failed to find a positive association between increased EGFR expression and clinical benefit from erlotinib or gefitinib for patients with glioblastoma (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176, Franceschi et al., 2007; 17353924, Chakravarti et al., 2013; 23182702, Hegi et al., 2011; 21471286, Rich et al. 2004; 14638850). Case studies of patients with cancers harboring EGFR rearrangements treated with osimertinib have reported mixed results. Of 3 patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR kinase domain duplication (KDD), 2 attained PRs with osimertinib, whereas the third experienced PD (Wang et al., 2018; 30255937, Kim et al., 2021; DOI: 10.1200/PO.20.00296). A patient with multiple glioblastoma (GBM) tumors, one of which harbored EGFRvIII, experienced progression of the EGFRvIII_positive tumor during treatment with osimertinib (Makhlin et al., 2019; 31769726). Third_generation EGFR inhibitors, such as osimertinib, selectively target mutated EGFR, including EGFR T790M (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549, Soria et al., 2018; 29151359). EGFR amplification or expression may be associated with benefit from anti_EGFR antibodies, such as cetuximab (Pirker et al., 2011; 22056021, Jiang et al., 2013; 23441167, Licitra et al., 2011; 21048039, Herbst et al., 2018; 29169877), panitumumab (Jiang et al., 2013; 23441167), or necitumumab (Paz_Ares et al., 2016; 27207107). Necitumumab is an anti_EGFR antibody that is approved to treat metastatic squamous NSCLC in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin (Thatcher et al., 2015; 26045340, Paz_Ares et al., 2015; 25701171) that has also shown benefit in patients with CRC and melanoma (Elez et al., 2016; 26766738, Kuenen et al., 2010; 20197484). Irreversible EGFR inhibitors, as well as HSP90 inhibitors, may be appropriate for patients with de novo or acquired resistance to EGFR_targeted therapy (Shimamura et al., 2005; 16024644, Shimamura et al., 2008; 18632637, Sawai et al., 2008; 18199556, Janne et al., 2015; 25923649). Preclinical studies have reported that EGFR_mutant cells (Shimamura et al., 2005; 16024644, Shimamura et al., 2008; 18632637, Sawai et al., 2008; 18199556), including cells with exon 20 insertions (Xu et al., 2007; 17712310), are sensitive to HSP90 inhibitors. Consistent with preclinical data demonstrating that the EGFR inhibitor AZD3759 is capable of penetrating the blood_brain barrier and reducing the volume of brain and leptomeningeal metastases, preliminary results from a Phase 1 trial evaluating single_agent AZD3759 reported a reduction in the volume of brain metastases in 40.0% (8/20) of patients with previously treated NSCLC harboring either EGFR L858R or EGFR exon 19 deletion, including 3 confirmed PRs and 3 unconfirmed PRs (Ahn et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9003, Zeng et al., 2015; 26313252,Yang et al., 2016; 27928026). In a Phase 1/2 trial for advanced NSCLC, the brain_penetrant third_generation EGFR TKI lazertinib enabled ORRs of 54.3% (69/127) for all evaluable patients and 44.4% (8/18, intracranial) for patients with brain metastases (Ahn et al., 2019; ASCO 31587882). The reovirus Reolysin targets cells with activated RAS signaling (Strong et al., 1998; 9628872, Coffey et al., 1998; 9812900, Gong and Mita, 2014; 25019061) and is in clinical trials for patients with some tumor types. Reolysin has demonstrated mixed clinical efficacy, with the highest rate of response reported for patients with head and neck cancer (Forsyth et al., 2008; 18253152, Vidal et al., 2008; 18981012, Gollamudi et al., 2010; 19572105, Harrington et al., 2010; 20484020, Comins et al., 2010; 20926400, Lolkema et al., 2011; 21106728, Galanis et al., 2012; 22871663, Karapanagiotou et al., 2012; 22316603, Morris et al., 2013; 22886613).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

Two Phase 2 studies of panitumumab and chemotherapy in biliary tract cancer, including cholangiocarcinoma, reported encouraging efficacy and manageable toxicity (Jensen et al., 2012; 22367707, Sohal et al., 2013; 24146220). In a Phase 2 trial of advanced NSCLC, the addition of panitumumab to paclitaxel/carboplatin did not result in improved clinical benefit (Crawford et al., 2013; 24389433).

One or more of the alterations observed here are predicted to be activating. Across several genomic studies of CNS tumors, EGFR alterations have been reported in 13.2% of anaplastic astrocytomas, 5.3_15.9% of glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs), and 0% of pilocytic astrocytomas (cbio_Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031, cbio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, cbio_Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, cbio_Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509). Across several genomic studies of CNS tumors, EGFR amplification has been reported in 16.9% of anaplastic astrocytomas, and 39.7% of glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs)(Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031, Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509). EGFR amplification and/or EGFR expression in glioma has been correlated with poor overall survival in patients under 60 years of age, prolonged survival in patients over the age of 60, and tumor grade (Smith et al., 2001; 11504770, Shinojima et al., 2003; 14583498, Ambroise et al., 2010; 21133628, Hobbs et al., 2012; 22472960). A patient with multiple glioblastoma (GBM) tumors, one of which harbored EGFRvIII, experienced progression of the EGFRvIII_positive tumor during treatment with osimertinib (Makhlin et al., 2019; 31769726). Clinical studies of the second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified gliomas have shown limited efficacy (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Blumenthal et al., 2016; 27531351); however, a small subset of patients has experienced clinical benefit (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). The second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib have shown minimal efficacy for patients with EGFRvIII glioblastoma (GBM)(Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Alshami et al., 2015; 26423602, Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). A Phase 1/2 study of afatinib, temozolomide, or the combination for patients with GBM reported clinical benefit, including for patients with EGFRvIII; however, temozolomide alone and in combination exhibited better responses than afatinib monotherapy (Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Alshami et al., 2015; 26423602). A Phase 2 trial of dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified GBM reported a DCR of 26% (5/19) among patients with EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII; however, the trial failed to meet its primary endpoint of 6_month PFS (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464). A retrospective biomarker analysis of another Phase 2 study of dacomitinib for patients with GBM found no association between EGFRvIII and clinical benefit (Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). A Phase 1 trial of ABT_414, an EGFR_targeted antibody_drug conjugate with a toxic payload, in patients with GBM reported 2 complete responses (CR) and 5 partial responses (PR) in 18 patients with EGFR amplification (39% response rate); no CR or PR were observed in 28 patients without EGFR amplification (Gan et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 2016). A clinical study of patients with GBM treated with gefitinib or erlotinib found no correlation between EGFR amplification or mutation and response to the therapy, but sensitivity to EGFR kinase inhibitors was associated with the co_expression of the EGFRvIII alteration and PTEN (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176). Activation of multiple ERBB family receptors or activation of the PI3K pathway may be responsible for resistance to EGFR_targeted therapy in GBM; therefore, inhibition of ERBB family members or treatment with PI3K/AKT inhibitors or mTOR inhibitors such as everolimus or temsirolimus in combination with an EGFR_targeted treatment, may be a therapeutic option (Clark et al., 2012; 22745588, Fenton et al., 2012; 22891331). In multiple glioblastoma (GBM) studies, the presence of EGFRvIII has not predicted clinical benefit from first_generation EGFR TKIs such as erlotinib (Van den Bent et al., 2009; 19204207, Haas_Kogen et al., 2005; 15956649, Brown et al., 2008; 18955445, Preusser et al., 2008; 18458820, Wen et al., 2014; 24470557, Gallego et al., 2013; 24352766) or gefitinib (Rich et al. 2004; 14638850, Uhm et al., 2011; 20510539, Preusser et al., 2008; 18458820). However, case reports have described patients with EGFRvIII_positive GBM responding to erlotinib (Doyle et al., 2018; 30410775, D Alessandris et al., 2013; 23132371, Custodio and Perez_Segura, 2010; 20462843, D Alessandris et al., 2018; 30306271). In a retrospective study of patients with GBM treated with erlotinib or gefitinib, co_expression of EGFRvIII with PTEN protein was the strongest predictor of response (P<0.001)(Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176), suggesting that activity in this setting is dependent on PTEN status (Mellinghoff et al., 2007; 17255257, Arif et al., 2018; 29492119). However, a prospective Phase 2 trial testing erlotinib monotherapy for patients with EGFRvIII and PTEN_positive recurrent glioblastoma reported minimal efficacy and was terminated (Gallego et al., 2013; 24352766). Multiple studies have failed to find a positive association between increased EGFR expression and clinical benefit from erlotinib or gefitinib for patients with glioblastoma (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176, Franceschi et al., 2007; 17353924, Chakravarti et al., 2013; 23182702, Hegi et al., 2011; 21471286, Rich et al. 2004; 14638850). Case studies of patients with cancers harboring EGFR rearrangements treated with osimertinib have reported mixed results. Of 3 patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR kinase domain duplication (KDD), 2 attained PRs with osimertinib, whereas the third experienced PD (Wang et al., 2018; 30255937, Kim et al., 2021; DOI: 10.1200/PO.20.00296). A patient with multiple glioblastoma (GBM) tumors, one of which harbored EGFRvIII, experienced progression of the EGFRvIII_positive tumor during treatment with osimertinib (Makhlin et al., 2019; 31769726). Third_generation EGFR inhibitors, such as osimertinib, selectively target mutated EGFR, including EGFR T790M (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549, Soria et al., 2018; 29151359). EGFR amplification or expression may be associated with benefit from anti_EGFR antibodies, such as cetuximab (Pirker et al., 2011; 22056021, Jiang et al., 2013; 23441167, Licitra et al., 2011; 21048039, Herbst et al., 2018; 29169877), panitumumab (Jiang et al., 2013; 23441167), or necitumumab (Paz_Ares et al., 2016; 27207107). Necitumumab is an anti_EGFR antibody that is approved to treat metastatic squamous NSCLC in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin (Thatcher et al., 2015; 26045340, Paz_Ares et al., 2015; 25701171) that has also shown benefit in patients with CRC and melanoma (Elez et al., 2016; 26766738, Kuenen et al., 2010; 20197484). Irreversible EGFR inhibitors, as well as HSP90 inhibitors, may be appropriate for patients with de novo or acquired resistance to EGFR_targeted therapy (Shimamura et al., 2005; 16024644, Shimamura et al., 2008; 18632637, Sawai et al., 2008; 18199556, Janne et al., 2015; 25923649). Preclinical studies have reported that EGFR_mutant cells (Shimamura et al., 2005; 16024644, Shimamura et al., 2008; 18632637, Sawai et al., 2008; 18199556), including cells with exon 20 insertions (Xu et al., 2007; 17712310), are sensitive to HSP90 inhibitors. Consistent with preclinical data demonstrating that the EGFR inhibitor AZD3759 is capable of penetrating the blood_brain barrier and reducing the volume of brain and leptomeningeal metastases, preliminary results from a Phase 1 trial evaluating single_agent AZD3759 reported a reduction in the volume of brain metastases in 40.0% (8/20) of patients with previously treated NSCLC harboring either EGFR L858R or EGFR exon 19 deletion, including 3 confirmed PRs and 3 unconfirmed PRs (Ahn et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9003, Zeng et al., 2015; 26313252,Yang et al., 2016; 27928026). In a Phase 1/2 trial for advanced NSCLC, the brain_penetrant third_generation EGFR TKI lazertinib enabled ORRs of 54.3% (69/127) for all evaluable patients and 44.4% (8/18, intracranial) for patients with brain metastases (Ahn et al., 2019; ASCO 31587882). The reovirus Reolysin targets cells with activated RAS signaling (Strong et al., 1998; 9628872, Coffey et al., 1998; 9812900, Gong and Mita, 2014; 25019061) and is in clinical trials for patients with some tumor types. Reolysin has demonstrated mixed clinical efficacy, with the highest rate of response reported for patients with head and neck cancer (Forsyth et al., 2008; 18253152, Vidal et al., 2008; 18981012, Gollamudi et al., 2010; 19572105, Harrington et al., 2010; 20484020, Comins et al., 2010; 20926400, Lolkema et al., 2011; 21106728, Galanis et al., 2012; 22871663, Karapanagiotou et al., 2012; 22316603, Morris et al., 2013; 22886613).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

Two Phase 2 studies of panitumumab and chemotherapy in biliary tract cancer, including cholangiocarcinoma, reported encouraging efficacy and manageable toxicity (Jensen et al., 2012; 22367707, Sohal et al., 2013; 24146220). In a Phase 2 trial of advanced NSCLC, the addition of panitumumab to paclitaxel/carboplatin did not result in improved clinical benefit (Crawford et al., 2013; 24389433).

In preclinical trials, cetuximab, matuzumab, and panitumumab were reported to be ineffective at blocking EGFR dimerization and activation in GBM cells expressing EGFR extracellular domain mutations (Gajadhar et al., 2012; 22232519). However, another study demonstrated that in patients with GBM harboring EGFR amplification but lacking expression of the EGFRvIII variant, treatment with cetuximab resulted in significantly better progression_free survival (PFS) and numerical (although not statistically significant) improvement in overall survival (OS) (Lv et al., 2012; 22752145). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT03829436", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02800486", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03783403", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02451553", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT01552434", "Include": "true"}]}}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "MDM2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "MDM2 encodes an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p53, Rb1, and other proteins (Sdek et al., 2005; 16337594, Brady et al., 2005; 15632057, Li et al., 2004; 15053880). MDM2 acts to prevent the activity of the tumor suppressor p53; therefore, overexpression or amplification of MDM2 may be oncogenic (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675, Cordon_Cardo et al., 1994; 8306343). Overexpression or amplification of MDM2 is frequent in cancer (Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). Although two retrospective clinical studies suggest that MDM2 amplification may predict a short time_to_treatment failure on anti_PD_1/PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors, with 4/5 patients with MDM2 amplification (Kato et al., 2017; 28351930) and 2/3 patients with MDM2 or MDM4 amplification (Singavi et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 1140PD) experiencing tumor hyperprogression, amplification of MDM2 or MDM4 was not associated with shorter progression_free survival (PFS) in a retrospective analysis of non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) outcomes with immune checkpoint inhibitors (hazard ratio of 1.4, p=0.44)(Rizvi et al., 2018; 29337640). The latter study reported PFS of >2 months for 5/8 patients with MDM2/MDM4 amplification (Rizvi et al., 2018; 29337640). In the Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) TCGA dataset, amplification of MDM2 has been found in 8% of cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). A study has reported amplification of the 12q14_15 region, where MDM2 and CDK4 reside, in 5% (2/42) of GBMs (Zheng et al., 2013; 23796897). Amplification of MDM2 has been associated with poor survival in patients with glioblastoma (Fischer et al., 2010; 19839052, Zheng et al., 2013; 23796897). MDM2 antagonists disrupt the MDM2_p53 interaction, thereby stabilizing p53 (Cheok et al., 2011; 20975744). Preclinical studies have suggested that the amplification of MDM2, in the absence of concurrent TP53 mutations, may increase sensitivity to these agents (Ohnstad et al., 2013; 23165797, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357). Preliminary Phase 1 studies of the MDM2_p53 antagonist alrizomadlin (APG_115) reported a PR in a patient with liposarcoma harboring an MDM2 amplification and wildtype for TP53 and SD in 21%\u201338% (6/28 and 5/13, respectively) of patients in genomically unselected solid tumors (Zhang et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3124, Rasco et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3126). A Phase 2 trial of alrizomadlin in combination with pembrolizumab reported a PR in 1 of 3 patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor that had failed standard therapy, as well as PRs in patients with multiple types of solid tumors that had failed immunotherapy, including 1 out of 14 patients with non_small cell lung cancer; 1 out of 5 patients with urothelial carcinoma; and 2 out of5, 1 out of 5, and 1 out of 11 patients with mucosal, uveal, and cutaneous melanoma, respectively (Tolcher et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 2506). Phase 1b studies of the MDM2 inhibitor idasanutlin for refractory AML in combination with cytarabine or venetoclax reported anti_leukemic response rates of 33% (25/75) and 37% (11/30), respectively (Martinelli et al., 2016; EHA21 Abstract S504, Daver et al., 2018; ASH Abstract 767); clinical benefit (58% ORR, 7/12) with idasanutlin monotherapy has been reported for patients with polycythemia vera (Mascarenhas et al., 2019; ASH Abstract 134). The dual MDM2/MDM4 inhibitor ALRN_6924 led to an ORR of 27% (4/15) for patients with TP53 wildtype peripheral T_cell lymphoma in a Phase 2 study (Shustov et al., 2018; ASH Abstract 1623); responses have also been observed in TP53 wildtype AML, MDS, Merkel cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and liposarcoma (Sallman et al., 2018; ASH Abstract 4066, Meric_Bernstam et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 2505).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Inhibitors of the MDM2_p53 interaction are being tested in clinical trials.

Studies in the literature have indicated that PTEN alterations (mutation or homozygous deletion) occur most frequently in glioblastoma (GBM), less frequently in anaplastic astrocytoma, and rarely in lower grade glioma subtypes including low grade astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, oligoastrocytoma, and ependymoma (Zhou et al., 1999; 10096247, Rasheed et al., 1997; 9331072, Davies et al., 1999; 10188904, Smith et al., 2001; 11504770, Lin et al., 1998; 9796977, Schmidt et al., 1999; 10560660, Kato et al., 2000; 11051241, Furnari et al., 2007; 17974913). One study detected PTEN mutation in 42% (97/232) and loss in 10% (24/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). In the TCGA dataset, PTEN mutation was observed in 23% of GBM cases and PTEN deletion was reported in 7% of cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142), while in the Lower Grade Glioma TCGA dataset, PTEN mutation was observed in 4% of cases and homozygous deletion observed in 1.2% of cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751). Loss of PTEN correlated with significantly worse prognosis in all grades of gliomas (Lin et al., 1998; 9796977, Srividya et al., 2011; 21134002). PTEN loss or mutation leads to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway (Courtney et al., 2010; 20085938, Simpson and Parsons, 2001; 11237521, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Milella et al., 2017; 28220839). Across various tissues, most clinical studies have not observed an association between PTEN deficiency and response to inhibitors of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway. However, limited studies in prostate cancer (Templeton et al., 2013; 23582881, Sweeney et al., 2021; 34246347, de Bono et al., 2019; 30037818, Saura et al., 2017; 27872130), renal cell carcinoma (Voss et al., 2019; 30327302), breast cancer (Andre et al., 2016; 27091708, Dent et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 1008, Schmid et al., 2020; 31841354), and colorectal cancer (Gilcrease et al., 2019; 30302599) have reported an association between PTEN deficiency and response to inhibitors targeting the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway. Preclinical data indicate that PTEN loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Mendes_Pereira et al., 2009; 20049735, Shen et al., 2013; 23881923, Chatterjee et al., 2013; 23565244, McCormick et al., 2016; 26905328, Forster et al., 2011; 21468130), and clinical benefit has been observed for patients with PTEN_altered breast cancer including triple negative breast cancer (Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006, Eikesdal et al., 2021; 33242536), ovarian cancer (Dougherty et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 5536), uterine leiomyosarcoma (Pan et al., 2021; 33970096), and endometrial cancer (Forster et al., 2011; 21468130) treated with PARP inhibitors. However, some studies have reported a lack of association between PTEN mutation and PARP inhibitor sensitivity (Sandhu et al., 2013; 23810788, Romero et al., 2020; 32988624, Piha_Paul et al., 2018; AACR Abstract A096). On the basis of a Phase 1b study, PTEN loss of expression may be associated with resistance to combination therapy with CDK4/6 inhibitors such as ribociclib and aromatase inhibitors such as letrozole (Costa et al., 2019; 31594766). Limited clinical evidence in glioblastoma (Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Peiwen et al., 2019; AACR Abstract A060), leiomyosarcoma (George et al., 2017; 28228279), and melanoma (Peng et al., 2016; 26645196) suggests that PTEN alterations may predict a lack of response to anti_PD_1 therapy. In an analysis of 39 patients with metastatic melanoma treated with pembrolizumab or nivolumab, patients with PTEN_expressing tumors achieved significantly greater reduction of tumor size than those with reduction or loss of PTEN expression (Peng et al., 2016; 26645196). In a retrospective analysis of 66 patients with glioblastoma, tumors from nivolumab or pembrolizumab non_responders were significantly enriched for PTEN mutations (Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Peiwen et al., 2019; AACR Abstract A060). In a patient with uterine leiomyosarcoma treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy, a treatment_resistant tumor arose that harbored PTEN loss (George et al., 2017; 28228279). PTEN mutations underlie several inherited disorders, collectively termed PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS), which include Cowden syndrome (CS) and its variant Lhermitte_Duclos disease (LD), Bannayan_Riley_Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), PTEN_related Proteus syndrome (PS), and Proteus_like syndrome (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191, Orloff and Eng, 2008; 18794875). The mutation rate for PTEN in these disorders ranges from 20 to 85% of patients (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191, Zbuk and Eng, 2007; 17167516). The estimated incidence of Cowden syndrome is 1/200,000, which may be an underestimate due to the high variability of this disorder (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191). Given the association between PTEN and these inherited syndromes, in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing for mutations affecting PTEN is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PTEN loss or inactivating mutations may lead to increased activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI_High has been reported in 3_8% of adult or pediatric astrocytomas and was generally not associated with Lynch syndrome (Alonso et al., 2001; 11280776, Rodr\u00edguez_Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2013; 24073290, Vladimirova et al., 2008; 18053027). Low_level MSI has been reported in 5_9% of glioblastoma (GBM) samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927, Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285, Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). A large_scale study did not find high_level microsatellite instability (MSI_H) in any of 129 GBM samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), although a small_scale study reported MSI_H in 4 of 15 pediatric GBMs and 1 of 12 adult GBMs (Szybka et al., 2003; 12908754). The frequency of MSI has been reported to be increased in relapsed compared to primary GBM (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), in GBMs with a previous lower grade astrocytoma (Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285), and in giant cell GBM compared to classic GBM (Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "00", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "00"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Touat et al., 2020; 32322066, Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556, Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642). Anaplastic astrocytoma harbors a median TMB of 1.8 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 2% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). For pediatric patients, high TMB has been reported in a subset of high_grade gliomas, frequently in association with mutations in mismatch repair or proofreading genes and in TP53, whereas BRAF alterations or other oncogene fusions were observed more frequently in brain tumors harboring low TMB (Patel et al., 2020; 32386112, Johnson et al., 2017; 28912153). Increased TMB has been reported to correlate with higher tumor grade in glioma (Draaisma et al., 2015; 26699864) and glioblastoma (GBM) tissue samples with biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD) (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570), as well as with shorter OS of patients with diffuse glioma (Wang et al., 2020; 32164609). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In glioma, a lack of association between TMB and clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors has been reported (Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Touat et al., 2020; 32322066). However, multiple case studies have reported that patients with ultramutated gliomas driven by POLE mutations have benefited from treatment with anti_PD_1 (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556) or anti_PD_L1 (Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642) therapies.
