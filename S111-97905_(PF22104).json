Mutation, loss, or inactivation of ARID1A has been reported in many cancers, and the gene is considered a tumor suppressor (Guan et al., 2011; 21900401, Jones et al., 2012; 22009941, Wiegand et al., 2010; 20942669, Jones et al., 2010; 20826764, Yan et al., 2014; 24293408, Wang et al., 2012; 22808142, Huang et al., 2012; 22922871, Chan_On et al., 2013; 24185513, Mamo et al., 2012; 21892209). ARID1A mutations, which are mostly truncating, have been identified along the entire gene and often correlate with ARID1A protein loss (Jones et al., 2012; 22009941, Wiegand et al., 2010; 20942669, Jones et al., 2010; 20826764, Zang et al., 2012; 22484628, Wang et al., 2011; 22037554), whereas ARID1A missense mutations are mostly uncharacterized. ARID1A alterations are particularly prevalent in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (46_50%), ovarian and uterine endometrioid carcinomas (24_44%), and cholangiocarcinoma (27%); they are also reported in up to 27% of gastric carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, pediatric Burkitt lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, and urothelial carcinoma samples analyzed (COSMIC, cBioPortal, Jan 2022) (Tate et al., 2019; 30371878, Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Wu et al., 2014; 24618703, Jones et al., 2012; 22009941, Dulak et al., 2013; 23525077, Streppel et al., 2013; 23318448, Jiao et al., 2014; 24293293, Ross et al., 2014; 24563076). ARID1A loss is associated with microsatellite instability in ovarian and endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinomas (Huang et al., 2014; 25195947, Hussein et al., 2014; 25394778, Bosse et al., 2013; 23702729, Allo et al., 2014; 23887303, Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729), CRC (Chou et al., 2014; 24925223, Ye et al., 2014; 25311944, Wei et al., 2014; 25561809, Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729), and gastric cancer (Chen et al., 2015; 25583476, Wang et al., 2011; 22037554, Abe et al., 2012; 22915242, Wang et al., 2012; 22808142, Wiegand et al., 2014; 24767857, Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729). ARID1A protein loss is associated with tumors of poor histological grade for many tumor types, including colorectal cancer (CRC) (Chou et al., 2014; 24925223, Ye et al., 2014; 25311944, Wei et al., 2014; 25561809), cervical cancer (Katagiri et al., 2012; 22274316, Cho et al., 2013; 23427874), gastric cancer (Chen et al., 2015; 25583476, Wang et al., 2011; 22037554, Abe et al., 2012; 22915242, Wang et al., 2012; 22808142, Wiegand et al., 2014; 24767857), urothelial carcinoma (Gui et al., 2011; 21822268, Balbas_Martinez et al., 2013; 23650517, Faraj et al., 2014; 25175170), ovarian and endometrial cancers (Rahman et al., 2013; 22939958, Maeda et al., 2010; 21614196, Lowery et al., 2012; 22193641, Fadare et al., 2013; 23524907, Mao et al., 2013; 24076775, Katagiri et al., 2012; 22101352, Huang et al., 2014; 25195947, Hussein et al., 2014; 25394778, Bosse et al., 2013; 23702729, Allo et al., 2014; 23887303), breast carcinoma (Zhang et al., 2012; 21889920, Mamo et al., 2012; 21892209, Zhao et al., 2014; 24430365), and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (Lichner et al., 2013; 23416164); ARID1A mutation has been associated with poor outcomes for patients with cholangiocarcinoma (Feng et al., 2021; 33387086, Conci et al., 2020; 32020551, Simbolo et al., 2018; 29740198, Ruzzenente et al., 2016; 26717940). However, prognostic data regarding patient survival are often mixed and conflicting. There are no therapies approved to address the mutation or loss of ARID1A in cancer. However, on the basis of limited clinical and preclinical evidence, ARID1A inactivating mutations may lead to sensitivity to ATR inhibitors such as M6620 and ceralasertib (Williamson et al., 2016; 27958275). In a Phase 2 study of ceralasertib in solid tumors, 2 patients with endometrial carcinoma in the cohort with loss of ARID1A expression achieved CRs on ceralasertib monotherapy; at least 1 of these 2 patients carried an inactivating ARID1A mutation. In contrast, no responses were observed for patients with normal ARID1A expression treated with ceralasertib combined with olaparib (Aggarwal et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 512O). One patient with small cell lung cancer harboring an ARID1A mutation experienced a PR when treated with M6620 combined with topotecan (Thomas et al., 2018; 29252124). In a Phase 1 trial, a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer harboring both an ARID1A mutation and ATM loss treated with single_agent M6620 achieved a CR that was ongoing at 29 months (Yap et al., 2020; 32568634). On the basis of limited preclinical evidence from studies in ovarian cancer, ARID1A inactivation may predict sensitivity to EZH2 inhibitors (Bitler et al., 2015; 25686104, Kim et al., 2015; 26552009), which are under investigation in clinical trials. Other studies have reported that the loss of ARID1A may activate the PI3K_AKT pathway and be linked with sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway (Wiegand et al., 2014; 24559118, Huang et al., 2014; 24336158, Samartzis et al., 2014; 24979463). Patients with ARID1A alterations in advanced or metastatic solid tumors may derive benefit from treatment with anti_PD_1 or anti_PD_L1 immunotherapy (Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729). Loss of ARID1A expression has been associated with chemoresistance to platinum_based therapy for patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma (Yokoyama et al., 2014; 24459582, Katagiri et al., 2012; 22101352) and to 5_fluorouracil in colorectal cancer cell lines (Xie et al., 2014; 24833095).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "ARID1A loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to ATR inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT02264678", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04802174", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04657068", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04491942", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04514497", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04616534", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04266912", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03669601", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02595931", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "KRAS", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "G12D", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "G12D"}}, "Interpretation": "KRAS encodes a member of the RAS family of small GTPases.

Studies have reported KRAS mutations in 10_38% of non_small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), including 27_37% of lung adenocarcinomas (cBio_Ding et al., 2008; 18948947, cBio_Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, Aviel_Ronen et al., 2006; 16870043, Villaruz et al., 2013; 23526491, Rekhtman et al., 2013; 23619604, Ragusa et al., 2013; 23357969, Kim et al., 2013; 23307237, Russell et al., 2013; 23486266, Stella et al., 2013; 23644698, Cai et al., 2013; 23495083, Yip et al., 2013; 23392229), 10.5_33% of lung adenosquamous carcinomas (Tochigi et al., 2011; 21502435, Shu et al., 2013; 22996376, Wang et al., 2014; 24481316), 22% of lung large cell carcinoma without neuroendocrine features, and 6% of lung large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (Karlsson et al., 2015; 26124082). KRAS mutation in lung adenocarcinoma has been correlated with disease progression, poorly differentiated tumors, and aggressive tumor behavior (NCCN NSCLC Guidelines, v3.2022)(Yip et al., 2013; 23392229, Rekhtman et al., 2013; 23619604, Scoccianti et al., 2012; 22267755). However, the prognostic value of KRAS mutation in lung adenocarcinoma may differ among ethnic groups and may depend upon the specific allelic variant present (T\u00edm\u00e1r, 2014; 24463346). KRAS mutation was associated with shorter PFS (7.0 vs. 8.6 months, p=0.026) and OS (14.2 vs. 21.6 months, p=0.019) with first_line treatment with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in a retrospective study (Ghimessy et al., 2019; 31600989) and a lower major pathological response rate (0% [0/10] vs. 35.5% [11/31]) after neoadjuvant bevacizumab plus chemotherapy followed by adjuvant bevacizumab in a Phase 2 trial (Chaft et al., 2013; 23857398), relative to those patients lacking KRAS mutation. However, addition of atezolizumab to first_line bevacizumab and chemotherapy improved PFS regardless of KRAS status in the Phase 3 IMpower150 study (HR=0.50 for KRAS mutant vs. 0.47 for KRAS wild_type vs. 0.67 for KRAS unknown) (Socinski et al., 2018; 29863955). In one study of 55 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, KRAS mutations, especially in combination with TP53 alterations, correlated with improved clinical outcomes to PD_1 inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab, likely as a consequence of association with some immunogenic features such as tumor mutation burden (Dong et al., 2016; 28039262). Preclinical evidence suggests that KRAS activation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, such as trametinib, binimetinib, cobimetinib, and selumetinib (Nakano et al., 1984; 6320174, Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Yamaguchi et al., 2011; 21523318, Watanabe et al., 2013; 23438367, Gilmartin et al., 2011; 21245089, Yeh et al., 2009; 19372556). In a Phase 1 study evaluating the MEK_pan_RAF dual inhibitor CH5126766, 6 patients harboring KRAS mutations experienced PRs, including 3 with non_small cell lung cancer (NCSLC), 1 with low_grade serous ovarian carcinoma (LGSOC), 1 with endometrial adenocarcinoma, and 1 with multiple myeloma (Guo et al., 2020; 33128873). Combination of CH5126766 with the FAK inhibitor defactinib elicited PR rates of 50% (4/8) for patients with KRAS_mutated low_grade serous ovarian cancer and 12% (2/17) for patients with KRAS_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a Phase 1 study (Krebs et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT019, Shinde et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT143). Preclinical and clinical data suggest that KRAS mutations may predict clinical benefit from SHP2 inhibitors (Lu et al., 2019; 31068384, Mainardi et al., 2018; 29808006, Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001, Brana et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3005, Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). A Phase 1 study of RMC_4630 for relapsed/refractory solid tumors reported a DCR of 58% (23/40) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS mutations and a DCR of 75% (12/16) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS G12C mutations (Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001). Interim results from a Phase 1/2 study of RMC_4630 plus cobimetinib reported tumor reduction in 3 of 8 patients with KRAS_mutated colorectal cancer (Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). Combination approaches of MEK inhibitors with chemotherapy have been investigated in KRAS_mutated NSCLC (Gadgeel et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9021, Janne et al., 2017; 28492898, Gandara et al., 2017; 27876675); a Phase 3 study reported that addition of selumetinib to docetaxel did not improve PFS or OS for patients with KRAS_mutated NSCLC compared with docetaxel alone (Janne et al., 2017; 28492898). Multiple clinical studies have reported either low response rates or response rates similar to those of chemotherapy in patients with KRAS_mutated NSCLC receiving MEK inhibitors as a monotherapy (Blumenschein et al., 2015; 25722381, Leijen et al., 2012; 22767668, Zimmer et al., 2014; 24947927). Combinatorial approaches involving MEK inhibitors and other targeted therapies, including PI3K or EGFR inhibitors, have generally had limited clinical efficacy for patients with NSCLC and have been associated with high toxicity (van Geel et al., 2020; 32147669, Carter et al., 2016; 26802155, Bedard et al., 2014; 25500057, Tolcher et al., 2014; 25344362). Preclinical data suggest that KRAS mutation may confer sensitivity to SOS1 inhibitors (Hillig et al., 2019; 30683722, Hofmann et al., 2021; 32816843, Gerlach et al., 2020; AACR Abstract 1091). Phase 1 studies of the SOS1 inhibitor BI 1701963 alone or in combination with MEK inhibitors, KRAS G12C inhibitors, or irinotecan are recruiting for patients with solid tumors harboring KRAS mutations (Hofmann et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT210, Gort et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract TPS3651). Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been associated with benefit for patients with KRAS_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Phase 3 studies of nivolumab (Borghaie et al., 2015; 26412456) or atezolizumab (Rittmeyer et al., 2017; 27979383) versus docetaxel in NSCLC post_platinum doublet therapy reported benefit for their respective KRAS_mutated subcohorts in addition to the cohorts overall; KRAS mutations in NSCLC are reported to correlate with PD_(L)1 status (Liu et al., 2020; 31644929). A retrospective analysis of pooled data from 12 clinical trials investigating ICI with or without chemotherapy for patients with NSCLC reported that patients with KRAS_mutated NSCLC, including KRAS G12C, benefited from first_line chemotherapy plus ICI similar to those with KRAS_wildtype NSCLC (median OS [mOS] of 22.4 vs. 18.7 months, ORR of 46% vs. 51%); the ICI plus chemotherapy combination exhibited improved outcomes compared with ICI alone or chemotherapy alone (mOS of 22.4 vs. 16.2 vs. 17.1 months)(Nakajima et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 9001). CDK4/6 inhibitors have been investigated in KRAS_mutated NSCLC; in a Phase 3 study of third_line platinum_refractory NSCLC, abemaciclib failed to improve mOS (7.4 months vs. 7.8 months, HR=0.97) relative to erlotinib in KRAS_mutated disease, despite increased ORR and PFS rates (Goldman et al., 2020; 33194700). A Phase 1 combination trial of the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib with MEK inhibitor mirdametinib included 17 patients with KRAS_mutated NSCLC and reported 1 PR, >50% SD, and 5 patients with PFS >6 months; clinical benefit was seen among patients with tumors harboring KRAS mutation alone or together with inactivation of TP53 or CDKN2A/B, but not among patients with tumors harboring KRAS mutation and STK11 inactivation (Shapiro et al., 2017; AACR Abstract CT046). Although some studies have suggested that KRAS mutation status may predict a lack of response to the EGFR inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib for patients with lung cancer (Mao et al., 2010; 20022659, Pao et al., 2005; 15696205, Ludovini et al., 2011; 21258250), a retrospective study reported no statistically significant difference in response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors among KRAS_wildtype and KRAS_mutated disease independent from EGFR mutation status (Sun et al., 2013; 23724098). Co_occurring KRAS and STK11 alterations are associated with poorer response to ICIs for patients with NSCLC. Following anti_PD_1_based regimens, retrospective analyses have reported shorter OS for patients with KRAS_ and STK11_mutated tumors than for those whose KRAS_mutated tumors were STK11_wildtype (6.4 vs. 16.1 months, HR=1.99), as well as markedly fewer objective responses for patients with KRAS_ and STK11_mutated versus KRAS_ and TP53_mutated tumors in the CheckMate_057 (0% [0/6] vs. 57% [4/7]) (Skoulidis et al., 2018; 29773717) and GEMINI (0% [0/6] vs. 53% [9/17]) (Skoulidis et al., 2017; IASLC WCLC Abstract MA04.07) studies. Another study observed that patients with NSCLC and KRAS_mutated tumors without STK11 alteration who were treated with second_line immunotherapy experienced similar median PFS (2.8 vs. 2.2 months, HR=1.64) and numerically longer median OS (7.7 vs. 3.5 months, HR=2.3; p=0.09) compared with patients harboring mutations in both KRAS and STK11 (Marmarelis et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_64).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "KRAS activating mutations or amplification may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of MAPK pathway components, including MEK inhibitors. Limited clinical and preclinical studies indicate KRAS mutations may predict sensitivity to MEK_pan_RAF dual inhibitors.

The CDK8 protein regulates gene expression as part of the Mediator complex, and its overexpression can dysregulate various cancer pathways, including the WNT/beta_catenin and NOTCH pathways (Galbraith et al., 2010; 21327159, Rzymski et al., 2015; 26006748). CDK8 acts as oncogene in colon cancer and melanoma (Firestein et al., 2008; 18794900, Morris et al., 2008; 18794899, Adler et al., 2012; 22345154, Kapoor et al., 2010; 22345154) but has also been described to have tumor suppressor functions (McCleland et al, 2015; 26235356, Li et al., 2014; 25344755, Gu et al., 2013; 23454913). Whereas CDK8 mutations have not been extensively characterized, amplification or overexpression of CDK8, often as a result of copy number increases in chromosomal region 13q12.13, have been reported in the scientific literature and may be associated with shorter survival for patients with colon cancer (Firestein et al., 2010; 19790197, Firestein et al., 2008; 18794900, Xu and Ji, 2011; 22035865). CDK8 amplification has been identified in various solid tumor types, including colorectal adenocarcinoma (3%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (3%)(cBio_Witkiewicz et al., 2015; 25855536), stomach adenocarcinoma (less than 2%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317), prostate adenocarcinoma (0_6%)(cBio_Barbieri et al., 2012; 22610119, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26544944, cBio_Kumar et al., 2016; 26928463), and breast carcinoma (1_2%)(cBio_Ciriello et al., 2015; 26451490, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 23000897). In the TCGA datasets, CDK8 mutation was observed most frequently (2%) in bladder urothelial carcinoma (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 24476821), lung adenocarcinoma (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552), and lung squamous cell carcinoma (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745). In colorectal cancer, CDK8 expression has been detected in 70% of cases and correlated with beta_catenin activation; patients with CDK8_positive colon cancer experienced significantly shorter survival (hazard ratio of 2.05 by multivariate analysis), which was not seen for patients with rectal cancer (Firestein et al., 2010; 19790197, Seo et al., 2010; 20514474, He et al., 2011; 22104393). The association of CDK8 alterations with the prognosis of other tumor types has not been firmly established (Porter et al., 2012; 22869755, Kim et al., 2011; 21344156). There are no targeted therapies approved or in clinical trials that directly address genomic alterations in CDK8. Investigational inhibitors that selectively target CDK8 and the related CDK19 have shown activity against WNT_dependent tumors in preclinical assays (Dale et al., 2015; 26502155, Mallinger et al., 2016; 27326329, Koehler et al., 2016; 26985305, Schiemann et al., 2016; 26852363).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "FLT3", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "true", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "FLT3 encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that potentiates signaling through the RAS and PI3K pathways (Zhang et al., 1999; 10080542, Mizuki et al., 2000; 11090077, Chen et al., 2010; 21067588). FLT3 has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210) and may be biologically relevant in this context (Zack et al., 2013; 24071852, Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920).

Therapies targeting FLT3 are under clinical investigation, including crenolanib, gilteritinib, luxeptinib, midostaurin, pacritinib, pexidartinib, ponatinib, quizartinib, sorafenib, and sunitinib. The TKIs midostaurin (Stone et al., 2015; ASH Abstract 6, ASCO Abstract 6589, Perl et al., 2018; ASH Abstract 4038, Cooper et al., 2015; 25776192, Williams et al., 2016; 23798029, Heidel et al., 2006; 16150941, Stone et al., 2005; 15345597, Nazha et al., 2012; ASH Abstract 3587) and gilteritinib (Perl et al., 2019; 31665578, Pratz et al., 2018; ASH Abstract 564, Altman et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 7003, Perl et al., 2017; 28645776, Usuki et al., 2018; 30039554) have shown significant clinical activity for patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) harboring FLT3_ITD or FLT3_TKD mutations. In the Phase 1 study for the FLT3/BTK inhibitor luxeptinib, a patient with FLT3_ITD AML experienced a minimal residual disease (MRD)_negative CR (Goldberg, et al., 2021; ASH Abstract 1272). A patient with FLT3_amplified and KRAS_mutated colorectal cancer (CRC) achieved significant benefit from sorafenib treatment (Moreira et al., 2015; 25848357). Similarly, another patient with FLT3_amplified and KRAS_mutated CRC achieved a PR to regorafenib; two other patients with FLT3_amplified CRC treated with regorafenib experienced SD and PD, respectively (Lim et al., 2017; 27906677). However, a Phase 2 clinical trial of 10 patients with metastatic CRC and FLT3 amplification treated with sunitinib did not show significant clinical benefit (Alvarez et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT146/12).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "JAK1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "V310I", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "V310I"}}, "Interpretation": "The JAK1 (Janus kinase 1) gene encodes a tyrosine kinase that regulates signals triggered by cytokines and growth factors (Jatiani et al., 2010; 21442038). Dysregulation of JAK_STAT signaling has been implicated in a variety of epithelial tumors (Levine, 2012; 21823028). However, JAK_STAT signaling is required for the antiviral and antiproliferative effects of interferons (Pansky et al., 2000; 10699955). Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. In the lung adenocarcinoma TCGA and COSMIC datasets, JAK1 mutations have been reported in 1.6_3.0% of cases analyzed (Sep 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878, Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of JAK1 alterations in NSCLC are limited (PubMed, May 2022). In one study expression of p_JAK1 in NSCLC tumors has been significantly correlated with reduced patient survival (Liu et al., 2017; 28989534). Inhibitors of the JAK_STAT pathway are under development. The JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib is approved to treat myelofibrosis, and has shown efficacy in reducing symptoms in Phase 1 and 2 trials in patients with myeloproliferative disorders (Verstovsek et al., 2013; 23480528, Naqvi et al., 2011; 21635221, Verstovsek et al., 2012; 22718840). Other small molecule inhibitors of JAK1 are being investigated in preclinical studies in some types of solid tumors (Swiatek_Machado et al., 2012; 22555804, Yan et al., 2013; 23531921). HSP90 inhibitors are also being investigated in preclinical studies to target components of the JAK_STAT pathway such as JAK1 (Wang et al., 2010; 21154128). It is not known whether these therapeutic approaches would be relevant in the context of alterations that have not been fully characterized, as seen here.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI_H is generally infrequent in NSCLC, reported in fewer than 1% of samples across several large studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197, Ninomiya et al., 2006; 16641899, Vanderwalde et al., 2018; 29436178, Zang et al., 2019; 31270941, Dudley et al., 2016; 26880610, Takamochi et al., 2017; 28676214, Schrock et al., 2017; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2016.11.487), whereas data on the reported incidence of MSI_H in SCLC has been limited and conflicting (Pylkkanen et al., 1997; 9329646, Gonzalez et al., 2000; 11061602, Chen et al., 1996; 8782463, Merlo et al., 1994; 8174113). One study reported MSI_H in lung adenocarcinoma patients with smoking history, and 3 of 4 MSI_H patients examined also had metachronous carcinomas in other organs, although this has not been investigated in large scale studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of MSI in NSCLC are limited (PubMed, Oct 2021). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "SMAD2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "loss exons 3_11", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "loss exons 3_11"}}, "Interpretation": "SMAD2 encodes an intracellular transducer that is activated by TGF_beta or activin to dimerize with SMAD4 and regulate transcription of TGF_beta or activin_activated genes (Lebrun et al., 1999; 9892009, Lin et al., 2006; 16751101). SMAD2 alterations that disrupt the MH1 domain (amino acids 10_176), MH2 domain (amino acids 274_467), or critical phosphorylation sites are predicted to result in a loss of function (Fleming et al., 2013; 23139211, Funaba et al., 2002; 12193595, Mac\u00edas_Silva et al., 1996; 8980228, Massague et al., 2005; 16322555, Matsuzaki et al., 2009; 19531654, Wu et al., 2012; 22539990).

SMAD2 deletion, as well as loss of expression or phosphorylation (p_SMAD2), has been reported in several cancers (Boulay et al., 2001; 11391794, Xie et al., 2003; 12967141, Koumoundourou et al., 2007; 17695423, Xie et al., 2002; 11809701, Liapis et al., 2007; 17295676, Wu et al., 2007; 17729405, Mac\u00edas_Silva et al., 1996; 8980228) and has been correlated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular, gastric, breast, and colorectal cancer (Xie et al., 2003; 12967141, Koumoundourou et al., 2007; 17695423, Xie et al., 2002; 11809701, Liapis et al., 2007; 17295676, Wu et al., 2007; 17729405) but good prognosis in HNSCC (Xie et al., 2013; 22275186, Mangone et al., 2010; 20462450). There are no therapies that target the loss of SMAD2 or loss of TGF_beta signaling in cancer. Because TGF_beta can exert both tumor suppressor as well as pro_tumor effects, the development of therapies aimed at this pathway must be carefully considered for each patient. In preclinical studies, several novel small_molecule TGF_beta pathway inhibitors have been shown to reduce SMAD2 phosphorylation and tumor invasion in breast cancer cells and to increase survival in mouse xenograft models (Ehata et al., 2007; 17129361, Rausch et al., 2009; 19528470).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "V157D", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "V157D"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 is one of the most commonly mutated genes in lung cancer; mutations have been reported in 43_80% of non_small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745, Mogi and Kuwano, 2011; 21331359, Tekpli et al., 2013; 23011884, Vignot et al., 2013; 23630207, Maeng et al., 2013; 24222160, Cortot et al., 2014; 24169260, Itakura et al., 2013; 23922113), including 42_52% of lung adenocarcinomas and 58_83% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (cBioPortal, COSMIC, Feb 2022)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, cBio_Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745, Kim et al., 2014; 24323028). TP53 homozygous deletion has been observed in 1.4% of lung adenocarcinoma and <1% of lung squamous cell carcinoma cases (cBioPortal, Feb 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). In one study of 55 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, TP53 alterations correlated with immunogenic features including PD_L1 expression, tumor mutation burden and neoantigen presentation; likely as a consequence of this association TP53 mutations correlated with improved clinical outcomes to PD_1 inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab in this study (Dong et al., 2016; 28039262). Mutations in TP53 have been associated with lymph node metastasis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (Seo et al., 2012; 22975805). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may also be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as APR_246 (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571, Lehmann et al., 2012; 22965953, Mohell et al., 2015; 26086967, Franssonet al., 2016; 27179933). In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, APR_246 combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "01", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "01"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Spigel et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9017, Hellmann et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT077, Ramalingam et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT078, Kowanetz et al., 2016; ESMO Abstract 77P, Gandara et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 12950, Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Velcheti et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12001, Herbst et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA79, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT07, Castellanos et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 2630, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Colli et al., 2016; 27197178, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Wang et al., 2017; 28923100, Carbone et al., 2017; 28636851, Rizvi et al., 2018; 29337640, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Forde et al., 2018; 29658848, Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Miao et al., 2018; 30150660, Chae et al., 2019; 30425022, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526). A large_scale genomic analysis found that unspecified lung non_small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), lung adenocarcinoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) samples harbored median TMBs between 6.3 and 9 Muts/Mb, and 12% to 17% of cases had an elevated TMB of greater than 20 Muts/Mb (FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). Lower TMB is observed more commonly in NSCLCs harboring known driver mutations (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, or MET) with the exception of BRAF or KRAS mutations, which are commonly observed in elevated TMB cases (Spigel et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9017). Although some studies have reported a lack of association between smoking and mutational burden in NSCLC (Schwartz et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 8533, Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843, Shim et al., 2015; 26200269), several other large studies did find a strong association with increased TMB (Govindan et al., 2012; 22980976, Ding et al., 2008; 18948947, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Kim et al., 2014; 24323028). TMB >10 muts/Mb was found to be more frequent in NSCLC metastases compared with primary tumors for both adenocarcinoma (38% vs. 25%) and SCC (41% vs. 35%) subtypes (Stein et al., 2019; DOI: 10.1200/PO.18.00376). A meta_analysis of 19 studies of immune checkpoint inhibitor_treated NSCLC (n = 2,315 patients) demonstrated that high TMB predicted a significantly longer OS than low TMB (HR = 0.70), and within the high TMB group, immunotherapy was associated with an improved PFS (HR = 0.62, P<0.001), OS (HR = 0.67, P<0.001) and a higher response rate (OR = 2.35, P<0.001) compared to chemotherapy (Meng et al., 2022; 35113949). In contrast, a large study of Chinese patients with untreated lung adenocarcinoma reported a shorter median OS for tumors with a higher number of mutations in a limited gene set compared with a lower mutation number (48.4 vs. 61.0 months)(Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843). Another study of patients with NSCLC treated with EGFR inhibitors or platinum doublet chemotherapy found elevated TMB to be correlated with poorer prognosis, as well as finding lower TMB in combination with PD_L1 negative status to be significantly associated with longer median survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). However, no significant prognostic association of TMB and/or PD_L1 status with survival has been reported in patients with lung SCC (Yu et al., 2019; 30253973, Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). Multiple clinical trials of PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors or combination of PD_1 and CTLA_4 inhibitors in NSCLC have reported that patients with tumors harboring TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb derive greater clinical benefit from these therapies than those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb (based on this assay or others); similarly, higher efficacy of anti_PD_1 or anti_PD_L1 immunotherapy for treatment of patients with NSCLC, compared with the use of chemotherapy, has been observed more significantly in cases of TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (based on this assay or others); (Spigel et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9017, Hellmann et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT077, Ramalingam et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT078, Kowanetz et al., 2016; ESMO Abstract 77P, Gandara et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 12950, Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Velcheti et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12001, Herbst et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA79, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT07, Castellanos et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 2630, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Colli et al., 2016; 27197178, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Wang et al., 2017; 28923100, Carbone et al., 2017; 28636851, Rizvi et al., 2018; 29337640, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Forde et al., 2018; 29658848, Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Miao et al., 2018; 30150660, Chae et al., 2019; 30425022). Improved OS of patients with NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy relative to chemotherapy only (Paz_Ares et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA80), or those treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab also relative to chemotherapy (Hellmann et al., 2019;
