Although PD_L1 is a costimulatory molecule for naive T_cells, it can provide inhibitory signals to activated T_cells through interactions with the receptors PD_1 or CD80 (Keir et al., 2008; 18173375, Butte et al., 2007; 17629517). These signals can help PD_L1_expressing tumor cells evade immune detection by natural killer cells or T_cells (Benson et al., 2010; 20460501, Iwai et al., 2002; 12218188, Liu et al., 2007; 17363736). CD274 amplification is associated with positive PD_L1 protein expression in solid tumors (Huang et al., 2021; 32884129, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317, George et al., 2017; 27620277) and lymphomas (Ansell et al., 2015; 25482239, Green et al., 2010; 20628145). CD274 amplification has been identified in 2.1_23% of cervical cancer cases (Huang et al., 2021; 32884129, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2017; 28112728, Howitt et al., 2016; 26913631). CD274 amplification was reported to correlate with increased PD_L1 protein expression in cervical SCC (Howitt et al., 2016; 26913631). PD_L1 expression has been variously detected in 19_96% of cervical cancers (Karim et al., 2009; 19825956, Reddy et al., 2017; 28623908, Enwere et al., 2017; 28059093, Heeren et al., 2016; 27056074, Mezache et al., 2015; 26403783). In one study, PD_L1 expression was detected in 37.8% (28/74) of cervical SCC, 28.6% (2/7) of adenosquamous carcinomas and 16.7% (2/12) endocervical adenocarcinomas; none of the 6 benign cervical tissue samples were PD_L1_positive (Reddy et al., 2017; 28623908). Elevated PD_L1 expression has also been reported in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) (Zhang et al., 2015; 26624896, Mezache et al., 2015; 26403783). The prognostic impact of CD274 amplification has not been extensively studied in the context of cervical cancer (PubMed, Jan 2023). Influence of PD_L1 expression on prognosis of patients with cervical cancer is unclear, with one study reporting increased PD_L1 expression in high_grade vs. low_grade cervical SCC cases (Ma et al., 2017; 28270295), another study reporting no impact of PD_L1 expression on PFS or OS, but a trend for an inferior PFS in patients with PD_L1_positive, CD8 T cell_negative tumors (HR=0.43, P=0.053)(Enwere et al., 2017; 28059093) and a third study observing no impact of PD_L1 expression on patient survival (Karim et al., 2009; 19825956). Another study reported poorer survival in patients with cervical SCC with diffuse, compared with marginal, PD_L1 expression and poorer survival in patients with cervical adenocarcinoma with, versus without, PD_L1_positive macrophages (Heeren et al., 2016; 27056074). On the basis of strong clinical evidence, CD274 amplification and PD_L1 overexpression may predict sensitivity to antibodies targeting PD_L1 or PD_1. Patients with high tumor PD_L1 expression across multiple solid tumor types have exhibited improved clinical benefit with the PD_L1 antibodies atezolizumab (Martin_Liberal et al., 2015; ESMO Symposium on Immuno_Oncology Abstract 24P, Fehrenbacher et al., 2016; 26970723, Herbst et al., 2014; 25428504), toripalimab (Jiang et al., 2021; EMSO Abstract 1310P, Tang et al., 2020; 32321714, Tang et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract e21522, Xu et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 4021, Wang et al., 2019; 31236579, Xu et al., 2021; 33345750, Yonglong et al., 2021; 34678907, Xu et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract LBA2, Mai et al., 2021; 34341578, Wang et al., 2021; 33492986, Sheng et al., 2021; 34740921), and durvalumab (Powles et al., 2017; ASCO Genitourinary Abstract 286, Massard et al., 2016; 27269937, Bais et al., 2017; AACR Abstract 3720/5, Garassino et al., 2016; IASLC Abstract PLO4a.03, Segal et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 3011, Rebelatto et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 8033). The PD_1 antibodies pembrolizumab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), and tislelizumab have elicited significant clinical responses for patients with solid tumors (Kefford et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 3005, Groschel et al., 2016; 27900363, Hellman et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 3001, Sharma et al., 2020; 3291612, Wolchok et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 9505, Motzer et al., 2018; 29562145, Escudier et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract LBA5, Shen et al., 2022; 35442766) and for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, a tumor type that harbors frequent PD_L1 copy number gains (Ansell et al., 2015; ASH Abstract 583, Ansell et al., 2015; 25482239). However, studies evaluating nivolumab for patients with urothelial carcinoma or tislelizumab plus sitravatinib for patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have shown no correlation between clinical benefit and PD_L1 expression levels (Sharma et al., 2018; AACR abstract CT178, Qing et al., 2022; ESMO TAT abstract 2P). A Phase 1 trial evaluating bintrafusp alfa, a fusion protein targeting TGF_beta and PD_L1, reported ORRs of 37% (10/27) and 86% (6/7) for patients with NSCLC characterized as PD_L1_positive or having high PD_L1 expression, respectively (Paz_Ares et al., 2020; 32173464). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that JAK2 amplification regulates PD_L1 expression (Green et al., 2010; 20628145, Derenzini et al., 2011; 22829094); therefore, JAK2 inhibitors such as ruxolitinib may also be relevant for patients with PD_L1 amplification. A Phase 2 trial of the anti_PD_1 antibody sintilimab plus anlotinib as a second_line or later therapy for patients with advanced PD_L1_positive cervical cancer observed an ORR of 59% (23/39) and median PFS of 9.4 months (Xu et al., 2022; 35192397).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "CD274 (PD_L1) amplification or rearrangements that disrupt the 3  UTR may promote PD_1 signaling and inhibit the antitumor immune response.

Amplification of PDCD1LG2 and the adjacent locus CD274, encoding PD_L1, has been reported in 29% of primary mediastinal B_cell lymphoma (PMBCL) cases, and PDCD1LG2 copy number gain has been reported to correlate with increased PD_L2 protein expression as determined by immunohistochemistry (Twa et al., 2014; 24497532, Shi et al., 2014; 25025450).

Furthermore, PD_L1 expression correlated positively with expression of PD_1 (on lymphocytes) and PD_L2, as well as with objective response to the anti_PD_1 antibody nivolumab in various advanced solid tumors (Taube et al., 2014; 24714771). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> In the Phase 3 placebo_controlled KEYNOTE_826 study for recurrent or metastatic (R/M) cervical cancer, addition of pembrolizumab to frontline platinum_based chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab significantly improved the median PFS (10.4 vs. 8.2 months, HR=0.65) and 24_month OS rates (50.4% vs. 40.4%, HR=0.67); benefit from pembrolizumab was seen in patients with PD_L1_positive tumors (either CPS \u2265 1 or CPS \u2265 10) and in patients with or without concomitant bevacizumab (Colombo et al., 2021; 34534429). For patients with previously treated R/M cervical cancer in the Phase 2 KEYNOTE_158 study, single_agent pembrolizumab elicited an ORR of 14.3% and a DCR of 30.6% (5 CRs, 9 PRs, 16 SDs), a median PFS of 2.1 months, and a median OS of 9.3 months; objective responses were observed only in PD_L1_positive (CPS \u2265 1) patients (Chung et al., 2021; SGO Abstract 41, Chung et al., 2019; 30943124). Similar results were observed in an earlier phase study (Frenel et al., 2017; 29095678) and a retrospective case series (Kranawetter et al., 2018; 29787422). Combination of pembrolizumab with the TF_targeting antibody_drug conjugate tisotumab vedotin elicited an ORR of 38% (2 CRs, 11 PRs) and a median PFS of 5.6 months for patients with previously treated R/M cervical cancer in the Phase 1b/2 ENGOT_Cx8 study (Vergote et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 723MO). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Durvalumab", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Durvalumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to PD_L1 and blocks its interaction with PD_1 to enhance antitumor immune responses.

Amplification of PDCD1LG2, which is often co_amplified with CD274, may lead to PD_L2 overexpression and predict sensitivity to PD_L1_blocking antibodies such as durvalumab. Although durvalumab does not block the interaction between PD_L2 and PD_1, clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types suggests that PD_L2 expression may correlate with improved overall survival and response to the similar PD_L1_blocking antibody atezolizumab (Schmid et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 11506)(Herbst et al., 2015; 25680375, Fehrenbacher et al., 2016; 26970723). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> Clinical data on the efficacy of durvalumab for the treatment of cervical cancer are limited (PubMed, Oct 2022).

Single_agent durvalumab has demonstrated efficacy in non_small cell lung cancer (Bais et al., 2017; AACR Abstract 3720/5, Garassino et al., 2016; IASLC Abstract PLO4a.03), and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (Segal et al., 2016; ESMO Abstract 949O, Segal et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 3011). In patients with advanced solid tumors, durvalumab monotherapy has elicited disease control rates (DCRs) of 36.8\u201346.2% (7/19 to 12/26) in Phase 1/2 studies (Lutzky et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 3001, Iguchi et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 3039). Durvalumab is also under investigation in combination with other agents in Phase 1/2 trials. In advanced melanoma, durvalumab in combination with trametinib and dabrafenib elicited ORRs and DCRs of 76.2% (16/21) and 100% (21/21) in patients with BRAF_mutant tumors, and durvalumab with trametinib elicited ORRs and DCRs of 21.4% (3/14) and 64.3% (9/14) in patients whose tumors were BRAF wild_type (Ribas et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 3003). Durvalumab in combination with the PARP inhibitor olaparib has shown activity in patients with metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer and progression on enzalutamide and/or abiraterone (Karzai et al., 2017; ASCO Genitourinary Abstract 162) and in patients with BRCA_wild_type breast or gynecological cancer (Lee et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3015). Durvalumab in combination with the anti_CTLA4 antibody tremelimumab, but not durvalumab as a single_agent, has shown activity in patients with previously treated advanced germ cell tumors (Necchi et al., 2019; 30243800).

Focal amplification of MCL1 has been reported in lung, breast, and other cancer types, and the survival of cells with MCL1 amplification is dependent on MCL1 expression (Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). In non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), MCL1 amplification was significantly associated with increased MCL1 mRNA expression (Yin et al., 2016; 27264345). Although several MCL1 phosphorylation site mutations have been characterized (Thomas et al., 2010; 20540941), cancer_associated MCL1 mutations have not been reported (PubMed, 2023). MCL1 amplification has been reported at the highest incidence in lung adenocarcinoma (16%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552), breast invasive carcinoma (15%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 23000897), hepatocellular carcinoma (15%), and bladder urothelial carcinoma (13%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 24476821) and at lower frequencies in other solid tumor types (cBioPortal, 2023)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). MCL1 mutations have been reported in fewer than 1% of solid and hematologic cancers (COSMIC, 2023)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). In patients with NSCLC, MCL1 amplification was significantly associated with shorter overall survival (hazard ratio 1.39) (Yin et al., 2016; 27264345); high MCL1 protein expression alone was not prognostic in NSCLC (Schmidt et al., 2014; 25036876, Borner et al., 1999; 10070896, Wesarg et al., 2007; 17688235), whereas overexpression of both MCL1 and MYC was linked with poor survival (Allen et al., 2011; 21406400). High MCL1 expression has also been associated with poor prognosis in ovarian (Shigemasa et al., 2002; 12036450, Baekelandt et al., 2000; 11078490) and colorectal (Lee et al., 2014; 25628923) cancers. The prognostic significance of MCL1 expression in breast cancer is not clear (Ding et al., 2007; 17495324, O Driscoll et al., 2004; 15152946). There are no approved therapies to target MCL1 amplification, but MCL1 inhibitors including AMG 176, AMG 397, AZD5991, and S64315 (MIK665) are in early clinical development (Hird and Tron, 2019; 30790641, Caenepeel et al., 2018; 30254093, Tron et al., 2018; 30559424, Ramsey et al., 2018; 30185627). Limited preclinical data suggest that MCL1 expression alone may not be predictive of sensitivity to MCL1 inhibitors, but BH3 profiling may be a better predictor of MCL1 dependence (Caenepeel et al., 2018; 30254093, Kotschy et al., 2016; 27760111, Koch et al., 2019; 30498064, Ramsey et al., 2018; 30185627). Clinical and preclinical data indicate that increased MCL1 expression may be associated with resistance to BCL2_targeted agents such as venetoclax, navitoclax, or ABT_737 (Bose et al., 2017; 28140720, Roberts et al., 2012; 2218437, Konopleva et al., 2016; 27520294, Kumar et al., 2017; 29018077, Lin et al., 2016; 27283158, Suryani et al., 2014; 25013123, van Delft et al., 2006; 17097561, Konopleva et al., 2006; 17097560). In one study, amplification of the genomic locus containing MCL1 was acquired upon disease progression in patients with multiple myeloma treated with venetoclax (Neri et al., 2019; ASH Abstract 572). Combined inhibition of MCL1 and BCL2 may be more effective (Ramsey et al., 2018; 30185627, Moujalled et al., 2019; 30214012, Caenepeel et al., 2018; 30254093, Tron et al., 2018; 30559424, Leverson et al., 2015; 25590800). Indirect approaches using therapeutic agents that reduce MCL1 expression are also being investigated (Xiang et al., 2018; 30425521). Preclinical studies demonstrate that investigational cyclin_dependent kinase inhibitors targeting CDK9, such as dinaciclib, alvocidib, and voruciclib, suppress gene transcription, reduce MCL1 expression levels, and synergize with BCL2 inhibitors to induce apoptosis (Chen et al., 2016; 27469405, Jane et al., 2016; 26585571, Li et al., 2015; 25882699, Booher et al., 2014; 25289887, Zhou et al., 2018; 29241222, Bogenberger et al., 2017; 29291023, Chen et al., 2012; 22693249, Dey et al., 2017; 29269870). Preclinical studies in multiple types of cancer cells have also shown that the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib indirectly downregulates MCL1 and cooperates with BCL2_targeting agents (Arai et al., 2018; 30021909, Kiprianova et al., 2015; 26297434, Ricci et al., 2007; 17613437, Meng et al., 2007; 17698840), and a heavily pretreated patient with metastatic triple_negative breast cancer (TNBC) and MCL1 gene amplification responded to sorafenib in combination with several other therapies (Ali et al., 2016; 27293397). Preclinical studies of patient_derived tumor cells suggest that increased MCL1 levels may confer resistance to antitubulin therapies such as paclitaxel (Wertz et al., 2011; 21368834), and MCL1 amplification was reported to be more frequent in patients with TNBC and primary resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Balko et al., 2014; 24356096).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "MYCL1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "MYCL1 encodes a protein that regulates transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Hirvonen et al., 1991; 1954386). MYCL1 overexpression has been correlated with MYCL1 amplification in ovarian cancer (Wu et al., 2003; 12707044) and Merkel cell carcinoma (Paulson et al., 2009; 19020549). MYCL1 amplification has been reported in a variety of cancer types, including Merkel cell carcinoma (9/23, 39%) (Paulson et al., 2009; 19020549), prostate cancer (35%) (Boutros et al., 2015; 26005866, Edwards et al., 2003; 14614009), ovarian carcinoma (16%) (Wu et al., 2003; 12707044), medulloblastoma (3_15%) (McCabe et al., 2006; 16783165, Northcott et al., 2012; 22832581), small cell lung cancer (3_8%) (Iwakawa et al., 2013; 23716474, Sos et al., 2012; 23035247), lung adenocarcinoma (7%) (Ninomiya et al., 2013; 23289484), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC, 3%) (Ishizuka et al., 2002; 12147242), cervical SCC (2%) (Mitra et al., 1994; 7905784), urothelial carcinoma (2%) (Habuchi et al., 1994; 8064891), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (5/8, 62.5%) (Hui et al., 2002; 11836556), as well as in a case of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)(Lefkowitch et al., 2015; 2667682).

MYCL1 is a microsatellite marker, and allelic loss is a negative prognostic factor in colorectal adenocarcinoma (Kambara et al., 2004; 15014029). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of MYCL1 has been reported in 50% of recurrent and 37% of non_recurrent non_small cell lung cancer (Baksh et al., 2003; 12527710), as well as in 29% of HCCs in one study (Sun et al., 2001; 11391530).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI has been reported at a lower frequency in cervical cancer than in endometrial cancer (Helland et al., 1997; 9052745). A non_zero level of MSI has been reported in 5_25% (n = 38_100) of cervical carcinoma cases (Rodriguez et al., 1998; 9990486, Ercoli et al., 2005; 15823117, Helland et al., 1997; 9052745, Baay et al., 2009; 19480245, Chung et al., 2001; 11134837, Nishimura et al., 2000; 11063644), and was not associated with HPV infection status (Rodriguez et al., 1998; 9990486, Nishimura et al., 2000; 11063644).

In cervical adenocarcinoma, MSI_L has been detected in 16% (6/37) and MSI_H in 11% (4/37) of cases (Miyai et al., 2004; 15262128). MSI positivity has been reported to be significantly more frequent in invasive cervical carcinoma over cervical carcinoma in situ (Nishimura et al., 2000; 11063644) and in cervical SCC over cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (Wong et al., 2003; 12798708). Although a few studies have reported MSI positivity in cervical SCC to correlate with advanced stage (Chung et al., 2001; 11586036) or poorer overall survival (Wong et al., 2003; 12798708), several others have reported no association between MSI status and clinicopathologic features and/or prognosis in cervical carcinoma, including SCC (Wong et al., 2003; 12798708, Baay et al., 2009; 19480245, Clarke et al., 2003; 14615820, Helland et al., 1997; 9052745, Chung et al., 2001; 11134837, Nishimura et al., 2000; 11063644). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "NOTCH2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "rearrangement exon 25", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "rearrangement exon 25"}}, "Interpretation": "NOTCH2 encodes a member of the NOTCH family of receptors, which play a role in cell fate determination and various developmental processes. Upon binding of membrane_bound ligands, NOTCH signaling involves gamma_secretase (GS) cleavage of the NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD), which subsequently forms part of a transcription factor complex that regulates downstream target genes (Penton et al., 2012; 22306179, Kopan and Ilagan, 2009; 19379690). Depending on cellular context, NOTCH2 can act as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene (Pancewicz and Nicot, 2011; 22128846, Sakata_Yanagimoto and Chiba, 2012; 22695918, Kiel et al., 2012; 22891276, Egloff and Grandis, 2012; 22773520, Wang et al., 2011; 22006338). NOTCH2 rearrangements and fusions that result in expression of the NOTCH2 intracellular domain (amino acids 1699_2471) without the transmembrane domain (amino acids 1678_1698) are predicted to result in GS_independent activation of NOTCH signaling (Robinson et al., 2011; 22101766). Similar rearrangements leading to the fusion of SEC22B exon 1 to NOTCH2 exons 27_34 have previously been reported in breast cancer (Robinson et al., 2011; 22101766) and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Crotty et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1016/j.ehpc.2020.200408) and have been shown to be GS_inhibitor insensitive (Robinson et al., 2011; 22101766). Such rearrangements, as observed here, are predicted to be activating. NOTCH2 rearrangement was not found in any of the 298 samples analyzed in the Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Endocervical Adenocarcinoma TCGA dataset (cBioPortal, Mar 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of NOTCH2 alteration in cervical cancer are limited (PubMed, Aug 2022). Several approaches for inhibiting NOTCH2 signaling have been developed, including neutralizing NOTCH antibodies such as tarextumab (OMP_59R5) (Yen et al., 2015; 25934888), which targets NOTCH2 and NOTCH3, and pan_NOTCH inhibitors, such as gamma_secretase inhibitors (GSI). In a Phase 2 study, the GSI AL101 (BMS_906024) elicited PR in 15% (6/39) and SD in 54% (21/39) of patients with metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma harboring NOTCH activating alterations (Ferrarotto et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 919MO).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), PRKCI amplification strongly correlates with PKCi protein overexpression (Yang et al., 2008; 17990328). PRKCI has been reported to be frequently amplified in lung SCC, ovarian cancer, and esophageal SCC (Yang et al., 2008; 17990328, Justilien et al., 2014; 24525231, Zhang et al., 2006; 16651413). PRKCI amplification and/or protein overexpression has been associated with inferior patient prognosis and/or adverse clinico_pathological features in esophageal SCC, cholangiocarcinoma, lung, breast, pancreatic, gastric, ovarian, and brain cancers (Yang et al., 2008; 17990328, Patel et al., 2008; 18211289, Regala et al., 2005; 15994303, Kojima et al., 2008; 18538170, Scotti et al., 2010; 20179210, Takagawa et al., 2010; 19774416, Zhang et al., 2006; 16651413, Li et al., 2008; 18234642). In preclinical studies, genetic inhibition of PKCi expression has been shown to have anti_tumorigenic effects in xenografted and/or cultured cells of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, non_small cell lung cancer, glioma, and pancreatic, ovarian, and colon carcinoma (Kikuchi et al., 2013; 22349825, Stallings_Mann et al., 2006; 16452237, Regalo et al., 2009; 19738040, Scotti et al., 2010; 20179210, Zhang et al., 2006; 16651413, Murray et al., 2004; 15024028, Patel et al., 2008; 18211289). In preclinical studies, the PKCi inhibitor aurothiomalate has been shown to have anti_tumorigenic effects in lung cancer and rhabdomyosarcoma cells (Regala et al., 2009; 19738040, Kikuchi et al., 2013; 22349825, Stallings_Mann et al., 2006; 16452237). A Phase 1 escalation trial of aurothiomalate in patients with advanced lung, ovarian, or pancreatic cancer reported 2/11 enrolled patients achieving stable disease (Mansfield et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 2551). Other PKCi inhibitors with improved PKCi selectivity, such as CRT0066854 and ICA_1, are in preclinical development (Desai et al., 2012; AACR Abstract 3760)(Kj\u00e6r et al., 2013; 23418854). In preclinical models, PKCi activation has been reported to promote hedgehog signaling (Justilien et al., 2014; 24525231) as well as RAS signaling and to require the RAC1_MEK_ERK pathway for tumorigenesis (Regala et al., 2005; 15994303, Scotti et al., 2010; 20179210, Murray et al., 2004; 15024028, Fields et al., 2007; 17956262). Therefore, MEK inhibitors may be beneficial for a patient with PRKCI amplification. MEK inhibitors are in clinical trials in multiple cancer types. The MEK inhibitors cobimetinib and trametinib are approved for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations and are being studied in clinical trials in multiple cancer types (Larkin et al., 2014; 25265494, Flaherty et al., 2012; 22663011).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "04", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "04"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB level associated with lower rates of clinical benefit from treatment with PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors compared with patients with tumors harboring higher TMB levels, based on several studies in multiple solid tumor types (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of unknown primary harbors a median tumor mutational burden (TMB) of 7.6 Muts/Mb, and 22% of cases have high TMB (>20 Muts/Mb) (FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). High TMB has been reported frequently in skin SCC (67% of cases) (FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421, Goodman et al., 2019; 31003990); in 10% of lung SCC (Goodman et al., 2019; 31003990); 8_13% of head and neck SCC cases and non_small cell lung carcinoma, including lung SCC cases (Spigel et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9017, FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421); and in additional SCC cases, including urothelial (12%), cervical (6.5%), anal (3.8%), and esophageal (2.1%) (Goodman et al., 2019; 31003990). One study reported that cervical carcinoma harbors a median tumor mutational burden (mTMB) of 4.4 Muts/Mb and a TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb in 15_21% of cases (Shao et al., 2020; 33119110, Huang et al., 2021; SGO Abstract 371). For cervical squamous cell carcinoma and cervical adenocarcinoma, studies reported an mTMB of 3.7_5.4 and 1.6_3.6 Muts/Mb, respectively, and a high TMB (>20 Muts/Mb) in 6.7% and 3.6% of cases, respectively (FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421, Ojesina et al., 2014; 24390348). For patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) treated with PD_L1/PD_1 inhibitors, a Kaplan_Meier analysis showed a significant association for patients with high tumor mutational burden (TMB) with longer time to treatment failure (9.9 vs. 4.4 months) (Goodman et al., 2019; 31003990). In the majority of cutaneous SCC cases, high mutational burden has been attributed to UV exposure rather than defective DNA mismatch repair or polymerase activity (South et al., 2014; 24662767, Pickering et al., 2014; 25303977), although one study reported a small number of cutaneous SCC cases (4/39) harboring a mutation signature similar to that of human papillomavirus_positive head and neck SCC (Pickering et al., 2014; 25303977). In patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TMB is similar between cases with squamous and non_squamous histology (Spigel et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9017), and increased TMB is associated with higher tumor grade and poor prognosis (Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843), as well as with a decreased frequency of known driver mutations in EGFR, ALK, ROS1, or MET (1% of high_TMB samples each) but not BRAF (10%) or KRAS (9.4%) (Spigel et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9017). Although some studies have reported a lack of association between smoking and increased TMB in NSCLC (Schwartz et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 8533, Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843, Shim et al., 2015; 26200269), several other large studies did find a strong prognostic association (Govindan et al., 2012; 22980976, Ding et al., 2008; 18948947, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Kim et al., 2014; 24323028). For patients with advanced cervical carcinoma not treated with immunotherapy, OS did not significantly differ between patients with TMB_high (\u226510 mut/Mb) and TMB_low (<10 Muts/Mb), although relatively few patients had TMB_high cervical carcinoma in this analysis (n=17) (Shao et al., 2020; 33119110). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, increased tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Ott et al., 2019; 30557521, Cristescu et al., 2022; 35101941, Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). In the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors, significant improvement in ORR was observed for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) compared with those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526); similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). At the same TMB cutpoint, retrospective analysis of patients with solid tumors treated with any checkpoint inhibitor identified that tissue TMB scores \u2265 10 Muts/Mb were associated with prolonged time to treatment failure compared with scores <10 muts/Mb (HR=0.68) (Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). For patients with solid tumors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the CheckMate 848 trial, improved responses were observed in patients with a tissue TMB \u2265 10 Muts/Mb independent of blood TMB at any cutpoint in matched samples (Schenker at al., 2022; AACR Abstract 7845). However, support for higher TMB thresholds and efficacy was observed in the prospective Phase 2 MyPathway trial of atezolizumab for patients with pan_solid tumors, where improved ORR and DCR was seen in patients with TMB \u2265 16 Muts/Mb than those with TMB \u2265 10 and <16 Muts/Mb (Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409). Similarly, analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "CD274 (PD_L1)", "Alteration": "amplification", "Title": "KAZ954 Alone and With PDR001, NZV930 and NIR178 in Advanced Solid Tumors", "StudyPhase": "PHASE null", "Target": "ADORA2A, CD73, PD_1", "Locations": "Taipei (Taiwan), Shatin, New Territories (Hong Kong), Sunto Gun (Japan), Singapore (Singapore), Milano (Italy), Barcelona (Spain), California, Illinois, Toronto (Canada), Missouri", "NCTID": "NCT04237649", "Note": "CD274 (PD_L1) amplification or rearrangements that disrupt the 3  UTR may promote PD_1 signaling and inhibit the antitumor immune response.
