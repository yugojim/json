{"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "ARAF encodes a member of the RAF family of serine_threonine kinases that includes BRAF and CRAF and activates the MEK_ERK signaling cascade. Like CRAF, alteration of ARAF in cancer is thought to be rare compared to BRAF due to the requirement of activating phosphorylation of its negative_charge regulatory region (Emuss et al., 2005; 16266992). ARAF overexpression and activating mutations have been reported to transform cultured cells and to hyperactivate the MEK_ERK MAPK pathway (Imielinski et al., 2014; 24569458). ARAF has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210) and may be biologically relevant in this context (Zack et al., 2013; 24071852, Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). ARAF mutations have been reported in 1_3% of non_small cell lung carcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, cBio_Ding et al., 2008; 18948947, cBio_Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745, cBio_Campbell et al., 2016; 27158780). ARAF mutations have been associated with response to sorafenib in lung adenocarcinoma (Imielinski et al., 2014; 24569458). In a study of lung adenocarcinoma samples from six smokers and six nonsmokers, hypomethylation of ARAF has been observed in smokers but not in nonsmokers (Tan et al., 2013; 24204162). ARAF has been reported to be one of nine proteins associated with promoting cell viability of EGFR_mutated lung cancer cell lines (Li et al., 2013; 24189400). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of ARAF alteration in lung cancer are limited (PubMed, Dec 2022). ARAF activating mutations may predict sensitivity to pan_RAF and MEK inhibitors. In a preclinical study, cell transformation and hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway as a result of ARAF activation was reportedly inhibited by the MEK inhibitor trametinib and the pan_RAF inhibitor sorafenib (Imielinski et al., 2014; 24569458). Furthermore, 1 patient with Stage 4 lung adenocarcinoma whose tumor harbored the activating ARAF mutation S214C experienced a near_complete response and 5_year PFS upon sorafenib treatment (Imielinski et al., 2014; 24569458).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "ARAF activating mutations may lead to increased RAF activity and subsequent activation of the MEK pathway and may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting these pathways.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT03337698", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04803318", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04985604", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03284502", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03905148", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03600701", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05159245", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04817956", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04551521", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "EGFR", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": [{"Name": "exon 19 deletion (S752_I759del)", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "48.37", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "exon 19 deletion (S752_I759del)"}}, "Interpretation": "EGFR encodes the epidermal growth factor receptor, which belongs to a class of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases. In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations, such as seen here, have been shown to activate the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR and to confer sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib, gefitinib (Lynch et al., 2004; 15118073, Paez et al., 2004; 15118125, Pao et al., 2004; 15329413), afatinib (Yang et al., 2015; 25589191), osimertinib (Soria et al., 2018; 29151359), and dacomitinib (Wu et al., 2017; 28958502, Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), although limited preclinical data suggest reduced sensitivity to lapatinib (Gilmer et al., 2008; 18199554, Foster et al., 2016; 26996308). Amplification of EGFR has been associated with increased expression of EGFR mRNA and protein in several cancer types (Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Bhargava et al., 2005; 15920544, Yang et al., 2012; 22490401). EGFR mutation has been reported in 12_36% of lung adenocarcinomas (Vallee et al., 2013; 23934203, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552) and in 4% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745). Amplification of EGFR has been variously reported in 4_42% of non_small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) samples (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745, Park et al., 2012; 22207554, Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Grob et al., 2013; 23238037). EGFR protein expression/overexpression has been reported in up to 70% of NSCLC cases (Watzka et al., 2010; 20353893, Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Grob et al., 2013; 23238037, Park et al., 2012; 22207554, Dobashi et al., 2011; 21040950, Ludovini et al., 2013; 23314677). In addition, expression of EGFR protein has been shown to be higher in lung squamous cell carcinoma samples as compared to lung adenocarcinoma (Skrzypski et al., 2013; 23870818, Kim et al., 2012; 22419022). In patients with lung adenocarcinoma, EGFR gene amplification was a predictor of poor disease_free survival (Lee et al., 2013; 23525704). EGFR mutations have been reported to predict improved survival for patients with resected Stage 1_3 lung adenocarcinoma (Marks et al., 2008; 18303429, Wu et al., 2014; ESMO Abstract 1175O, Yang et al., 2022; 34977823) or resected Stage 1 non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Izar et al., 2013; 23932319). For patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma who did not undergo surgery, presence of EGFR mutations was associated with significantly longer survival than EGFR wildtype status (p=0.001); multivariate analyses identified TKI treatment and exon 19 deletion was significantly associated with reduced mortality (HR=0.678, p=0.002), whereas TKI treatment and exon 21 mutation was associated with increased mortality (HR=1.365, p=0.015) (Yoon et al., 2020; 32053675). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EGFR activating mutations may predict sensitivity to EGFR\u2013TKIs, including erlotinib (Rosell et al., 2011; 22285168), gefitinib (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064, Hayashi et al., 2020; 32673682, Cao et al., 2018; 29780256, Yang et al., 2011; 21422421), afatinib (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960, Bao_Dong Qin et al., 2018; 30127622, Frega et al., 2016; 27131295, Long et al., 2020; 33116645), dacomitinib (Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), and osimertinib (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549, Bao_Dong Qin et al., 2018; 30127622); however, the data for patients with other tumor types are limited (Hong et al., 2020; 32749686, Kim et al., 2015; 26462025, Kim et al., 2015; 25424851, Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840, Cavalieri et al., 2018; 29734047, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Audet et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 6041). EGFR amplification or expression in patients with non_small cell lung cancer may be associated with benefit from the anti_EGFR antibodies cetuximab (Pirker et al., 2011; 22056021, Herbst et al., 2018; 29169877) or necitumumab (Paz_Ares et al., 2016; 27207107). Although meta_analyses demonstrate that increased EGFR copy number is significantly associated with improved ORR, PFS, and OS on first_generation EGFR TKIs (Zhang et al., 2016; 27664271, Dahabreh et al., 2011; 20826716, Dahabreh et al., 2010; 20028749, Carlson et al., 2009; 19430813), the magnitude of clinical benefit is limited for patients with EGFR amplification and without sensitizing EGFR mutations when comparing first_or second generation EGFR TKIs to control treatment (Fukuoka et al., 2011; 21670455, Cappuzzo et al., 2015; 25514804, Greve et al., 2015; 25682316, 25514804, Crino et al., 2008; 18779612, Kim et al., 2008; 19027483, Soh et al., 2007; 17487844). In the Phase 3 IPASS trial, patients with unmutated, amplified EGFR had a significantly shorter PFS when treated with gefitinib as compared to carboplatin/paclitaxel (HR 3.85; 95% CI, 2.09 to 7.09) (Fukuoka et al., 2011; 21670455). Biomarker analysis of the LUX_Lung 8 trial in squamous NSCLC, which included only a small subset of patients with EGFR mutations (6%), did not observe a significant association of EGFR expression with outcomes on afatinib or erlotinib (Goss et al., 2018; 29902295). A retrospective study in China reported that EGFR amplification was associated with a significantly improved median PFS (5.0 vs 2.0 months) and a similar median OS (16.6. vs. 15.4 months) for patients with unmutated EGFR treated with gefitinib or erlotinib (Wang et al., 2013; 23557218). A Phase 1 study of amivantamab monotherapy or amivantamab in combination with lazertinib for the treatment of EGFR_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has produced encouraging preliminary results for treatment_naive patients and patients who relapsed after treatment with osimertinib with and without chemotherapy, including osimertinib_relapsed patients with biomarkers indicating EGFR/MET_based osimertinib resistance (Park et al., 2021; 34339292, Jatkoe et al., 2022; 35963523, Petrini et al., 2022; 36246734, Bauml et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9006). A Phase 1/2 trial of MCLA_129, an EGFR/c_MET bispecific antibody, reported 1 PR in a patient with EGFR_mutated NSCLC who had received prior systemic treatment (Ou et al, 2022; DOI: DOI: 10.1016/S0959_8049(22)01124_8). For patients with EGFR exon 18_mutated pretreated NSCLC, the updated results from the SUMMIT basket trial of neratinib reported an ORR of 34% (10/29) and a median PFS of 5.8 months, including ORRs of 30% (7/23) for TKI_pretreated patients, 50% (3/6) for TKI_naive patients, and 29% (2/7) for those with brain metastases (Goldman et al., 2022; ENA Abstract 228). In a Phase 1 trial, the HER3_targeted antibody patritumab deruxtecan elicited an ORR of 39% (22/57, 1 CR) and a median PFS of 8.2 months for patients with non_small cell lung cancer previously treated with an EGFR TKI, many of whom displayed TKI resistance alterations (Janne et al., 2022; 34548309). A Phase 1 trial evaluating the EGFR inhibitor AZD3759 reported a reduction in the volume of brain metastases in 40% (8/20) of patients with previously treated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring either the EGFR L858R alteration or EGFR exon 19 deletion, including 3 confirmed PRs and 3 unconfirmed PRs (Ahn et al., 2017; 29056570, Yang et al., 2016; 27928026). In a Phase 1/2 trial for advanced NSCLC, the brain_penetrant third_generation EGFR TKI lazertinib enabled ORRs of 54% (69/127) for all evaluable patients and 44% (8/18, intracranial) for patients with brain metastases (Ahn et al., 2019; 31587882). A Phase 1 trial evaluating the irreversible pan_HER inhibitor FCN_411 for NSCLC patients who had EGFR mutations and experienced disease progression on standard treatments reported an ORR of 15% with 10/67 patients achieving PR, and a DCR of 73% with 39 additional patients achieving SD (Lin et al., 2022; 35248866). OR was observed in a numerically higher proportion of patients with the EGFR T790M mutation than those without this mutation (Lin et al., 2022; 35248866). A Phase 1 study showed that the MET antibody_drug conjugate telisotuzumab vedotin (teliso_V) plus osimertinib yielded an ORR of 58% (11/19) for patients with EGFR_mutated, MET_overexpressing NSCLC who progressed on osimertinib, including ORRs of 56% (5/9) for patients with EGFR L858R mutation and 67% (6/9) for those with EGFR exon 19 deletion and no response for a patient with EGFR G719S mutation (Goldman et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 9013). The Phase 3 AENEAS trial of first_line aumolertinib, a third_generation EGFR TKI, for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring either the EGFR L858R alteration or EGFR exon 19 deletion reported significantly improved mPFS (19.3 months vs. 9.9 months) and similar ORR (74% vs. 72%) and DCR (93% vs. 97%) compared with gefitinib (Lu et al., 2022; 35580297). Patients with EGFR_mutated non_squamous metastatic non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who progressed on EGFR TKI have benefited from immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with antiangiogenic therapy and chemotherapy, particularly atezolizumab plus bevacizumab plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (OS HR=0.61 compared with bevacizumab/chemotherapy) (Reck et al., 2019; 30922878, Socinski et al., 2021; 34311108, Socinski et al., 2018; 29863955) or sintilimab plus bevacizumab biosimilar IBI305 plus cisplatin and pemetrexed (PFS HR=0.46 compared with chemotherapy alone) (Lu et al., 2022; 35908558).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

Patients with untreated advanced NSCLC and EGFR exon 19 deletions achieved an ORR of 76% (Wu et al., 2017; 28958502) and a median OS of 34.1 months with dacomitinib (Mok et al., 2018; 29864379). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> A randomized Phase 3 trial for patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring activating EGFR mutations (primarily L858R or exon 19 deletions) reported improved clinical benefit with first_line dacomitinib compared with gefitinib (median OS [mOS] of 34.1 vs. 26.8 months, HR=0.760; median PFS [mPFS] of 14.7 vs. 9.2 months, HR=0.59) (Mok et al., 2018; 2986437, Wu et al., 2017; 28958502); mOS was 34.1 to 36.7 months and ORR was 75% to 79%, depending on the dosing regimen (Wu et al., 2018; WCLC abstract MA26.11). A pooled subgroup analysis for patients with NSCLC harboring activating EGFR mutations reported improved clinical efficacy with dacomitinib treatment compared with erlotinib (mPFS of 14.6 vs. 9.6 months, HR=0.717; mOS of 26.6 vs. 23.2 months, HR=0.737) (Ramalingam et al., 2016; 26768165). An analysis of dacomitinib in NSCLC comparing common activating EGFR alterations alone with co_occurring common and uncommon EGFR mutations showed no statistically significant difference in total ORR (33% vs. 40%, p=0.636) or DCR (77% vs. 73%, p=0.089); however, multivariate analysis revealed compound mutation status as an independent predictor of worse OS (HR=5.405) (Li et al., 2022; 35693621).

In the first_line setting for patients who are EGFR TKI naive with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring common EGFR mutations (exon 19 or L858R alterations), afatinib has shown improved clinical benefit and responses as compared with chemotherapy in the Phase 3 LUX_Lung 3 and LUX_Lung 6 trials (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960, Wu et al., 2014; 24439929) and to gefitinib in the Phase 2b LUX_Lung 7 trial (Park et al., 2016; 27083334, Paz_Ares et al., 2017; 28426106); these outcomes are supported in additional prospective or randomized Phase 2 trials (Popat et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.13_17, Suzuki et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_92). Alteration_specific differences in OS response have also been reported in patients who are treatment naive, with increased OS observed in patients with EGFR exon 19 alterations between afatinib and comparator arms versus no significant OS differences for patients with L858R mutations in the same treatment settings (Yang et al., 2015; 25589191, Lau et al., 2019; 31178389). In the second_line setting, patients with metastatic NSCLC and common EGFR mutations who progressed on prior chemotherapy experienced an ORR of 50% (30/60) from afatinib in a Phase 4 trial (Thongprasert et al., 2019; 31807143). A retrospective study of afatinib administered to Asian patients with NSCLC, 99% of whom were previously treated with erlotinib and/or gefitinib, reported an ORR of 27% for patients with common sensitizing EGFR mutations and an ORR of 24% for the entire cohort (Chang et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_11). In a case report, a patient with NSCLC with exon 19 deletion and leptomeningeal metastases experienced an ongoing 16_month PR from afatinib in extracranial, brain, and leptomeningeal lesions (Llinas_Quintero et al., 2019; 31637072). For patients with erlotinib_ or gefitinib_resistant NSCLC and EGFR mutations, Phase 2/3 studies of afatinib treatment have generally reported ORRs of only 7 to 9% (Miller et al., 2012; 22452896, Chen et al., 2013; 23664448, Katakami et al., 2013; 23816963, Landi et al., 2014; 25242668, De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2015; 25682316, Yang et al., 2015; 26051236); however, DCRs of more than 50% have been observed (De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2015; 25682316). In a Phase 1b or observational study, patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC who progressed on afatinib experienced further clinical benefit from subsequent treatment with afatinib and cetuximab (Horn et al., 2017; 29110849) or osimertinib (Yamamoto et al., 2020; 31863283), respectively.

In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations, such as seen here, have been shown to activate the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR and to confer sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib, gefitinib (Lynch et al., 2004; 15118073, Paez et al., 2004; 15118125, Pao et al., 2004; 15329413), afatinib (Yang et al., 2015; 25589191), osimertinib (Soria et al., 2018; 29151359), and dacomitinib (Wu et al., 2017; 28958502, Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), although limited preclinical data suggest reduced sensitivity to lapatinib (Gilmer et al., 2008; 18199554, Foster et al., 2016; 26996308).

EGFR mutations have been reported to predict improved survival for patients with resected Stage 1_3 lung adenocarcinoma (Marks et al., 2008; 18303429, Wu et al., 2014; ESMO Abstract 1175O, Yang et al., 2022; 34977823) or resected Stage 1 non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Izar et al., 2013; 23932319). For patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma who did not undergo surgery, presence of EGFR mutations was associated with significantly longer survival than EGFR wildtype status (p=0.001); multivariate analyses identified TKI treatment and exon 19 deletion was significantly associated with reduced mortality (HR=0.678, p=0.002), whereas TKI treatment and exon 21 mutation was associated with increased mortality (HR=1.365, p=0.015) (Yoon et al., 2020; 32053675). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EGFR activating mutations may predict sensitivity to EGFR\u2013TKIs, including erlotinib (Rosell et al., 2011; 22285168), gefitinib (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064, Hayashi et al., 2020; 32673682, Cao et al., 2018; 29780256, Yang et al., 2011; 21422421), afatinib (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960, Bao_Dong Qin et al., 2018; 30127622, Frega et al., 2016; 27131295, Long et al., 2020; 33116645), dacomitinib (Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), and osimertinib (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549, Bao_Dong Qin et al., 2018; 30127622); however, the data for patients with other tumor types are limited (Hong et al., 2020; 32749686, Kim et al., 2015; 26462025, Kim et al., 2015; 25424851, Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840, Cavalieri et al., 2018; 29734047, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Audet et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 6041). EGFR amplification or expression in patients with non_small cell lung cancer may be associated with benefit from the anti_EGFR antibodies cetuximab (Pirker et al., 2011; 22056021, Herbst et al., 2018; 29169877) or necitumumab (Paz_Ares et al., 2016; 27207107). Although meta_analyses demonstrate that increased EGFR copy number is significantly associated with improved ORR, PFS, and OS on first_generation EGFR TKIs (Zhang et al., 2016; 27664271, Dahabreh et al., 2011; 20826716, Dahabreh et al., 2010; 20028749, Carlson et al., 2009; 19430813), the magnitude of clinical benefit is limited for patients with EGFR amplification and without sensitizing EGFR mutations when comparing first_or second generation EGFR TKIs to control treatment (Fukuoka et al., 2011; 21670455, Cappuzzo et al., 2015; 25514804, Greve et al., 2015; 25682316, 25514804, Crino et al., 2008; 18779612, Kim et al., 2008; 19027483, Soh et al., 2007; 17487844). In the Phase 3 IPASS trial, patients with unmutated, amplified EGFR had a significantly shorter PFS when treated with gefitinib as compared to carboplatin/paclitaxel (HR 3.85; 95% CI, 2.09 to 7.09) (Fukuoka et al., 2011; 21670455). Biomarker analysis of the LUX_Lung 8 trial in squamous NSCLC, which included only a small subset of patients with EGFR mutations (6%), did not observe a significant association of EGFR expression with outcomes on afatinib or erlotinib (Goss et al., 2018; 29902295). A retrospective study in China reported that EGFR amplification was associated with a significantly improved median PFS (5.0 vs 2.0 months) and a similar median OS (16.6. vs. 15.4 months) for patients with unmutated EGFR treated with gefitinib or erlotinib (Wang et al., 2013; 23557218). A Phase 1 study of amivantamab monotherapy or amivantamab in combination with lazertinib for the treatment of EGFR_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has produced encouraging preliminary results for treatment_naive patients and patients who relapsed after treatment with osimertinib with and without chemotherapy, including osimertinib_relapsed patients with biomarkers indicating EGFR/MET_based osimertinib resistance (Park et al., 2021; 34339292, Jatkoe et al., 2022; 35963523, Petrini et al., 2022; 36246734, Bauml et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9006). A Phase 1/2 trial of MCLA_129, an EGFR/c_MET bispecific antibody, reported 1 PR in a patient with EGFR_mutated NSCLC who had received prior systemic treatment (Ou et al, 2022; DOI: DOI: 10.1016/S0959_8049(22)01124_8). For patients with EGFR exon 18_mutated pretreated NSCLC, the updated results from the SUMMIT basket trial of neratinib reported an ORR of 34% (10/29) and a median PFS of 5.8 months, including ORRs of 30% (7/23) for TKI_pretreated patients, 50% (3/6) for TKI_naive patients, and 29% (2/7) for those with brain metastases (Goldman et al., 2022; ENA Abstract 228). In a Phase 1 trial, the HER3_targeted antibody patritumab deruxtecan elicited an ORR of 39% (22/57, 1 CR) and a median PFS of 8.2 months for patients with non_small cell lung cancer previously treated with an EGFR TKI, many of whom displayed TKI resistance alterations (Janne et al., 2022; 34548309). A Phase 1 trial evaluating the EGFR inhibitor AZD3759 reported a reduction in the volume of brain metastases in 40% (8/20) of patients with previously treated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring either the EGFR L858R alteration or EGFR exon 19 deletion, including 3 confirmed PRs and 3 unconfirmed PRs (Ahn et al., 2017; 29056570, Yang et al., 2016; 27928026). In a Phase 1/2 trial for advanced NSCLC, the brain_penetrant third_generation EGFR TKI lazertinib enabled ORRs of 54% (69/127) for all evaluable patients and 44% (8/18, intracranial) for patients with brain metastases (Ahn et al., 2019; 31587882). A Phase 1 trial evaluating the irreversible pan_HER inhibitor FCN_411 for NSCLC patients who had EGFR mutations and experienced disease progression on standard treatments reported an ORR of 15% with 10/67 patients achieving PR, and a DCR of 73% with 39 additional patients achieving SD (Lin et al., 2022; 35248866). OR was observed in a numerically higher proportion of patients with the EGFR T790M mutation than those without this mutation (Lin et al., 2022; 35248866). A Phase 1 study showed that the MET antibody_drug conjugate telisotuzumab vedotin (teliso_V) plus osimertinib yielded an ORR of 58% (11/19) for patients with EGFR_mutated, MET_overexpressing NSCLC who progressed on osimertinib, including ORRs of 56% (5/9) for patients with EGFR L858R mutation and 67% (6/9) for those with EGFR exon 19 deletion and no response for a patient with EGFR G719S mutation (Goldman et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 9013). The Phase 3 AENEAS trial of first_line aumolertinib, a third_generation EGFR TKI, for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring either the EGFR L858R alteration or EGFR exon 19 deletion reported significantly improved mPFS (19.3 months vs. 9.9 months) and similar ORR (74% vs. 72%) and DCR (93% vs. 97%) compared with gefitinib (Lu et al., 2022; 35580297). Patients with EGFR_mutated non_squamous metastatic non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who progressed on EGFR TKI have benefited from immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with antiangiogenic therapy and chemotherapy, particularly atezolizumab plus bevacizumab plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (OS HR=0.61 compared with bevacizumab/chemotherapy) (Reck et al., 2019; 30922878, Socinski et al., 2021; 34311108, Socinski et al., 2018; 29863955) or sintilimab plus bevacizumab biosimilar IBI305 plus cisplatin and pemetrexed (PFS HR=0.46 compared with chemotherapy alone) (Lu et al., 2022; 35908558).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

A pooled subgroup analysis for patients with NSCLC harboring activating EGFR mutations reported improved clinical efficacy with dacomitinib treatment compared with erlotinib (mPFS of 14.6 vs. 9.6 months, HR=0.717; mOS of 26.6 vs. 23.2 months, HR=0.737) (Ramalingam et al., 2016; 26768165). An analysis of dacomitinib in NSCLC comparing common activating EGFR alterations alone with co_occurring common and uncommon EGFR mutations showed no statistically significant difference in total ORR (33% vs. 40%, p=0.636) or DCR (77% vs. 73%, p=0.089); however, multivariate analysis revealed compound mutation status as an independent predictor of worse OS (HR=5.405) (Li et al., 2022; 35693621).

Alteration_specific differences in OS response have also been reported in patients who are treatment naive, with increased OS observed in patients with EGFR exon 19 alterations between afatinib and comparator arms versus no significant OS differences for patients with L858R mutations in the same treatment settings (Yang et al., 2015; 25589191, Lau et al., 2019; 31178389). In the second_line setting, patients with metastatic NSCLC and common EGFR mutations who progressed on prior chemotherapy experienced an ORR of 50% (30/60) from afatinib in a Phase 4 trial (Thongprasert et al., 2019; 31807143). A retrospective study of afatinib administered to Asian patients with NSCLC, 99% of whom were previously treated with erlotinib and/or gefitinib, reported an ORR of 27% for patients with common sensitizing EGFR mutations and an ORR of 24% for the entire cohort (Chang et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_11).

A Phase 2 trial of osimertinib in combination with bevacizumab versus osimertinib monotherapy for patients with untreated advanced non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR del19 or L858R reported no difference in ORR (82% vs 86%) and median PFS (22.1 vs 20.2 months, HR 0.862 p=0.213) (Kenmotsu et al., 2022; 35636696). The Phase 2 BOOSTER study of osimertinib in combination with bevacizumab versus osimertinib monotherapy for patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR_sensitizing mutations (exon 19 del or L858R) and L790M at progression on prior EGFR TKI reported no difference in ORR (55% vs 55%), median OS (24.0 vs 24.3 months, HR 1.03 p=0.91), or median PFS (15.4 vs 12.3 months, HR 0.96 p=0.83), although improved PFS was observed for the combination in the subgroup of current or former smokers (16.5 vs 8.4, HR 0.52) while nonsmokers had no benefit (HR 1.47) (Soo et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract VP3_2021). The Phase 1b TATTON study of osimertinib in combination with selumetinib, savolitinib, or durvalumab for patients with previously treated EGFR_mutated NSCLC reported ORRs of 42% (15/36), 44% (8/18), and 44% (10/23), respectively (Oxnard et al., 2020; 32139298). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Cetuximab", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets EGFR.

A Phase 2 study of 31 patients with NSCLC found the addition of cetuximab to radiotherapy and chemotherapy produced an ORR of 67%; EGFR gene copy number was not predictive of efficacy outcome in this trial (Ramalingam et al., 2013; 23849982). A Phase 3 study of 938 patients with progressive NSCLC after platinum_based therapy concluded the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy was not recommended in this second_line setting (Kim et al., 2013; 24231627). Cetuximab is also being studied as part of a therapeutic regimen for patients with NSCLC with EGFR mutations who develop secondary resistance to erlotinib or gefitinib. A Phase 1b study combining afatinib and cetuximab for patients with either T790M_positive or T790M_negative tumors observed an overall ORR of 29% and comparable response rates in both groups (32% T790M positive vs. 25% T790M negative) (Janjigian et al., 2014; 25074459). A Phase 1 study evaluating the combination treatment of erlotinib and cetuximab for patients with NSCLC regardless of EGFR status, including squamous tumors, as well as those who had progressed on prior erlotinib treatment, reported PRs in 10% (2/20) of patients and SDs lasting at least 6 months in 15% (3/20) of patients (Wheler et al., 2013; 23963360); in addition, a retrospective analysis of this trial identified a patient who had an exon 19 deletion and T790M who progressed rapidly on cetuximab and erlotinib (Tsigelny et al., 2015; 25760241). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Erlotinib", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Erlotinib is a small_molecule inhibitor of EGFR.

For patients with activating mutations in EGFR, treatment with erlotinib has been associated with improved response and lengthened time to progression (Cappuzzo et al., 2010; 20493771, Rosell et al., 2012; 22285168, Zhong et al., 2019; 31194613, Petrelli et al., 2011; 22056888). For patients with esophageal or biliary cancer treated with erlotinib or gefitinib, elevated EGFR copy number or amplification is associated with clinical responses and longer survival (Petty et al., 2017; 28537764, Philip et al., 2006; 16809731, Xie et al., 2020; 32958820, Luo et al., 2020; 33026449, Lee et al., 2012; 22192731). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> In one study, median PFS (4.1 vs. 11.7 months, HR=9.7) and median OS (14.1 vs. 47.0 months, HR=10.2) were significantly shorter for patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR L747_A750>P (n=6) relative to those with deletions affecting EGFR E746_A750 (n=24) treated with first_line erlotinib (Truini et al., 2019; 31182434). For patients with EGFR_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the Phase 3 EURTAC trial improved PFS with first_line erlotinib relative to platinum_based chemotherapy (9.7 vs. 5.2 months, HR=0.37), though OS was not prolonged (22.9 vs. 19.6 months, HR=0.92) (Rosell et al., 2012; 22285168, Leon et al., 2014; doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdu349.52). This study and meta_analyses attribute the lack of OS benefit to the effectiveness of post_progression salvage therapy in the control arm (Lee et al., 2017; 28376144). A Phase 3 study reported similar efficacy of erlotinib and gefitinib for patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC (Yang et al., 2017; 28103612). Patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC have experienced PFS benefit with the addition of bevacizumab to erlotinib in the first_line setting in Phase 3 trials, including the ARTEMIS_CTONG1509 trial for Chinese patients (17.9 vs. 11.2 months, HR=0.55) (Zhou et al., 2021; 34388377), the NEJ026 trial for Japanese patients (16.9 vs. 13.3 months, HR=0.605) (Kawashima et al., 2022; 34454653, Saito et al., 2019; 30975627), and the international BEVERLY trial (15.4 vs. 9.7 months, HR=0.60) (Piccirillo et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 12070); OS benefit has not been observed across these studies. In the maintenance setting, Phase 3 trials have reported significantly improved PFS with maintenance erlotinib following first_line platinum_based chemotherapy, with patients with EGFR mutations experiencing the largest benefit (Cappuzzo et al., 2010; 20493771, Faehling et al., 2018; 29687154). In the neoadjuvant setting, a Phase 2 trial reported a numerically improved ORR and significantly longer PFS with erlotinib compared with chemotherapy for patients with EGFR_mutated advanced NSCLC (Zhong et al., 2019; 31194613). In the placebo_controlled Phase 3 RELAY trial, the addition of ramucirumab to erlotinib improved PFS for previously untreated patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR L858R or exon 19 deletion (19.4 vs. 12.4 months, HR=0.59) (Nakagawa et al., 2019; 31591063). A Phase 2 trial of cabozantinib plus erlotinib for patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC who progressed on EGFR TKI reported an ORR of 11%, median PFS of 3.6 months, and median OS of 13.3 months; PFS and OS were similar for patients with or without T790M mutations (Reckamp et al., 2019; 30915273). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT05338970", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05120349", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04988295", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05215548", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05442060", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03974022", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03114319", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04077463", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04862780", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02099058", "Include": "true"}]}}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "FGFR1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "FGFR1 encodes the protein fibroblast growth factor receptor 1, which plays key roles in regulation of the cell cycle and angiogenesis and is an upstream regulator of the RAS, MAPK, and AKT signaling pathways (Turner and Grose, 2010; 20094046). Amplification of FGFR1 has been correlated with protein expression (Kohler et al., 2012; 22648708, Kim et al., 2013; 23182986) and may predict pathway activation and sensitivity to therapies targeting this pathway (Andr\u00e9 et al., 2014; 24508104, Dienstmann et al., 2014; 24265351). In the TCGA datasets, FGFR1 amplification was found in 3% of lung adenocarcinoma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552) and 17% of lung SCC cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745); FGFR1 mutation was observed in 1% of lung adenocarcinoma and lung SCC (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745). The prognostic significance of FGFR1 alteration in lung adenocarcinoma has not been extensively studied; however, 1 analysis of 345 non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases (48% adenocarcinoma, 39% squamous cell carcinoma [SCC], 7% large cell) suggested that high level amplification of FGFR1 was predictive of shorter survival (Gadgeel et al., 2013; 24255716). The association between FGFR1 amplification and clinical parameters in lung SCC is not clear; some studies have suggested that FGFR1 amplification is associated with poor prognosis, whereas others have reported no association (Cote et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract 7063, Kim et al., 2013; 23182986, Heist et al., 2012; 23154548, Kohler et al., 2012; 22648708, Craddock et al., 2013; 24077455). 1 study reported significant association between FGFR1 amplification and improved OS for patients assigned female (p=0.023), but not male (p=0.423), at birth (Flockerzi et al., 2018; 29270870). Alterations that activate FGFR1 may predict sensitivity to selective FGFR inhibitors including erdafitinib (Loriot et al., 2019; 31340094, Tabernero et al., 2015; 26324363, Karkera et al., 2017; 28416604, Park et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 4117), pemigatinib (Necchi et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 900P, Subbiah et al., 2022; 35176457), infigratinib (Pal et al., 2018; 29848605, Pal et al., 2020; 32208524), futibatinib (Bahleda et al., 2020; 32622884, Meric_Bernstam et al., 2022; 34551969, Kasbekar et al., 2020; 32649766), rogaratinib (Schuler et al., 2019; 31405822), Debio 1347 (Sait et al., 2021; 34250399, Voss et al., 2019; 30745300), and derazantinib (Papadopoulos et al., 2017; 28972963) or to multikinase inhibitors such as pazopanib (Cheng et al., 2017; 29223982, Yuan et al., 2016; SABCS Abstract P6_16_08) and ponatinib (Khodaoust et al., 2015; 26055304, Tanasi et al., 2019; 31434701, Strati et al., 2018; 29119847, Kreil et al., 2015; ASH Abstract 2812). The activity and efficacy of selective FGFR inhibitors for FGFR1_amplified tumors has been modest, with limited responses reported in FGFR1_amplified lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) treated with infigratinib (Nogova et al., 2017; 27870574) or AZD457 (Aggarwal et al., 2019; 31195180), in FGFR1_amplifed uterine cancer treated with pemigatinib (Subbiah et al., 2022; 35176457), and no responses reported among patients with FGFR1_amplified breast cancer treated with infigratinib (Nogova et al., 2017; 27870574) or pemigatinib (Subbiah et al., 2022; 35176457).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), 20q gain has been associated with BCL_XL protein overexpression (Sillars_Hardebol et al., 2012; 22009326). BCL2L1 amplification has been observed in 1_6% of solid tumor samples, including colorectal (5%) and ovarian (6%) cancers (cBio_Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011; 21720365, cBio_Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359). Studies suggest that expression of BCL_XL may be associated with poor prognosis for patients with ovarian cancer (Williams et al., 2005; 15661210), pleural mesothelioma (Aurlananda et al., 2020; 34131107), and colorectal cancer (CRC)(Biroccio et al., 2001; 11290547). Elevated BCL_XL levels protect cancer cells against apoptosis in multiple cancer types, and has been associated with chemotherapy resistance for patients with ovarian cancer (Elstrand et al., 2009; 19620938, Williams et al., 2005; 15661210) and resistance to radiation and targeted therapies in preclinical studies (Lei et al., 2007; 17492131, Qian et al., 2009; 19139118, Aurlananda et al., 2020; 34131107, Morimoto et al., 2020; 32567031, Ritter et al., 2021; 34257274, Lee et al., 2022; 34913280). Multiple investigational therapies that target BCL_2 family members, including ABT_737, navitoclax, pelcitoclax, A_1331852, and obatoclax, have been studied in preclinical studies or early_stage clinical trials (Kang et al., 2009; 19228717, Wang et al., 2020; 33062160); clinical studies have been conducted in genomically unselected populations. Single_agent navitoclax has been evaluated in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies where it demonstrated limited efficacy (ORR 2.6%, SD rate 20_23%); 2 patients achieved PRs, including a patient with small cell lung cancer who benefited for over 2 years (Gandhi et al., 2011; 21282543, Rudin et al., 2013; 22496272). Navitoclax has also been evaluated in combination with the EGFR TKI erlotinib, though no ORs were observed (27% SD rate, [3/11])(Tolcher et al., 2015; 26420235). In a Phase 1 trial for patients with advanced non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the combination of pelcitoclax and EGFR TKI osimertinib resulted in an ORR of 15% (3/20)(Zhang et al., 2021; WCLC Abstract MA02.06).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "MCL1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "MCL1 (myeloid cell leukemia 1) encodes a member of the BCL2 family that regulates apoptosis (Quinn et al., 2011; 21851287). Focal amplification of MCL1 has been reported in lung, breast, and other cancer types, and the survival of cells with MCL1 amplification is dependent on MCL1 expression (Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). In non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), MCL1 amplification was significantly associated with increased MCL1 mRNA expression (Yin et al., 2016; 27264345). Although several MCL1 phosphorylation site mutations have been characterized (Thomas et al., 2010; 20540941), cancer_associated MCL1 mutations have not been reported (PubMed, 2023). MCL1 amplification has been reported at the highest incidence in lung adenocarcinoma (16%) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014; 25079552), breast invasive carcinoma (15%) (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 23000897), hepatocellular carcinoma (15%), and bladder urothelial carcinoma (13%) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014; 24476821) and at lower frequencies in other solid tumor types (cBioPortal, 2023) (Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). MCL1 mutations have been reported in <1% of solid and hematologic cancers (COSMIC, 2023) (Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), MCL1 amplification was significantly associated with shorter OS (HR=1.39) (Yin et al., 2016; 27264345); high MCL1 protein expression alone was not prognostic in NSCLC (Schmidt et al., 2014; 25036876, Borner et al., 1999; 10070896, Wesarg et al., 2007; 17688235), whereas overexpression of both MCL1 and MYC was linked with poor survival (Allen et al., 2011; 21406400). High MCL1 expression has also been associated with poor prognosis in ovarian (Shigemasa et al., 2002; 12036450, Baekelandt et al., 2000; 11078490) and colorectal cancers (CRC) (Lee et al., 2014; 25628923). The prognostic significance of MCL1 expression in breast cancer is not clear (Ding et al., 2007; 17495324, O Driscoll et al., 2004; 15152946). There are no approved therapies to target MCL1 amplification, but MCL1 inhibitors including AMG 176, AMG 397, AZD5991, and S64315 (MIK665) are in early clinical development (Hird and Tron, 2019; 30790641, Caenepeel et al., 2018; 30254093, Tron et al., 2018; 30559424, Ramsey et al., 2018; 30185627). Limited preclinical data suggest that MCL1 expression alone may not be predictive of sensitivity to MCL1 inhibitors, but BH3 profiling may be a better predictor of MCL1 dependence (Caenepeel et al., 2018; 30254093, Kotschy et al., 2016; 27760111, Koch et al., 2019; 30498064, Ramsey et al., 2018; 30185627). Clinical and preclinical data indicate that increased MCL1 expression may be associated with resistance to BCL2_targeted agents such as venetoclax, navitoclax, or ABT_737 (Bose et al., 2017; 28140720, Roberts et al., 2012; 2218437, Konopleva et al., 2016; 27520294, Kumar et al., 2017; 29018077, Lin et al., 2016; 27283158, Suryani et al., 2014; 25013123, van Delft et al., 2006; 17097561, Konopleva et al., 2006; 17097560). In one study, amplification of the genomic locus containing MCL1 was acquired upon disease progression in patients with multiple myeloma treated with venetoclax (Neri et al., 2019; ASH Abstract 572). Combined inhibition of MCL1 and BCL2 may be more effective (Ramsey et al., 2018; 30185627, Moujalled et al., 2019; 30214012, Caenepeel et al., 2018; 30254093, Tron et al., 2018; 30559424, Leverson et al., 2015; 25590800). Indirect approaches using therapeutic agents that reduce MCL1 expression are also being investigated (Xiang et al., 2018; 30425521). Preclinical studies demonstrate that investigational cyclin_dependent kinase inhibitors targeting CDK9, such as dinaciclib, alvocidib, and voruciclib, suppress gene transcription, reduce MCL1 expression levels, and synergize with BCL2 inhibitors to induce apoptosis (Chen et al., 2016; 27469405, Jane et al., 2016; 26585571, Li et al., 2015; 25882699, Booher et al., 2014; 25289887, Zhou et al., 2018; 29241222, Bogenberger et al., 2017; 29291023, Chen et al., 2012; 22693249, Dey et al., 2017; 29269870). Preclinical studies in multiple types of cancer cells have also shown that the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib indirectly downregulates MCL1 and cooperates with BCL2_targeting agents (Arai et al., 2018; 30021909, Kiprianova et al., 2015; 26297434, Ricci et al., 2007; 17613437, Meng et al., 2007; 17698840), and a heavily pretreated patient with metastatic triple_negative breast cancer (TNBC) and MCL1 gene amplification responded to sorafenib in combination with several other therapies (Ali et al., 2016; 27293397). Preclinical studies of patient_derived tumor cells suggest that increased MCL1 levels may confer resistance to antitubulin therapies such as paclitaxel (Wertz et al., 2011; 21368834), and MCL1 amplification was reported to be more frequent in patients with TNBC and primary resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Balko et al., 2014; 24356096).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI_H is generally infrequent in NSCLC, reported in fewer than 1% of samples across several large studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197, Ninomiya et al., 2006; 16641899, Vanderwalde et al., 2018; 29436178, Zang et al., 2019; 31270941, Dudley et al., 2016; 26880610, Takamochi et al., 2017; 28676214, Schrock et al., 2017; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2016.11.487), whereas data on the reported incidence of MSI_H in SCLC has been limited and conflicting (Pylkkanen et al., 1997; 9329646, Gonzalez et al., 2000; 11061602, Chen et al., 1996; 8782463, Merlo et al., 1994; 8174113). One study reported MSI_H in lung adenocarcinoma patients with smoking history, and 3 of 4 MSI_H patients examined also had metachronous carcinomas in other organs, although this has not been investigated in large scale studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of MSI in NSCLC are limited (PubMed, Oct 2022). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "NFKBIA", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "true", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "NFKBIA encodes IkBa, an inhibitor of the NF_kappaB (NFkB)/REL complex.

Amplification of NKX2_1 has been reported with the highest incidence in lung adenocarcinoma (14%) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014; 25079552) and less frequently in lung squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) (5%) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2012; 22960745). NKX2_1 amplification has also been observed in other solid tumors, including prostate adenocarcinomas (6%) (Kumar et al., 2016; 26928463, Abida et al., 2019; 31061129) and thyroid cancers (6%) (Landa et al., 2016; 26878173, Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359).

SRC has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210) and may be biologically relevant in this context (Zack et al., 2013; 24071852, Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). In the TCGA datasets, SRC amplification was observed in 1.1% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (SCC)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745) and 1.7% of lung adenocarcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552).

TP53 is one of the most commonly mutated genes in lung cancer; mutations have been reported in 43_80% of non_small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745, Mogi and Kuwano, 2011; 21331359, Tekpli et al., 2013; 23011884, Vignot et al., 2013; 23630207, Maeng et al., 2013; 24222160, Cortot et al., 2014; 24169260, Itakura et al., 2013; 23922113), including 42_52% of lung adenocarcinomas and 58_83% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (cBioPortal, COSMIC, 2023)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, cBio_Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745, Kim et al., 2014; 24323028, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878, Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). TP53 homozygous deletion has been observed in 1.4% of lung adenocarcinoma and <1% of lung squamous cell carcinoma cases (cBioPortal, 2023)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). In one study of 55 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, TP53 alterations correlated with immunogenic features including PD_L1 expression, tumor mutation burden and neoantigen presentation; likely as a consequence of this association TP53 mutations correlated with improved clinical outcomes to PD_1 inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab in this study (Dong et al., 2016; 28039262). Mutations in TP53 have been associated with lymph node metastasis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (Seo et al., 2012; 22975805). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

A large_scale genomic analysis found that unspecified lung non_small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), lung adenocarcinoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) samples harbored median TMBs between 6.3 and 9 Muts/Mb, and 12% to 17% of cases had an elevated TMB of greater than 20 Muts/Mb (FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). Lower TMB is observed more commonly in NSCLCs harboring known driver mutations (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, or MET) with the exception of BRAF or KRAS mutations, which are commonly observed in elevated TMB cases (Spigel et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9017). Although some studies have reported a lack of association between smoking and mutational burden in NSCLC (Schwartz et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 8533, Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843, Shim et al., 2015; 26200269), several other large studies did find a strong association with increased TMB (Govindan et al., 2012; 22980976, Ding et al., 2008; 18948947, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Kim et al., 2014; 24323028). TMB >10 muts/Mb was found to be more frequent in NSCLC metastases compared with primary tumors for both adenocarcinoma (38% vs. 25%) and SCC (41% vs. 35%) subtypes (Stein et al., 2019; DOI: 10.1200/PO.18.00376). A meta_analysis of 19 studies of immune checkpoint inhibitor_treated NSCLC (n = 2,315 patients) demonstrated that high TMB predicted a significantly longer OS than low TMB (HR = 0.70), and within the high TMB group, immunotherapy was associated with an improved PFS (HR = 0.62, P<0.001), OS (HR = 0.67, P<0.001) and a higher response rate (OR = 2.35, P<0.001) compared to chemotherapy (Meng et al., 2022; 35113949). In contrast, a large study of Chinese patients with untreated lung adenocarcinoma reported a shorter median OS for tumors with a higher number of mutations in a limited gene set compared with a lower mutation number (48.4 vs. 61.0 months)(Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843). Another study of patients with NSCLC treated with EGFR inhibitors or platinum doublet chemotherapy found elevated TMB to be correlated with poorer prognosis, as well as finding lower TMB in combination with PD_L1 negative status to be significantly associated with longer median survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). However, no significant prognostic association of TMB and/or PD_L1 status with survival has been reported in patients with lung SCC (Yu et al., 2019; 30253973, Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). Multiple clinical trials of PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors or combination of PD_1 and CTLA_4 inhibitors in NSCLC have reported that patients with tumors harboring TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb derive greater clinical benefit from these therapies than those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb (based on this assay or others); similarly, higher efficacy of anti_PD_1 or anti_PD_L1 immunotherapy for treatment of patients with NSCLC, compared with the use of chemotherapy, has been observed more significantly in cases of TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (based on this assay or others); (Spigel et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9017, Hellmann et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT077, Ramalingam et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT078, Kowanetz et al., 2016; ESMO Abstract 77P, Gandara et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 12950, Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Velcheti et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12001, Herbst et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA79, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT07, Castellanos et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 2630, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Colli et al., 2016; 27197178, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Wang et al., 2017; 28923100, Carbone et al., 2017; 28636851, Rizvi et al., 2018; 29337640, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Forde et al., 2018; 29658848, Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Miao et al., 2018; 30150660, Chae et al., 2019; 30425022). Improved OS of patients with NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy relative to chemotherapy only (Paz_Ares et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA80), or those treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab also relative to chemotherapy (Hellmann et al., 2019; 31562796), has been observed across all TMB levels.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null,
