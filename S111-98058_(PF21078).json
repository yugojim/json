KEAP1 exerts anti_tumor effects through negative regulation of NRF2, a transcription factor encoded by NFE2L2 (Wakabayashi et al., 2003; 14517554, Kansanen et al., 2013; 24024136, Hast et al., 2013; 23382044); KEAP1 inactivation promotes cancer progression through NRF2_mediated chemoresistance and cell growth (Kansanen et al., 2013; 24024136, Hast et al., 2013; 23382044). Somatic mutation of KEAP1 occurs in a range of solid tumors, including gastric, hepatocellular, colorectal, and lung cancers (Yoo et al., 2012; 22348534). KEAP1 mutations are rare in hematological malignancies, occurring in fewer than 1% of samples analyzed (COSMIC, 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). In a retrospective analysis of the pan_solid MSKCC dataset, KEAP1 mutation correlated with reduced OS (13.28 vs. 26.53 months) (Xu et al., 2020; 32272498). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), mutation of KEAP1 and/or NFE2L2 also correlated with reduced median OS (11.51 vs. 22.32 months) (Xu et al., 2020; 32272498). In another study, for NSCLC treated with frontline chemotherapy, multivariate analysis showed that KEAP1 and/or NFE2L2 mutations significantly associated with reduced survival for patients with adenocarcinoma (PFS HR=2.34, OS HR=1.96) but not for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (Goeman et al., 2019; 31323387). A study of patients with localized non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) identified pathogenic KEAP1 and NFE2L2 mutations as predictors of local recurrence following radiotherapy but not surgery; limited preclinical data also showed that treatment with a glutaminase inhibitor sensitized KEAP1_mutated NSCLC cells to radiation (Binkley et al., 2020; 33071215). In other preclinical studies, treatment with AKT inhibitors sensitized lung cancer cells harboring KEAP1 or NFE2L2 mutations to both chemotherapy and radiation therapy (Chowdhry et al., 2013; 22964642, Abazeed et al., 2013; 23980093). Mixed clinical data have been reported for the association between KEAP1 mutations and the response to immunotherapy. A pan_cancer study of immunotherapy showed that patients with KEAP1 mutations had shorter OS (10 vs. 20 months) than those without (Chen et al., 2020; 32175433). However, another study across solid tumors showed that KEAP1 mutations were associated with higher tumor mutational burden (TMB) and PD_L1 expression, as well as improved survival outcomes with immunotherapy compared with other treatments (20.0 vs. 11.5 months) (Xu et al., 2020; 32272498). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a study of PD_L1 inhibitors showed that patients with concurrent mutations of STK11 and KEAP1 (n=39) experienced significantly shorter PFS (1.6 vs. 2.5 months, HR=1.5) and OS (4 vs. 11 months, HR=1.9) compared with patients with STK11_ and KEAP1_wildtype tumors (n=210) despite significantly higher TMB in the group harboring STK11 and KEAP1 mutations (median 9.4 vs. 6.1 Muts/Mb) (Arbour et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract MA19.09). Retrospective analyses of patients with NSCLC who received immunotherapy reported reduced OS (p=0.040) for patients harboring KEAP1_ or NFE2L2_mutated tumors (Zhang et al., 2020; 32471565) or STK11_ or KEAP1_mutated tumors (p <0.001) (Shang et al., 2020; WCLC Abstract P75.02) compared with those without. Studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with lung adenocarcinoma showed that coexisting mutations between KEAP1, PBRM1, SMARCA4, STK11, and KRAS were associated with worse OS (Marinelli et al., 2020; 32866624, Ricciuti et al., 2020; WCLC Abstract P14.26). An exploratory analysis of a subset of patients with PD_L1_positive NSCLC treated in the first_line setting with pembrolizumab showed similar ORR, PFS, and OS when comparing patients with STK11 or KEAP1 mutations and those without (Cho et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT084). In addition, preclinical data suggest that KEAP1 inactivation increases tumor demand for glutamine and increases tumor sensitivity to glutaminase inhibitors like telaglenastat (Gwinn et al., 2018; 29316436, Sayin et al., 2017; 28967864, Romero et al., 2017; 28967920). Limited clinical data suggest that KEAP1 mutations may predict improved clinical benefit from combinations of glutaminase inhibitors and anti_PD_1 inhibitors (Skoulidis et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract TPS9627); a Phase 1/2 study of the glutaminase inhibitor telaglenastat (CB_839) plus nivolumab to treat advanced NSCLC reported better clinical benefit rates and median PFS for patients with KEAP1 mutations (75% [3/4] vs. 15% [2/13], 6.4 vs. 3.7 months), KRAS mutations (38% [3/8] vs. 20% [2/10], 4.5 vs. 3.7 months), or KEAP1 and KRAS concurrent mutations (100% [2/2] vs. 13% [1/8], 7.2 vs. 3.7 months) compared with patients without these mutations (Skoulidis et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract TPS9627). The KEAP1 mutation has also been identified as a potential biomarker for sensitivity to combined AKT and TXNRD1 inhibition in lung cancer (Dai et al., 2013; 23824739).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "KEAP1 inactivation may predict sensitivity to glutaminase inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04265534", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03872427", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04250545", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "KRAS", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "G12C", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "G12C"}}, "Interpretation": "KRAS encodes a member of the RAS family of small GTPases. Activating mutations in RAS genes can cause uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor formation (Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Kahn et al., 1987; 3310850). Clinical benefit has been reported for patients with KRAS G12C_mutated solid tumors following treatment with G12C inhibitors such as sotorasib (Canon et al., 2019; 31666701, Lanman et al., 2020; 31820981, Hong et al., 2020; 32955176) or adagrasib (Hallin et al., 2019; 31658955, Janne et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 3LBA, Johnson et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 4LBA). However, clinical and preclinical resistance to G12C inhibitors, either by emergence of additional alterations in KRAS or other genes in the RTK/MAPK/PI3K pathway, have also been observed (Awad et al., 2021; 34161704, Tanaka et al., 2021; 33824136, Ryan et al., 2020; 31776128, Dunnett_Kane et al., 2021; 33466360). KRAS alterations affecting amino acids G12, G13, Q22, P34, A59, Q61, and A146, as well as mutations G10_A11insG, G10_A11insAG (also reported as G10_A11dup and G12_G13insAG), A18D, L19F, D33E, G60_A66dup/E62_A66dup, E62K, R68S, and K117N have been characterized as activating and oncogenic (Akagi et al., 2007; 17150185, Bollag et al., 1996; 8955068, Buhrman et al., 2010; 20194776, Colicelli, 2004; 15367757, Edkins et al., 2006; 16969076, Feig and Cooper, 1988; 3043178, Gremer et al., 2011; 20949621, Janakiraman et al., 2010; 20570890, Kim et al., 2016; 27147599, Lukman et al., 2010; 20838576, Naguib et al., 2011; 21371307, Prior et al., 2012; 22589270, Priv\u00e9 et al., 1992; 1565661, Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Scheffzek et al., 1997; 9219684, Scholl et al., 2009; 19490892, Smith et al., 2010; 20147967, Tyner et al., 2009; 19075190, Valencia et al., 1991; 2029511, White et al., 2016; 26854029, Wiest et al., 1994; 8058307, Kim et al., 2016; 27147599, Angeles et al., 2019; 31289513, Tong et al., 2014; 24642870, Loree et al., 2021; 34117033). KRAS G12C mutations have been identified in 14% of non_small cell lung cancers (Nassar et al., 2021; 33497555). Studies have reported KRAS mutations in 10_38% of non_small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), including 27_37% of lung adenocarcinomas (cBio_Ding et al., 2008; 18948947, cBio_Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, Aviel_Ronen et al., 2006; 16870043, Villaruz et al., 2013; 23526491, Rekhtman et al., 2013; 23619604, Ragusa et al., 2013; 23357969, Kim et al., 2013; 23307237, Russell et al., 2013; 23486266, Stella et al., 2013; 23644698, Cai et al., 2013; 23495083, Yip et al., 2013; 23392229), 10.5_33% of lung adenosquamous carcinomas (Tochigi et al., 2011; 21502435, Shu et al., 2013; 22996376, Wang et al., 2014; 24481316), 22% of lung large cell carcinoma without neuroendocrine features, and 6% of lung large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (Karlsson et al., 2015; 26124082). KRAS mutation in lung adenocarcinoma has been correlated with disease progression, poorly differentiated tumors, and aggressive tumor behavior (NCCN NSCLC Guidelines, v4.2021)(Yip et al., 2013; 23392229, Rekhtman et al., 2013; 23619604, Scoccianti et al., 2012; 22267755). However, the prognostic value of KRAS mutation in lung adenocarcinoma may differ among ethnic groups and may depend upon the specific allelic variant present (T\u00edm\u00e1r, 2014; 24463346). KRAS mutation was associated with shorter PFS (7.0 vs. 8.6 months, p=0.026) and OS (14.2 vs. 21.6 months, p=0.019) with first_line treatment with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in a retrospective study (Ghimessy et al., 2019; 31600989) and a lower major pathological response rate (0% [0/10] vs. 35.5% [11/31]) after neoadjuvant bevacizumab plus chemotherapy followed by adjuvant bevacizumab in a Phase 2 trial (Chaft et al., 2013; 23857398), relative to those patients lacking KRAS mutation. However, addition of atezolizumab to first_line bevacizumab and chemotherapy improved PFS regardless of KRAS status in the Phase 3 IMpower150 study (HR=0.50 for KRAS mutant vs. 0.47 for KRAS wild_type vs. 0.67 for KRAS unknown) (Socinski et al., 2018; 29863955). In one study of 55 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, KRAS mutations, especially in combination with TP53 alterations, correlated with improved clinical outcomes to PD_1 inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab, likely as a consequence of association with some immunogenic features such as tumor mutation burden (Dong et al., 2016; 28039262). In a Phase 1 study evaluating the MEK_pan_RAF dual inhibitor CH5126766, 6 patients harboring KRAS mutations experienced PRs, including 3 with non_small cell lung cancer (NCSLC), 1 with low_grade serous ovarian carcinoma (LGSOC), 1 with endometrial adenocarcinoma, and 1 with multiple myeloma (Guo et al., 2020; 3312887). Another Phase 1 study of CH5126766 combined with the FAK inhibitor defactinib reported 4 PRs in KRAS_mutated LGSOC (Shinde et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT143). KRAS G12C may predict sensitivity to G12C_targeted inhibitors such as sotorasib (Canon et al., 2019; 31666701, Lanman et al., 2020; 31820981, Hong et al., 2020; 32955176) and adagrasib (Hallin et al., 2019; 31658955, Janne et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 3LBA, Johnson et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 4LBA). The Phase 1/2 CodeBreaK 100 trial of sotorasib in G12C_mutated solid tumors observed clinical benefit for patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and colorectal cancer (CRC), with additional responses observed in several other tumor types (Skoulidis et al., 2021; 34096690, Hong et al., 2020; 32955176, Fakih et al., 2022; 34919824). In the Phase 1/2 KRYSTAL_1 trial, treatment with single_agent adagrasib elicited a 45% (23/51) ORR and a 96% (49/51) DCR for patients with G12C_mutated NSCLC (Janne et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 3LBA). Responses to single_agent adagrasib were also reported for patients with other types of G12C_mutated tumors, including an ORR of 17% (3/18) for patients with CRC and individual responses reported for patients with endometrial cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, and cholangiocarcinoma (1 confirmed or unconfirmed PR each) (Johnson et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 4LBA). Preclinical data suggest that sotorasib in combination with the EGFR inhibitor cetuximab may lead to more effective suppression of KRAS G12C_mutated CRC tumors (Amodio et al., 2020; 32430388). Preclinical and clinical data suggest that KRAS mutations may predict clinical benefit from SHP2 inhibitors (Lu et al., 2019; 31068384, Mainardi et al., 2018; 29808006, Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001, Brana et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3005, Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). A Phase 1 study of RMC_4630 for relapsed/refractory solid tumors reported a DCR of 58% (23/40) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS mutations and a DCR of 75% (12/16) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS G12C mutations (Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001). Interim results from a Phase 1/2 study of RMC_4630 plus cobimetinib reported tumor reduction in 3 of 8 patients with KRAS_mutated colorectal cancer (Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). Preclinical evidence suggests that KRAS activation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, such as trametinib, binimetinib, cobimetinib, and selumetinib (Nakano et al., 1984; 6320174, Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Yamaguchi et al., 2011; 21523318, Watanabe et al., 2013; 23438367, Gilmartin et al., 2011; 21245089, Yeh et al., 2009; 19372556). Multiple clinical studies have reported either low response rates or response rates similar to those of chemotherapy in patients with KRAS_mutated NSCLC receiving MEK inhibitors as a monotherapy (Blumenschein et al., 2015; 25722381, Leijen et al., 2012; 22767668, Zimmer et al., 2014; 24947927). In a Phase 3 study, the addition of selumetinib to docetaxel did not significantly improve the PFS or OS of patients with KRAS_mutant NSCLC relative to docetaxel alone (Janne et al., 2017; 28492898). In a Phase 1/1b study evaluating trametinib with either docetaxel or pemetrexed, responses were independent of KRAS mutation status (Gandara et al., 2017; 27876675). Combinatorial approaches involving MEK inhibitors and other targeted therapies, including PI3K or EGFR inhibitors, have generally had limited clinical efficacy in patients with NSCLC and have been associated with high toxicity (Carter et al., 2016; 26802155, Bedard et al., 2014; 25500057, Tolcher et al., 2014; 25344362) despite preclinical evidence supporting the effectiveness of combinatorial strategies involving inhibitors of PI3K (Castellano et al., 2013; 24229709, Ku et al., 2014; 25342139), RAF (Lamba et al., 2014; 25199829), pan_ERBB (Sun et al, 2014; 24685132), or BCL2 (Hata et al., 2014; 24675361, Tan et al., 2013; 23475955). Preclinical data suggest that KRAS mutation may confer sensitivity to SOS1 inhibitors (Hillig et al., 2019; 30683722, Hofmann et al., 2021; 32816843, Gerlach et al., 2020; AACR Abstract 1091). Phase 1 studies of the SOS1 inhibitor BI 1701963 alone or in combination with MEK inhibitors, KRAS G12C inhibitors, or irinotecan are recruiting for patients with solid tumors harboring KRAS mutations (Hofmann et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT210, Gort et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract TPS3651). However, a Phase 1 combination trial of the MEK inhibitor PD_0325901 with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib that included 17 patients with KRAS_mutant NSCLC reported 1 PR, >50% SD, and 5 patients with PFS >6 months; clinical benefit was seen among patients with tumors harboring KRAS mutation alone or together with inactivation of TP53 or CDKN2A/B, but not among patients with tumors harboring KRAS mutation and STK11 inactivation (Shapiro et al., 2017; AACR Abstract CT046). The CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib demonstrated increased activity in KRAS_mutated NSCLC compared to KRAS_wildtype NSCLC (median PFS of 2.8 vs. 1.9 months) in a Phase 1 trial (Patnaik et al., 2016; 27217383) but did not prolong median OS compared to erlotinib (7.4 vs. 7.8 months, HR=0.97), in spite of improved PFS (3.6 vs. 1.9 months, HR=0.58) and ORR (8.9% vs. 2.7%) relative to erlotinib, in a Phase 3 study for patients with platinum_refractory KRAS_mutated advanced NSCLC (Goldman et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 9025). Although some studies have suggested that KRAS mutation status may predict a lack of response to the EGFR inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib in patients with lung cancer, a retrospective study suggests that there is no statistically significant difference in response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors among KRAS_wildtype and KRAS_mutated patients (Mao et al., 2010; 20022659, Sun et al., 2013; 23724098, Pao et al., 2005; 15696205, Ludovini et al., 2011; 21258250). A study assessing the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab for pretreated patients with KRAS_mutated (n=206) or KRAS_wildtype (n=324) advanced NSCLC observed a similar ORR (20% vs. 17%), median PFS (4 vs. 3 months) and OS (11.2 vs. 10 months) in both cohorts, although the 3_month PFS rate was significantly longer in KRAS_positive than KRAS_negative patients (53% vs. 42%) (Passiglia et al., 2018; 30377342). Co_occurring KRAS and STK11 alterations are associated with poorer response to immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with NSCLC. Following anti_PD_1_based regimens, retrospective analyses have reported shorter OS for patients with KRAS_ and STK11_mutated tumors than for those whose KRAS_mutated tumors were STK11_wildtype (6.4 vs. 16.1 months, HR=1.99), as well as markedly fewer objective responses for patients with KRAS_/STK11_mutated versus KRAS_/TP53_mutated tumors in the CheckMate_057 (0% [0/6] vs. 57% [4/7]) (Skoulidis et al., 2018; 29773717) and GEMINI (0% [0/6], vs. 53% [9/17]) (Skoulidis et al., 2017; IASLC 17th World Congress on Lung Cancer Abstract MA04.07). Another study observed that patients with NSCLC and KRAS_mutated tumors without STK11 alteration who were treated with second_line immunotherapy experienced similar median PFS (2.8 vs. 2.2 months, HR = 1.64) and numerically longer median OS (7.7 vs. 3.5 months, HR = 2.3; p=0.09) compared to patients harboring mutations in both KRAS and STK11 (Marmarelis et al., 2018, IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_64). A Phase 1 study on the combination of the RAF_MEK inhibitor CH5126766 and the FAK inhibitor defactinib in KRAS_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) reported a PR rate of 12% (2/17), including 100% (2/2) of patients with KRAS G12V mutations, and an SD rate of 59% (10/17)(Krebs et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT019). Additional clinical responses for patients with low_grade serous ovarian cancer (PR rate 50% [4/8]) and NSCLC (PR rate 10% [1/10]) with KRAS mutations have been reported (Shinde et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT143).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Clinical evidence suggests that patients with the KRAS G12C mutation may be sensitive to G12C_targeted inhibitors such as sotorasib and adagrasib.

LKB1 acts as a tumor suppressor in cancer, as loss of function promotes proliferation and tumorigenesis (Carretero et al., 2010; 20541700, Ollila et al., 2011; 21926085). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt STK11 function or expression (Qui et al., 2007; 16407837, Mehenni et al., 1998; 9837816, Karuman et al., 2001; 11430832, Baas et al., 2003; 12805220, Zeng and Berger, 2006; 17108107, Boudeau et al., 2004; 15561763, Scott et al., 2007; 17575127, Xie et al., 2009; 19414597, Boudeau et al., 2003; 12552571, Forcet et al., 2005; 15800014, Zhang et al., 2015; 25960268, Berger et al., 2016; 27478040). Several clinical studies have found STK11 mutation to be common in non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (15_35%), with alterations more prevalent in lung adenocarcinomas (13_34%) than in lung squamous cell carcinoma (2_19%) (Koivunen et al., 2008; 18594528, Ji et al., 2007; 17676035, An et al., 2012; 22768234, Liu et al., 2013; 23715154, Gao et al., 2010; 20559149, Hammerman et al., 2012; 22960745, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975). In the TCGA datasets, STK11 homozygous deletion was observed in 1% of lung adenocarcinoma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552) and was not observed in any of 178 lung squamous cell carcinoma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745). STK11 mutations in NSCLC often co_occur with activating KRAS mutations (Liu et al., 2013; 23715154, Gao et al., 2010; 20559149). In transgenic mouse models, animals expressing mutant KRAS developed lung adenocarcinomas, whereas the KRAS_mutant/LKB1_deficient mice developed an expanded histological spectrum of tumors that included large cell and squamous cell carcinomas (Ji et al., 2007; 17676035). Strongly decreased or absent expression of LKB1 correlated with inferior outcome in patients with NSCLC treated with bevacizumab_containing chemotherapy; expression of LKB1 was not prognostic in patients treated with chemotherapy without bevacizumab (Bonanno et al., 2017; 28119362). Increased mTOR signaling is present in LKB1_deficient tumors, suggesting therapies targeting mTOR may be relevant for tumors with STK11 alterations (Shaw et al., 2004; 15261145, Ji et al., 2007; 17676035, Contreras et al., 2008; 18245476, Gurumurthy et al., 2008; 18172296, Shackelford et al., 2009; 19541609). Case studies have reported PRs for 2 patients with STK11_mutated pancreatic cancer following treatment with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (Kl\u00fcmpen et al., 2011; 21189378, Moreira et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 315), with 1 PR observed in a PJS patient for 9 months until progression (Kl\u00fcmpen et al., 2011; 21189378). However, retrospective analysis of a Phase 2 trial for patients with endometrial carcinoma found LKB1 (STK11) protein levels were not significantly correlated with response to everolimus treatment (Tredan et al., 2013; 23238879). In one preclinical study, STK11 loss was associated with sensitivity to combination treatment including an SRC inhibitor (Carretero et al., 2010; 20541700); however, the clinical relevance of these findings has not been established. STK11 alteration is associated with poorer response to immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including those with tumors harboring co_occurring KRAS or KEAP1 mutations. Following anti_PD_1_based regimens, retrospective analyses have reported shorter OS for patients with KRAS and STK11 co_mutated tumors than for patients with wild_type STK11 (6.4 vs. 16.1 months, HR=1.99)(Skoulidis et al., 2018; 29773717), as well as markedly fewer objective responses for patients with KRAS/STK11 co_mutated versus KRAS/TP53 co_mutated tumors in the CheckMate_057, CheckMate_012, and GEMINI trials (0% vs. 53_78%%)(Skoulidis et al., 2018; 29773717, Skoulidis et al., 2017; IASLC 17th WCLC Abstract MA04.07, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128), although a case study reported ongoing response for 1 patient with KRAS/STK11 co_mutations treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab (Stein et al., 2019; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00211). Patients with NSCLC and concurrent mutation of STK11 and KEAP1 (n=39) who received treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor experienced significantly shorter PFS (1.6 vs. 2.5 months; HR=1.5) and OS (4 vs. 11 months; HR=1.9) compared with patients with STK11_ and KEAP1_wild_type tumors (n=210) despite significantly higher TMB in the group harboring STK11 and KEAP1 mutations (median 9.4 vs. 6.1 Muts/Mb) (Arbour et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract MA19.09). However, exploratory analyses of patients with NSCLC treated in the first_line setting with pembrolizumab showed trends towards improved ORR and OS irrespective of STK11 or KEAP1 mutation status, though this was not demonstrated to be statistically significant (Cho et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT084, Gadgeel et al., 2020; AACR Abstract LB_397). In the absence of co_mutations, reduced clinical benefit has also been reported for patients with NSCLC harboring STK11 mutations compared with wild_type STK11 and either anti_PD_L1 (Skoulidis et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract MA19.10, Jure_Kunkel et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 3028) or anti_PD_1 therapy (Stephens, 2017; AACR Abstract SY40_02). Germline mutations in STK11 underlie Peutz_Jeghers syndrome (PJS), a rare autosomal dominant disorder associated with a predisposition for tumor formation (Amos et al., 2004; 15121768). This disorder has an estimated frequency between 1:29,000 and 1:120,000, although reported rates in the literature vary greatly (Hearle et al., 2006; 16707622, Amos et al., 2004; 15121768, van der Groep et al., 2011; 21336636). Although gastrointestinal tumors are the most common malignancies associated with PJS, patients also exhibit an 18_fold increased risk of developing other epithelial cancers (Hearle et al., 2006; 16707622, Amos et al., 2004; 15121768, van der Groep et al., 2011; 21336636), and individuals with this syndrome have a 30_50% risk of developing breast cancer (Amos et al., 2004; 15121768, van der Groep et al., 2011; 21336636). Given the association with PJS, in the appropriate clinical context testing for the presence of germline mutations in STK11 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Increased mTOR signaling is present in LKB1_deficient tumors, suggesting therapies targeting mTOR may be relevant for tumors with STK11 alterations.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04337463", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03334617", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02664935", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04250545", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03065062", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02159989", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03017833", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03430882", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Blood Tumor Mutational Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "00", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "00"}}, "Interpretation": "Blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations from circulating tumor DNA in blood.

High bTMB levels were not detected in this sample. It is unclear whether the bTMB levels in this sample would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Depending on the clinical context, TMB testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. NSCLC harbors a median bTMB of 16.8 Muts/Mb (range 1.9_52.5 Muts/Mb)(Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950). Retrospective analysis of the Phase 3 OAK and Phase 2 POPLAR trials for patients with advanced or metastatic non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) reported that bTMB \u22657 Muts/Mb was associated with shorter PFS (2.8 vs. 4.2 months) and OS (7.4 vs. 11.9 months) compared with bTMB <7 Muts/Mb for patients treated with docetaxel (Nie et al., 2020; 32380463). In one study of advanced NSCLC in China, bTMB \u22656 Muts/Mb was associated with decreased PFS (10 vs. 18 months) and OS (11 vs. 25 months) compared with bTMB <6 Muts/Mb for patients treated with platinum_based chemotherapy (Ma et al., 2021; 34055609). A large study of Chinese patients with lung adenocarcinoma reported a shorter median OS for tumors with a higher number of mutations in a limited gene set compared with a lower mutation number (48.4 vs. 61.0 months)(Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843). Another study of patients with NSCLC correlated elevated TMB with poorer prognosis and significantly associated lower TMB in combination with PD_L1 negative status with longer median survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). However, no significant prognostic association of TMB and/or PD_L1 status with survival has been reported in patients with lung SCC (Yu et al., 2019; 30253973, Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). On the basis of clinical evidence in NSCLC and HSNCC, increased bTMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511) and anti_PD_1 (Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074) therapies. In NSCLC, multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 to 16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). In HNSCC, a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "MLL2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Q3910_Q3911del", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Q3910_Q3911del"}}, "Interpretation": "MLL2 encodes an H3K4_specific histone methyltransferase that is involved in the transcriptional response to progesterone signaling (Vicent et al., 2011; 21447625). Germline de novo mutations of MLL2 are responsible for the majority of cases of Kabuki syndrome, a complex and phenotypically distinctive developmental disorder (Hannibal et al., 2011; 21671394). A significant number of inactivating MLL2 alterations have been observed in multiple tumor types, suggesting a tumor suppressor role (Fagan et al.,2019; 31128216). MLL2 alterations are observed in a number of solid tumor contexts (COSMIC, Jan 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878), and are especially prevalent in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2012; 22960745) and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) (Augert et al., 2017; 28007623). MLL2 mutation was found to be an independent prognostic factor of poor PFS and OS in non_small cell lung cancer, but not in SCLC (Ardeshir_Larijani et al., 2018; 29627316). One study reported that MLL2 truncating mutations were more common in recurrent ovary granulosa cell tumors (GCT) compared with primary GCTs (24% [10/42] vs. 3.0% [1/32])(Hillman et al., 2018; 29950560). In a study of esophageal SCC, high MLL2 expression positively correlated with tumor stage, differentiation, and size, and negatively correlated with OS (Abudureheman et al., 2018; 29532228). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in MLL2. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors may detect nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "MUTYH", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "R19*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "R19*"}}, "Interpretation": "MUTYH (also known as MYH) encodes an enzyme involved in DNA base excision repair, and loss of function mutations in MUTYH result in increased rates of mutagenesis and promotion of tumorigenesis (David et al., 2007; 17581577). The two most frequently reported MUTYH loss of function mutations are G382D (also referred to as G396D) and Y165C (also referred to as Y179C) (Molatore et al., 2010; 19953527, Kundu et al., 2009; 19836313, D Agostino et al., 2010; 20418187, Hegde et al., 2014; 24310308, Aretz et al., 2013; 22872101). Numerous other MUTYH mutations have also been shown to result in loss of function (Molatore et al., 2010; 19953527, Kundu et al., 2009; 19836313, Ali et al., 2008; 18534194, D Agostino et al., 2010; 20418187). In general, somatic MUTYH mutations are infrequently reported across cancer types (COSMIC, 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Monoallelic MUTYH mutation occurs in 1_2% of the general population (Hegde et al., 2014; 24310308, Aretz et al., 2013; 22872101). There is conflicting data regarding the impact of monoallelic mutations on the risk of developing CRC (Win et al., 2014; 24444654, Lubbe et al., 2009; 19620482, Jones et al., 2009; 19394335). Patients with MUTYH_mutant CRC were reported to have significantly improved overall survival compared to patients without MUTYH mutation (Nielsen et al., 2010; 21044966). There are no therapies or clinical trials available to address MUTYH alterations in cancer. One or more of the MUTYH variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with MUTYH_associated polyposis (ClinVar, Sep 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline biallelic MUTYH mutation causes MUTYH_associated polyposis (also known as MYH_associated polyposis or MAP), an autosomal recessive condition characterized by multiple colorectal adenomas and increased lifetime risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) (Hegde et al., 2014; 24310308, Sampson et al., 2003; 12853198, Sieber et al., 2003; 12606733, Al_Tassan et al., 2002; 11818965). MAP accounts for approximately 0.7% of all CRC cases and 2% of early_onset CRC cases (Hegde et al., 2014; 24310308). In contrast to CRC, the role of MUTYH mutation in the context of other cancer types is not well established (Rennert et al., 2012; 21952991, Zhang et al., 2006; 16492928, von der Th\u00fcsen et al., 2011; 21189386, Casper et al., 2014; 24420788, Smith et al., 2009; 20110747). Estimates for the prevalence of MAP in the general population range from 1:5,000_1:10,000 (Aretz et al., 2013; 22872101). Therefore, in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of MUTYH is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Cannot Be Determined", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Cannot Be Determined"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI_H is generally infrequent in NSCLC, reported in fewer than 1% of samples across several large studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197, Ninomiya et al., 2006; 16641899, Vanderwalde et al., 2018; 29436178, Zang et al., 2019; 31270941, Dudley et al., 2016; 26880610, Takamochi et al., 2017; 28676214, Schrock et al., 2017; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2016.11.487), whereas data on the reported incidence of MSI_H in SCLC has been limited and conflicting (Pylkkanen et al., 1997; 9329646, Gonzalez et al., 2000; 11061602, Chen et al., 1996; 8782463, Merlo et al., 1994; 8174113). One study reported MSI_H in lung adenocarcinoma patients with smoking history, and 3 of 4 MSI_H patients examined also had metachronous carcinomas in other organs, although this has not been investigated in large scale studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of MSI in NSCLC are limited (PubMed, Oct 2021). On the basis of prospective clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD_1_targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143) and PD_L1_targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92). As the MSI status of this tumor is unknown, the relevance of these therapeutic approaches is unclear. While approximately 80% of MSI_H tumors arise due to somatic inactivation of an MMR pathway protein, about 20% arise due to germline mutations in one of the MMR genes (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942), which are associated with a condition known as Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC) (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756). Lynch syndrome leads to an increased risk of colorectal, endometrial, gastric, and other cancers (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756, Pande et al., 2012; 22714864, Kastrinos and Syngal, 2007; 17920897) and has an estimated prevalence in the general population ranging from 1:600 to 1:2000 (Silva et al., 2009; 19466295, Sehgal et al., 2014; 24978665, de la Chapelle et al., 2005; 16136383). Therefore, in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "SMAD4", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Q366*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Q366*"}}, "Interpretation": "SMAD4, also known as DPC4, encodes a tumor suppressor that regulates transcriptional activity downstream of TGF_beta receptor signaling (Massague et al., 2012; 22992590, Massague et al., 2008; 18662538). SMAD4 alterations that result in loss or disruption of the MH1 domain (aa 18_142), MH2 domain (aa 323_552), or SAD domain (aa 275_320) are predicted to be inactivating (Massague et al., 2005; 16322555, Mor\u00e9n et al., 2000; 10980615, Xu and Attisano, 2000; 10781087, Luo et al., 1999; 10485843, Jones and Kern, 2000; 10871368, Fink et al., 2001; 11196171, De Bosscher et al., 2004; 14715079, Shi et al., 1997; 9214508, Miyaki et al., 1999; 10340381, Prokova et al., 2007; 17994767, Wu et al., 2001; 11274206, Ding et al., 2009; 19139564, Kuang et al., 2004; 14647410, Watanabe et al., 2000; 11265759, Bosscher et al., 2004; 14715079). SMAD4 mutation or homozygous deletion is most frequently observed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (43%)(cBio_Witkiewicz et al., 2015; 25855536), pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (Jiao et al., 2014; 24293293), cholangiocarcinoma (25%)(Churi et al., 2014; 25536104), appendiceal adenocarcinoma (14_20% mutation; 57% deletion)(Liu et al., 2014; 24821835, Maru et al., 2004; 14647445), colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC; 14%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696), esophageal adenocarcinoma (14%)(Wang et al., 2015; 26336083), and stomach adenocarcinoma (13%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317). In preclinical studies, SMAD4 loss of function has been implicated in the development of mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas, including mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN)(Izeradjene et al., 2007; 17349581) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN)(Bardeesy et al., 2006; 17114584); in clinical samples, SMAD4 homozygous deletion has been observed in 10% of IPMNs and 8% of MCNs, and mutation was also observed in 5% of IPMNs (Springer et al., 2015; 26253305). SMAD4 gene alterations have been associated with reduced overall survival for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Blackford et al., 2009; 19584151). Reduced SMAD4 expression has been associated with worse prognosis in various cancer types, including CRC (Yan et al., 2016; 26861460, Kozak et al., 2015; 25681512, Roth et al., 2012; 23104212), appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (Davison et al., 2014; 24618609), gastric adenocarcinoma (Kim et al., 2004; 15033661, Xiangming et al., 2001; 11234879), esophageal adenocarcinoma (Singhi et al., 2015; 25634752), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Natsugoe et al., 2002; 12060625), breast cancer (de Kruijf et al., 2013; 23022998), and prostate cancer (Shipitsin et al., 2014; 25032733). There are no therapies to address SMAD4 alterations in cancer. Preclinical studies (Cui et al., 2012; 22753594, Haeger et al., 2016; 25893305) and a clinical study of pancreatic cancer suggest that low SMAD4 expression exhibit increased responsiveness to chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin and irinotecan (Bachet et al., 2012; 22377565). One or more of the SMAD4 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with juvenile polyposis syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline SMAD4 mutations, including those at the R361 hotspot, have been observed in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome (Houlston et al., 1998; 9811934, Woodford_Richens et al., 2000; 10764709, Howe et al., 2004; 15235019, Howe et al., 2004; 15235019, Howe et al., 2004; 15235019), which is associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal cancers (Brosens et al., 2011; 22171123). The penetrance of deleterious SMAD4 mutations in patients with colon cancer is estimated at 20% by age 35 and 70% by age 65 (Kalia et al., 2017; 27854360). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of SMAD4 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "V73fs*76", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "V73fs*76"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 is one of the most commonly mutated genes in lung cancer; mutations have been reported in 43_80% of non_small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745, Mogi and Kuwano, 2011; 21331359, Tekpli et al., 2013; 23011884, Vignot et al., 2013; 23630207, Maeng et al., 2013; 24222160, Cortot et al., 2014; 24169260, Itakura et al., 2013; 23922113), including 42_52% of lung adenocarcinomas and 58_83% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (cBioPortal, COSMIC, Feb 2021)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, cBio_Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745, Kim et al., 2014; 24323028). TP53 homozygous deletion has been observed in 1.4% of lung adenocarcinoma and <1% of lung squamous cell carcinoma cases (cBioPortal, Feb 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). In one study of 55 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, TP53 alterations correlated with immunogenic features including PD_L1 expression, tumor mutation burden and neoantigen presentation; likely as a consequence of this association TP53 mutations correlated with improved clinical outcomes to PD_1 inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab in this study (Dong et al., 2016; 28039262). Mutations in TP53 have been associated with lymph node metastasis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (Seo et al., 2012; 22975805). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% (17/176) and SDs in 53.4% (94/176) of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21.1% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12.1% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wild_type (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 31.9% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73.4% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 42.9% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76.2% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24.0% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71.4% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75.0% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Additionally, the combination of a CHK1 inhibitor and irinotecan reportedly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival in a TP53_mutated, but not TP53_wild_type, breast cancer xenotransplant mouse model (Ma et al., 2012; 22446188). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Fraction", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction Not Detected", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction Not Detected"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor fraction provides an estimate of the percentage of ctDNA present in a cell_free DNA (cfDNA) sample. The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with elevated tumor fraction values have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus high sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at low risk of false negative results. However, if elevated tumor fraction is not detected, it does not exclude the presence of disease burden or compromise the confidence of reported alterations. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels. In the research setting, changes in tumor fraction estimates have been associated with treatment duration and clinical response and may be a useful indicator for future cancer management (Bronkhorst et al., 2019; 30923679, Raja et al., 2018; 30093454, Hrebien et al., 2019; 30860573, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5039, Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Goodall et al., 2017; 28450425, Goldberg et al., 2018; 29330207).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "KEAP1", "Alteration": "L373fs*27", "Title": "KEAPSAKE: A Study of Telaglenastat (CB_839) With Standard_of_Care Chemoimmunotherapy in 1L KEAP1/NRF2_Mutated, Nonsquamous NSCLC", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "PD_1, GLS", "Locations": "Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, California, Utah", "NCTID": "NCT04265534", "Note": "KEAP1 inactivation may predict sensitivity to glutaminase inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "KEAP1", "Alteration": "L373fs*27", "Title": "Testing Whether Cancers With Specific Mutations Respond Better to Glutaminase Inhibitor, CB_839 HCl, Anti_Cancer Treatment, BeGIN Study", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "GLS", "Locations": "Kansas, Missouri, Illinois", "NCTID": "NCT03872427", "Note": "KEAP1 inactivation may predict sensitivity to glutaminase inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "KEAP1", "Alteration": "L373fs*27", "Title": "Testing of the Anti Cancer Drugs CB_839 HCl (Telaglenastat) and MLN0128 (Sapanisertib) in Advanced Stage Non_small Cell Lung Cancer", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "mTORC1, mTORC2, GLS", "Locations": "California, New York", "NCTID": "NCT04250545", "Note": "KEAP1 inactivation may predict sensitivity to glutaminase inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "KRAS", "Alteration": "G12C", "Title": "A Study Of Multiple Immunotherapy_Based Treatment Combinations In Participants With Metastatic Non_Small Cell Lung Cancer (Morpheus_ Non_Small Cell Lung Cancer)", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1/2", "Target": "PD_L1, MEK, CEA, CXCR4, EZH2, MDM2, ADORA2A", "Locations": "Tainan City (Taiwan), Jeollanam_do (Korea, Republic of), Seoul (Korea, Republic of), Blacktown (Australia), East Melbourne (Australia), Haifa (Israel), Petach Tikva (Israel), Ramat Gan (Israel), Newcastle upon Tyne (United Kingdom), Dijon (France)", "NCTID": "NCT03337698", "Note": "Clinical evidence suggests that patients with the KRAS G12C mutation may be sensitive to G12C_targeted inhibitors such as sotorasib and adagrasib.
