In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). Amplification of EGFR has been associated with increased expression of EGFR mRNA and protein in several cancer types (Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Bhargava et al., 2005; 15920544, Yang et al., 2012; 22490401). A mutation of the EGFR gene, referred to as EGFRvIII, results from a gene rearrangement that deletes exons 2_7. This alteration causes an in_frame deletion of 801 base pairs encoding part of the extracellular ligand_binding domain (Nishikawa et al., 1994; 8052651). This deletion has shown to result in ligand_independent (constitutive) phosphorylation and activation of EGFR, as well as consequent tumorigenesis (Nishikawa et al., 1994; 8052651, Nedergaard et al., 2012; 22385404). EGFR mutations that have been characterized in biochemical assays to be activating, as observed here, are predicted to confer sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies (Foster et al., 2010; 20942962, Cai et al., 2008; 18193092, Stabile et al., 2005; 15735034, Zhang et al., 2006; 17409930, Siegfried et al., 2012; 22258476, ManChon et al., 2014; 24743239, Cho et al., 2014; 24894453, Hama et al., 2009; 19726454, Tam et al., 2009; 19671738, Kancha et al., 2009; 19147750, Chen et al., 2006; 16205628, Lee et al., 2006; 17177598, Ymer et al., 2011; 24212795, Razis et al., 2009; 19789313, Wang et al., 2011; 21532887, Cai et al., 2008; 18193092, Kim et al., 2019; 31290142, Sueangoen et al., 2020; 32190291, Lundby et al., 2019; 31585087). The EGFR A289V mutation, located in the extracellular domain, has been shown to be activating (Lee et al., 2006; 17177598). Glioblastoma cell lines harboring an EGFR A289V or A289D mutation were shown to be dependent on EGFR kinase activity (Vivanco et al., 2012; 22588883), and other mutations at this position are also likely activating. In addition, A289V is frequently associated with increased EGFR gene copy number (Lee et al., 2006; 17177598). Across several genomic studies of CNS tumors, EGFR amplification has been reported in 16.9% of anaplastic astrocytomas, and 39.7% of glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs)(Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031, Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509). Across several genomic studies of CNS tumors, EGFR alterations have been reported in 13.2% of anaplastic astrocytomas, 5.3_15.9% of glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs), and 0% of pilocytic astrocytomas (cbio_Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031, cbio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, cbio_Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, cbio_Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509). In the glioblastoma (GBM) TCGA dataset, putative high_level amplification of EGFR has been found in 48% of cases and mutation has been found in 21% of cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). Missense mutations in the EGFR extracellular domain have been found in 10_15% of GBMs and approximately half have a low_level amplification of the mutated allele (Lee et al., 2006; 17177598, Vivanco et al., 2012; 22588883). One study detected EGFR alterations in 50% (117/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed, including 41% (95/232) with a co_occurring EGFR amplification and mutation, 26% (61/232) with an EGFR domain truncation event, such as EGFRvIII, and 2.2% (5/232) with an EGFR fusion event (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). The EGFRvIII mutation has been variously reported in 6_46% of GBM samples (Nishikawa et al., 1994; 8052651, Shinojima et al., 2003; 14583498, Nishikawa et al., 2004; 15700833, Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176, Viana_Pereira et al., 2008; 18507036, Yoshimoto et al., 2008; 18223223, Larysz et al., 2011; 21455841, Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251, Lv et al., 2012; 22752145). No definitive correlation has been identified between EGFR amplification and length of survival in patients with GBM (Srividya et al., 2010; 20702468, Das et al., 2011; 20888234); however, EGFR amplification has been associated with prolonged survival in patients over the age of 60 with GBM (Smith et al., 2001; 11504770). The link between EGFRvIII status and prognosis is unclear, although some studies suggest that it may be linked to improved survival and response to chemotherapy (Montano et al., 2011; 22241957). In multiple glioblastoma (GBM) studies, the presence of EGFRvIII has not predicted clinical benefit from first_generation EGFR TKIs such as erlotinib (Van den Bent et al., 2009; 19204207, Haas_Kogen et al., 2005; 15956649, Brown et al., 2008; 18955445, Preusser et al., 2008; 18458820, Wen et al., 2014; 24470557, Gallego et al., 2013; 24352766) or gefitinib (Rich et al. 2004; 14638850, Uhm et al., 2011; 20510539, Preusser et al., 2008; 18458820). However, case reports have described patients with EGFRvIII_positive GBM responding to erlotinib (Doyle et al., 2018; 30410775, D Alessandris et al., 2013; 23132371, Custodio and Perez_Segura, 2010; 20462843, D Alessandris et al., 2018; 30306271). In a retrospective study of patients with GBM treated with erlotinib or gefitinib, co_expression of EGFRvIII with PTEN protein was the strongest predictor of response (P<0.001)(Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176), suggesting that activity in this setting is dependent on PTEN status (Mellinghoff et al., 2007; 17255257, Arif et al., 2018; 29492119). However, a prospective Phase 2 trial testing erlotinib monotherapy for patients with EGFRvIII and PTEN_positive recurrent glioblastoma reported minimal efficacy and was terminated (Gallego et al., 2013; 24352766). The second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib have shown minimal efficacy for patients with EGFRvIII glioblastoma (GBM)(Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Alshami et al., 2015; 26423602, Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). A Phase 1/2 study of afatinib, temozolomide, or the combination for patients with GBM reported clinical benefit, including for patients with EGFRvIII; however, temozolomide alone and in combination exhibited better responses than afatinib monotherapy (Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Alshami et al., 2015; 26423602). A Phase 2 trial of dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified GBM reported a DCR of 26% (5/19) among patients with EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII; however, the trial failed to meet its primary endpoint of 6_month PFS (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464). A retrospective biomarker analysis of another Phase 2 study of dacomitinib for patients with GBM found no association between EGFRvIII and clinical benefit (Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). A patient with multiple glioblastoma (GBM) tumors, one of which harbored EGFRvIII, experienced progression of the EGFRvIII_positive tumor during treatment with osimertinib (Makhlin et al., 2019; 31769726). Novel approaches that specifically target EGFRvIII in glioblastoma (GBM), such as the vaccine rindopepimut, are under investigation in both clinical and preclinical studies. A Phase 2 trial reported significant improvement in OS for patients with EGFRvIII_positive GBM with rindopepimut in combination with bevacizumab compared to bevacizumab alone (HR=0.53, p=0.01)(Reardon et al., 2020; 32034072). However, a Phase 3 study of rindopepimut combined with temozolomide compared to temozolomide alone in newly diagnosed EGFRvIII_positive GBM patients was terminated after the interim analysis, due to a lack of clinical benefit as measured by OS (20 vs. 20 months)(Weller et al., 2017; 28844499). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer, EGFR activating mutations may predict sensitivity to EGFR TKIs, including erlotinib (Rosell et al., 2011; 22285168), gefitinib (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064), afatinib (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960), dacomitinib (Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), and osimertinib (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549); however, the data for patients with other tumor types are limited (Hong et al., 2020; 32749686, Kim et al., 2015; 26462025, Kim et al., 2015; 25424851, Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840, Cavalieri et al., 2018; 29734047, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Audet et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 6041). A case study of a patient with multiple glioblastoma (GBM) tumors, one of which harbored EGFR amplification and multiple missense mutations, reported a near_CR of the EGFR_amplified and _mutated tumor to osimertinib (Makhlin et al., 2019; 31769726). A case series of 11 patients with bithalamic gliomas with EGFR mutations suggested that treatment with EGFR inhibitors, including osimertinib, prolonged patient survival relative to other types of treatment; however, no patients attained PR or SD (Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840). Clinical studies of the second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified gliomas have shown limited efficacy (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Blumenthal et al., 2016; 27531351); however, a small subset of patients has experienced clinical benefit (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). Multiple studies have failed to find a positive association between increased EGFR expression and clinical benefit from erlotinib or gefitinib for patients with glioblastoma (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176, Franceschi et al., 2007; 17353924, Chakravarti et al., 2013; 23182702, Hegi et al., 2011; 21471286, Rich et al. 2004; 14638850). There are conflicting data on the efficacy of anti_EGFR antibodies for the treatment of EGFR_amplified tumors. A meta_analysis of colorectal cancer patients treated with second_line or higher cetuximab or panitumumab observed an association between EGFR copy number gain and increased OS and PFS (Jiang et al., 2013; 23441167). However, studies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cancer found either no association or a negative association between EGFR copy number gain and survival after treatment with first_line cetuximab or panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy (Licitra et al., 2011; 21048039, Smyth et al., 2020; 33199443). The Phase 3 INTELLANCE trial of depatuxizumab mafodotin (ABT_414), an EGFR_targeted antibody_drug conjugate with a toxic payload, in patients with EGFR_amplified glioblastoma (GBM) was stopped for futility. Interim analysis demonstrated improved median PFS (mPFS) of ABT_414 monotherapy compared with placebo (HR=0.84); however, no OS benefit was observed (HR=1.01). Improved mPFS was also observed in patients harboring EGFRvIII (HR=0.73) but without an OS improvement (HR=0.95) (Lassman et al., 2019; Neuro_Oncology Abstract ACTR_21). The Phase 2 INTELLANCE trial demonstrated clinical benefit for EGFR_amplified GBM for the combination of ABT_414, temozolomide, and radiotherapy (HR=0.66, p=0.017), but there was no evidence of efficacy for ABT_414 monotherapy (HR=1.04, p=0.83)(Bent et al., 2020; 31747009).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

For patients with esophageal or biliary cancer treated with erlotinib or gefitinib, elevated EGFR copy number or amplification is associated with clinical responses and longer survival (Petty et al., 2017; 28537764, Philip et al., 2006; 16809731, Xie et al., 2020; 32958820, Luo et al., 2020; 33026449, Lee et al., 2012; 22192731). Patients with refractory advanced esophageal carcinoma and EGFR amplification derived significant overall survival benefit from gefitinib compared to placebo (HR = 0.21)(Petty et al., 2017; 28537764, Dutton et al., 2014; 24950987). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> A clinical study of patients with glioblastoma (GBM) treated with gefitinib or erlotinib found that 9/49 (18%) had tumor shrinkage of 25% or more; in this study, the extracellular domain EGFRvIII mutation was correlated with response (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176).

However, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of gefitinib combined with radiotherapy in 178 patients with GBM reported no overall survival benefit of added gefitinib, and EGFR expression was found to be of no prognostic value for patients treated with gefitinib plus radiotherapy (Chakravarti et al., 2013; 23182702). A Phase 2 trial of preoperative gefitinib treatment in patients with recurrent GBM reported that although EGFR phosphorylation was decreased in treated patients as compared to the control group, measurement of 12 downstream molecules revealed no significant changes (Hegi et al., 2011; 21471286). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Panitumumab", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Panitumumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets EGFR.

For patients with activating mutations in EGFR, treatment with erlotinib has been associated with improved response and lengthened time to progression (Cappuzzo et al., 2010; 20493771, Rosell et al., 2012; 22285168, Zhong et al., 2019; 31194613, Petrelli et al., 2011; 22056888). For patients with esophageal or biliary cancer treated with erlotinib or gefitinib, elevated EGFR copy number or amplification is associated with clinical responses and longer survival (Petty et al., 2017; 28537764, Philip et al., 2006; 16809731, Xie et al., 2020; 32958820, Luo et al., 2020; 33026449, Lee et al., 2012; 22192731). Responses to erlotinib have been reported for patients with EGFR rearrangements (Konduri et al., 2016; 27102076, Zhu et al., 2018; 29290255, Wang et al., 2018; 30255937, Baik et al., 2015; 26398831, Xu et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract e13538). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> In the MyPathway Phase 2a basket study for advanced solid tumors, 1 of 9 patients with EGFR activation mutations responded to erlotinib monotherapy; the responding patient had urethral adenocarcinoma (Hainsworth et al., 2018; 29320312). A patient with EGFR_mutated metastatic lacrimal gland adenoid cystic carcinoma experienced clinical benefit from erlotinib treatment that was ongoing at 14 months (Nie et al., 2018; 29998897). A clinical study of patients with glioblastoma (GBM) treated with gefitinib or erlotinib found that 9/49 (18%) had tumor shrinkage of 25% or more; in this study, the extracellular domain EGFRvIII mutation was correlated with response (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176). In a Phase 2 study of 65 patients with GBM or gliosarcoma, treatment with erlotinib, temozolomide, and radiotherapy resulted in longer progression_free survival relative to a historical control study utilizing a regimen of temozolomide and radiotherapy alone (19.3 months vs. 14.1 months)(Prados et al., 2009; 19075262). However, in a Phase 1/2 trial of erlotinib monotherapy in 11 patients with relapsed or refractory GBM or anaplastic astrocytoma, all patients showed disease progression and the drug showed significant toxicity (Kesavabhotla et al., 2012; 22946346). In addition, a Phase 2 trial of patients with recurrent or progressive GBM treated with erlotinib and sorafenib did not meet its objective of a 30% increase in overall survival time compared with historical controls; sorafenib was found to increase erlotinib clearance (Peereboom et al., 2013; 23328813). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT03239015", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03810872", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03618667", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04172597", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02800486", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02861898", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03783403", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02451553", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03829436", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02303678", "Include": "true"}]}}, {"Name": "A289T", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "A289T"}}, "Interpretation": "EGFR encodes the epidermal growth factor receptor, which belongs to a class of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases. In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). Amplification of EGFR has been associated with increased expression of EGFR mRNA and protein in several cancer types (Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Bhargava et al., 2005; 15920544, Yang et al., 2012; 22490401). A mutation of the EGFR gene, referred to as EGFRvIII, results from a gene rearrangement that deletes exons 2_7. This alteration causes an in_frame deletion of 801 base pairs encoding part of the extracellular ligand_binding domain (Nishikawa et al., 1994; 8052651). This deletion has shown to result in ligand_independent (constitutive) phosphorylation and activation of EGFR, as well as consequent tumorigenesis (Nishikawa et al., 1994; 8052651, Nedergaard et al., 2012; 22385404). EGFR mutations that have been characterized in biochemical assays to be activating, as observed here, are predicted to confer sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies (Foster et al., 2010; 20942962, Cai et al., 2008; 18193092, Stabile et al., 2005; 15735034, Zhang et al., 2006; 17409930, Siegfried et al., 2012; 22258476, ManChon et al., 2014; 24743239, Cho et al., 2014; 24894453, Hama et al., 2009; 19726454, Tam et al., 2009; 19671738, Kancha et al., 2009; 19147750, Chen et al., 2006; 16205628, Lee et al., 2006; 17177598, Ymer et al., 2011; 24212795, Razis et al., 2009; 19789313, Wang et al., 2011; 21532887, Cai et al., 2008; 18193092, Kim et al., 2019; 31290142, Sueangoen et al., 2020; 32190291, Lundby et al., 2019; 31585087). The EGFR A289V mutation, located in the extracellular domain, has been shown to be activating (Lee et al., 2006; 17177598). Glioblastoma cell lines harboring an EGFR A289V or A289D mutation were shown to be dependent on EGFR kinase activity (Vivanco et al., 2012; 22588883), and other mutations at this position are also likely activating. In addition, A289V is frequently associated with increased EGFR gene copy number (Lee et al., 2006; 17177598). Across several genomic studies of CNS tumors, EGFR amplification has been reported in 16.9% of anaplastic astrocytomas, and 39.7% of glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs)(Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031, Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509). Across several genomic studies of CNS tumors, EGFR alterations have been reported in 13.2% of anaplastic astrocytomas, 5.3_15.9% of glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs), and 0% of pilocytic astrocytomas (cbio_Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031, cbio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, cbio_Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, cbio_Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509). In the glioblastoma (GBM) TCGA dataset, putative high_level amplification of EGFR has been found in 48% of cases and mutation has been found in 21% of cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). Missense mutations in the EGFR extracellular domain have been found in 10_15% of GBMs and approximately half have a low_level amplification of the mutated allele (Lee et al., 2006; 17177598, Vivanco et al., 2012; 22588883). One study detected EGFR alterations in 50% (117/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed, including 41% (95/232) with a co_occurring EGFR amplification and mutation, 26% (61/232) with an EGFR domain truncation event, such as EGFRvIII, and 2.2% (5/232) with an EGFR fusion event (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). The EGFRvIII mutation has been variously reported in 6_46% of GBM samples (Nishikawa et al., 1994; 8052651, Shinojima et al., 2003; 14583498, Nishikawa et al., 2004; 15700833, Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176, Viana_Pereira et al., 2008; 18507036, Yoshimoto et al., 2008; 18223223, Larysz et al., 2011; 21455841, Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251, Lv et al., 2012; 22752145). No definitive correlation has been identified between EGFR amplification and length of survival in patients with GBM (Srividya et al., 2010; 20702468, Das et al., 2011; 20888234); however, EGFR amplification has been associated with prolonged survival in patients over the age of 60 with GBM (Smith et al., 2001; 11504770). The link between EGFRvIII status and prognosis is unclear, although some studies suggest that it may be linked to improved survival and response to chemotherapy (Montano et al., 2011; 22241957). In multiple glioblastoma (GBM) studies, the presence of EGFRvIII has not predicted clinical benefit from first_generation EGFR TKIs such as erlotinib (Van den Bent et al., 2009; 19204207, Haas_Kogen et al., 2005; 15956649, Brown et al., 2008; 18955445, Preusser et al., 2008; 18458820, Wen et al., 2014; 24470557, Gallego et al., 2013; 24352766) or gefitinib (Rich et al. 2004; 14638850, Uhm et al., 2011; 20510539, Preusser et al., 2008; 18458820). However, case reports have described patients with EGFRvIII_positive GBM responding to erlotinib (Doyle et al., 2018; 30410775, D Alessandris et al., 2013; 23132371, Custodio and Perez_Segura, 2010; 20462843, D Alessandris et al., 2018; 30306271). In a retrospective study of patients with GBM treated with erlotinib or gefitinib, co_expression of EGFRvIII with PTEN protein was the strongest predictor of response (P<0.001)(Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176), suggesting that activity in this setting is dependent on PTEN status (Mellinghoff et al., 2007; 17255257, Arif et al., 2018; 29492119). However, a prospective Phase 2 trial testing erlotinib monotherapy for patients with EGFRvIII and PTEN_positive recurrent glioblastoma reported minimal efficacy and was terminated (Gallego et al., 2013; 24352766). The second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib have shown minimal efficacy for patients with EGFRvIII glioblastoma (GBM)(Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Alshami et al., 2015; 26423602, Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). A Phase 1/2 study of afatinib, temozolomide, or the combination for patients with GBM reported clinical benefit, including for patients with EGFRvIII; however, temozolomide alone and in combination exhibited better responses than afatinib monotherapy (Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Alshami et al., 2015; 26423602). A Phase 2 trial of dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified GBM reported a DCR of 26% (5/19) among patients with EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII; however, the trial failed to meet its primary endpoint of 6_month PFS (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464). A retrospective biomarker analysis of another Phase 2 study of dacomitinib for patients with GBM found no association between EGFRvIII and clinical benefit (Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). A patient with multiple glioblastoma (GBM) tumors, one of which harbored EGFRvIII, experienced progression of the EGFRvIII_positive tumor during treatment with osimertinib (Makhlin et al., 2019; 31769726). Novel approaches that specifically target EGFRvIII in glioblastoma (GBM), such as the vaccine rindopepimut, are under investigation in both clinical and preclinical studies. A Phase 2 trial reported significant improvement in OS for patients with EGFRvIII_positive GBM with rindopepimut in combination with bevacizumab compared to bevacizumab alone (HR=0.53, p=0.01)(Reardon et al., 2020; 32034072). However, a Phase 3 study of rindopepimut combined with temozolomide compared to temozolomide alone in newly diagnosed EGFRvIII_positive GBM patients was terminated after the interim analysis, due to a lack of clinical benefit as measured by OS (20 vs. 20 months)(Weller et al., 2017; 28844499). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer, EGFR activating mutations may predict sensitivity to EGFR TKIs, including erlotinib (Rosell et al., 2011; 22285168), gefitinib (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064), afatinib (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960), dacomitinib (Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), and osimertinib (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549); however, the data for patients with other tumor types are limited (Hong et al., 2020; 32749686, Kim et al., 2015; 26462025, Kim et al., 2015; 25424851, Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840, Cavalieri et al., 2018; 29734047, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Audet et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 6041). A case study of a patient with multiple glioblastoma (GBM) tumors, one of which harbored EGFR amplification and multiple missense mutations, reported a near_CR of the EGFR_amplified and _mutated tumor to osimertinib (Makhlin et al., 2019; 31769726). A case series of 11 patients with bithalamic gliomas with EGFR mutations suggested that treatment with EGFR inhibitors, including osimertinib, prolonged patient survival relative to other types of treatment; however, no patients attained PR or SD (Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840). Clinical studies of the second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified gliomas have shown limited efficacy (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Blumenthal et al., 2016; 27531351); however, a small subset of patients has experienced clinical benefit (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). Multiple studies have failed to find a positive association between increased EGFR expression and clinical benefit from erlotinib or gefitinib for patients with glioblastoma (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176, Franceschi et al., 2007; 17353924, Chakravarti et al., 2013; 23182702, Hegi et al., 2011; 21471286, Rich et al. 2004; 14638850). There are conflicting data on the efficacy of anti_EGFR antibodies for the treatment of EGFR_amplified tumors. A meta_analysis of colorectal cancer patients treated with second_line or higher cetuximab or panitumumab observed an association between EGFR copy number gain and increased OS and PFS (Jiang et al., 2013; 23441167). However, studies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cancer found either no association or a negative association between EGFR copy number gain and survival after treatment with first_line cetuximab or panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy (Licitra et al., 2011; 21048039, Smyth et al., 2020; 33199443). The Phase 3 INTELLANCE trial of depatuxizumab mafodotin (ABT_414), an EGFR_targeted antibody_drug conjugate with a toxic payload, in patients with EGFR_amplified glioblastoma (GBM) was stopped for futility. Interim analysis demonstrated improved median PFS (mPFS) of ABT_414 monotherapy compared with placebo (HR=0.84); however, no OS benefit was observed (HR=1.01). Improved mPFS was also observed in patients harboring EGFRvIII (HR=0.73) but without an OS improvement (HR=0.95) (Lassman et al., 2019; Neuro_Oncology Abstract ACTR_21). The Phase 2 INTELLANCE trial demonstrated clinical benefit for EGFR_amplified GBM for the combination of ABT_414, temozolomide, and radiotherapy (HR=0.66, p=0.017), but there was no evidence of efficacy for ABT_414 monotherapy (HR=1.04, p=0.83)(Bent et al., 2020; 31747009).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

However, another study demonstrated that in patients with GBM harboring EGFR amplification but lacking expression of the EGFRvIII variant, treatment with cetuximab resulted in significantly better progression_free survival (PFS) and numerical (although not statistically significant) improvement in overall survival (OS) (Lv et al., 2012; 22752145). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Erlotinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Erlotinib is a small_molecule inhibitor of EGFR.

For patients with activating mutations in EGFR, treatment with erlotinib has been associated with improved response and lengthened time to progression (Cappuzzo et al., 2010; 20493771, Rosell et al., 2012; 22285168, Zhong et al., 2019; 31194613, Petrelli et al., 2011; 22056888). For patients with esophageal or biliary cancer treated with erlotinib or gefitinib, elevated EGFR copy number or amplification is associated with clinical responses and longer survival (Petty et al., 2017; 28537764, Philip et al., 2006; 16809731, Xie et al., 2020; 32958820, Luo et al., 2020; 33026449, Lee et al., 2012; 22192731). Responses to erlotinib have been reported for patients with EGFR rearrangements (Konduri et al., 2016; 27102076, Zhu et al., 2018; 29290255, Wang et al., 2018; 30255937, Baik et al., 2015; 26398831, Xu et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract e13538). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> In the MyPathway Phase 2a basket study for advanced solid tumors, 1 of 9 patients with EGFR activation mutations responded to erlotinib monotherapy; the responding patient had urethral adenocarcinoma (Hainsworth et al., 2018; 29320312). A patient with EGFR_mutated metastatic lacrimal gland adenoid cystic carcinoma experienced clinical benefit from erlotinib treatment that was ongoing at 14 months (Nie et al., 2018; 29998897). A clinical study of patients with glioblastoma (GBM) treated with gefitinib or erlotinib found that 9/49 (18%) had tumor shrinkage of 25% or more; in this study, the extracellular domain EGFRvIII mutation was correlated with response (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176). In a Phase 2 study of 65 patients with GBM or gliosarcoma, treatment with erlotinib, temozolomide, and radiotherapy resulted in longer progression_free survival relative to a historical control study utilizing a regimen of temozolomide and radiotherapy alone (19.3 months vs. 14.1 months)(Prados et al., 2009; 19075262). However, in a Phase 1/2 trial of erlotinib monotherapy in 11 patients with relapsed or refractory GBM or anaplastic astrocytoma, all patients showed disease progression and the drug showed significant toxicity (Kesavabhotla et al., 2012; 22946346). In addition, a Phase 2 trial of patients with recurrent or progressive GBM treated with erlotinib and sorafenib did not meet its objective of a 30% increase in overall survival time compared with historical controls; sorafenib was found to increase erlotinib clearance (Peereboom et al., 2013; 23328813). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT03239015", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03810872", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03618667", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04172597", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02800486", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02861898", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03783403", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02451553", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03829436", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02303678", "Include": "true"}]}}, {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "EGFR encodes the epidermal growth factor receptor, which belongs to a class of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases. In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). Amplification of EGFR has been associated with increased expression of EGFR mRNA and protein in several cancer types (Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Bhargava et al., 2005; 15920544, Yang et al., 2012; 22490401). A mutation of the EGFR gene, referred to as EGFRvIII, results from a gene rearrangement that deletes exons 2_7. This alteration causes an in_frame deletion of 801 base pairs encoding part of the extracellular ligand_binding domain (Nishikawa et al., 1994; 8052651). This deletion has shown to result in ligand_independent (constitutive) phosphorylation and activation of EGFR, as well as consequent tumorigenesis (Nishikawa et al., 1994; 8052651, Nedergaard et al., 2012; 22385404). EGFR mutations that have been characterized in biochemical assays to be activating, as observed here, are predicted to confer sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies (Foster et al., 2010; 20942962, Cai et al., 2008; 18193092, Stabile et al., 2005; 15735034, Zhang et al., 2006; 17409930, Siegfried et al., 2012; 22258476, ManChon et al., 2014; 24743239, Cho et al., 2014; 24894453, Hama et al., 2009; 19726454, Tam et al., 2009; 19671738, Kancha et al., 2009; 19147750, Chen et al., 2006; 16205628, Lee et al., 2006; 17177598, Ymer et al., 2011; 24212795, Razis et al., 2009; 19789313, Wang et al., 2011; 21532887, Cai et al., 2008; 18193092, Kim et al., 2019; 31290142, Sueangoen et al., 2020; 32190291, Lundby et al., 2019; 31585087). The EGFR A289V mutation, located in the extracellular domain, has been shown to be activating (Lee et al., 2006; 17177598). Glioblastoma cell lines harboring an EGFR A289V or A289D mutation were shown to be dependent on EGFR kinase activity (Vivanco et al., 2012; 22588883), and other mutations at this position are also likely activating. In addition, A289V is frequently associated with increased EGFR gene copy number (Lee et al., 2006; 17177598). Across several genomic studies of CNS tumors, EGFR amplification has been reported in 16.9% of anaplastic astrocytomas, and 39.7% of glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs)(Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031, Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509). Across several genomic studies of CNS tumors, EGFR alterations have been reported in 13.2% of anaplastic astrocytomas, 5.3_15.9% of glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs), and 0% of pilocytic astrocytomas (cbio_Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031, cbio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, cbio_Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, cbio_Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509). In the glioblastoma (GBM) TCGA dataset, putative high_level amplification of EGFR has been found in 48% of cases and mutation has been found in 21% of cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). Missense mutations in the EGFR extracellular domain have been found in 10_15% of GBMs and approximately half have a low_level amplification of the mutated allele (Lee et al., 2006; 17177598, Vivanco et al., 2012; 22588883). One study detected EGFR alterations in 50% (117/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed, including 41% (95/232) with a co_occurring EGFR amplification and mutation, 26% (61/232) with an EGFR domain truncation event, such as EGFRvIII, and 2.2% (5/232) with an EGFR fusion event (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). The EGFRvIII mutation has been variously reported in 6_46% of GBM samples (Nishikawa et al., 1994; 8052651, Shinojima et al., 2003; 14583498, Nishikawa et al., 2004; 15700833, Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176, Viana_Pereira et al., 2008; 18507036, Yoshimoto et al., 2008; 18223223, Larysz et al., 2011; 21455841, Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251, Lv et al., 2012; 22752145). No definitive correlation has been identified between EGFR amplification and length of survival in patients with GBM (Srividya et al., 2010; 20702468, Das et al., 2011; 20888234); however, EGFR amplification has been associated with prolonged survival in patients over the age of 60 with GBM (Smith et al., 2001; 11504770). The link between EGFRvIII status and prognosis is unclear, although some studies suggest that it may be linked to improved survival and response to chemotherapy (Montano et al., 2011; 22241957). In multiple glioblastoma (GBM) studies, the presence of EGFRvIII has not predicted clinical benefit from first_generation EGFR TKIs such as erlotinib (Van den Bent et al., 2009; 19204207, Haas_Kogen et al., 2005; 15956649, Brown et al., 2008; 18955445, Preusser et al., 2008; 18458820, Wen et al., 2014; 24470557, Gallego et al., 2013; 24352766) or gefitinib (Rich et al. 2004; 14638850, Uhm et al., 2011; 20510539, Preusser et al., 2008; 18458820). However, case reports have described patients with EGFRvIII_positive GBM responding to erlotinib (Doyle et al., 2018; 30410775, D Alessandris et al., 2013; 23132371, Custodio and Perez_Segura, 2010; 20462843, D Alessandris et al., 2018; 30306271). In a retrospective study of patients with GBM treated with erlotinib or gefitinib, co_expression of EGFRvIII with PTEN protein was the strongest predictor of response (P<0.001)(Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176), suggesting that activity in this setting is dependent on PTEN status (Mellinghoff et al., 2007; 17255257, Arif et al., 2018; 29492119). However, a prospective Phase 2 trial testing erlotinib monotherapy for patients with EGFRvIII and PTEN_positive recurrent glioblastoma reported minimal efficacy and was terminated (Gallego et al., 2013; 24352766). The second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib have shown minimal efficacy for patients with EGFRvIII glioblastoma (GBM)(Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Alshami et al., 2015; 26423602, Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). A Phase 1/2 study of afatinib, temozolomide, or the combination for patients with GBM reported clinical benefit, including for patients with EGFRvIII; however, temozolomide alone and in combination exhibited better responses than afatinib monotherapy (Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Alshami et al., 2015; 26423602). A Phase 2 trial of dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified GBM reported a DCR of 26% (5/19) among patients with EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII; however, the trial failed to meet its primary endpoint of 6_month PFS (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464). A retrospective biomarker analysis of another Phase 2 study of dacomitinib for patients with GBM found no association between EGFRvIII and clinical benefit (Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). A patient with multiple glioblastoma (GBM) tumors, one of which harbored EGFRvIII, experienced progression of the EGFRvIII_positive tumor during treatment with osimertinib (Makhlin et al., 2019; 31769726). Novel approaches that specifically target EGFRvIII in glioblastoma (GBM), such as the vaccine rindopepimut, are under investigation in both clinical and preclinical studies. A Phase 2 trial reported significant improvement in OS for patients with EGFRvIII_positive GBM with rindopepimut in combination with bevacizumab compared to bevacizumab alone (HR=0.53, p=0.01)(Reardon et al., 2020; 32034072). However, a Phase 3 study of rindopepimut combined with temozolomide compared to temozolomide alone in newly diagnosed EGFRvIII_positive GBM patients was terminated after the interim analysis, due to a lack of clinical benefit as measured by OS (20 vs. 20 months)(Weller et al., 2017; 28844499). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer, EGFR activating mutations may predict sensitivity to EGFR TKIs, including erlotinib (Rosell et al., 2011; 22285168), gefitinib (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064), afatinib (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960), dacomitinib (Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), and osimertinib (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549); however, the data for patients with other tumor types are limited (Hong et al., 2020; 32749686, Kim et al., 2015; 26462025, Kim et al., 2015; 25424851, Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840, Cavalieri et al., 2018; 29734047, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Audet et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 6041). A case study of a patient with multiple glioblastoma (GBM) tumors, one of which harbored EGFR amplification and multiple missense mutations, reported a near_CR of the EGFR_amplified and _mutated tumor to osimertinib (Makhlin et al., 2019; 31769726). A case series of 11 patients with bithalamic gliomas with EGFR mutations suggested that treatment with EGFR inhibitors, including osimertinib, prolonged patient survival relative to other types of treatment; however, no patients attained PR or SD (Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840). Clinical studies of the second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified gliomas have shown limited efficacy (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Blumenthal et al., 2016; 27531351); however, a small subset of patients has experienced clinical benefit (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). Multiple studies have failed to find a positive association between increased EGFR expression and clinical benefit from erlotinib or gefitinib for patients with glioblastoma (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176, Franceschi et al., 2007; 17353924, Chakravarti et al., 2013; 23182702, Hegi et al., 2011; 21471286, Rich et al. 2004; 14638850). There are conflicting data on the efficacy of anti_EGFR antibodies for the treatment of EGFR_amplified tumors. A meta_analysis of colorectal cancer patients treated with second_line or higher cetuximab or panitumumab observed an association between EGFR copy number gain and increased OS and PFS (Jiang et al., 2013; 23441167). However, studies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cancer found either no association or a negative association between EGFR copy number gain and survival after treatment with first_line cetuximab or panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy (Licitra et al., 2011; 21048039, Smyth et al., 2020; 33199443). The Phase 3 INTELLANCE trial of depatuxizumab mafodotin (ABT_414), an EGFR_targeted antibody_drug conjugate with a toxic payload, in patients with EGFR_amplified glioblastoma (GBM) was stopped for futility. Interim analysis demonstrated improved median PFS (mPFS) of ABT_414 monotherapy compared with placebo (HR=0.84); however, no OS benefit was observed (HR=1.01). Improved mPFS was also observed in patients harboring EGFRvIII (HR=0.73) but without an OS improvement (HR=0.95) (Lassman et al., 2019; Neuro_Oncology Abstract ACTR_21). The Phase 2 INTELLANCE trial demonstrated clinical benefit for EGFR_amplified GBM for the combination of ABT_414, temozolomide, and radiotherapy (HR=0.66, p=0.017), but there was no evidence of efficacy for ABT_414 monotherapy (HR=1.04, p=0.83)(Bent et al., 2020; 31747009).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

In preclinical trials, cetuximab, matuzumab, and panitumumab were reported to be ineffective at blocking EGFR dimerization and activation in GBM cells expressing EGFR extracellular domain mutations (Gajadhar et al., 2012; 22232519). However, another study demonstrated that in patients with GBM harboring EGFR amplification but lacking expression of the EGFRvIII variant, treatment with cetuximab resulted in significantly better progression_free survival (PFS) and numerical (although not statistically significant) improvement in overall survival (OS) (Lv et al., 2012; 22752145). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Erlotinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Erlotinib is a small_molecule inhibitor of EGFR.

For patients with activating mutations in EGFR, treatment with erlotinib has been associated with improved response and lengthened time to progression (Cappuzzo et al., 2010; 20493771, Rosell et al., 2012; 22285168, Zhong et al., 2019; 31194613, Petrelli et al., 2011; 22056888). For patients with esophageal or biliary cancer treated with erlotinib or gefitinib, elevated EGFR copy number or amplification is associated with clinical responses and longer survival (Petty et al., 2017; 28537764, Philip et al., 2006; 16809731, Xie et al., 2020; 32958820, Luo et al., 2020; 33026449, Lee et al., 2012; 22192731). Responses to erlotinib have been reported for patients with EGFR rearrangements (Konduri et al., 2016; 27102076, Zhu et al., 2018; 29290255, Wang et al., 2018; 30255937, Baik et al., 2015; 26398831, Xu et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract e13538). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> In the MyPathway Phase 2a basket study for advanced solid tumors, 1 of 9 patients with EGFR activation mutations responded to erlotinib monotherapy; the responding patient had urethral adenocarcinoma (Hainsworth et al., 2018; 29320312). A patient with EGFR_mutated metastatic lacrimal gland adenoid cystic carcinoma experienced clinical benefit from erlotinib treatment that was ongoing at 14 months (Nie et al., 2018; 29998897). A clinical study of patients with glioblastoma (GBM) treated with gefitinib or erlotinib found that 9/49 (18%) had tumor shrinkage of 25% or more; in this study, the extracellular domain EGFRvIII mutation was correlated with response (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176). In a Phase 2 study of 65 patients with GBM or gliosarcoma, treatment with erlotinib, temozolomide, and radiotherapy resulted in longer progression_free survival relative to a historical control study utilizing a regimen of temozolomide and radiotherapy alone (19.3 months vs. 14.1 months)(Prados et al., 2009; 19075262). However, in a Phase 1/2 trial of erlotinib monotherapy in 11 patients with relapsed or refractory GBM or anaplastic astrocytoma, all patients showed disease progression and the drug showed significant toxicity (Kesavabhotla et al., 2012; 22946346). In addition, a Phase 2 trial of patients with recurrent or progressive GBM treated with erlotinib and sorafenib did not meet its objective of a 30% increase in overall survival time compared with historical controls; sorafenib was found to increase erlotinib clearance (Peereboom et al., 2013; 23328813). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT03239015", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03810872", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03618667", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04172597", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02800486", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02861898", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03783403", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02451553", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03829436", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02303678", "Include": "true"}]}}, {"Name": "EGFRvIII", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "EGFRvIII"}}, "Interpretation": "EGFR encodes the epidermal growth factor receptor, which belongs to a class of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases. In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). Amplification of EGFR has been associated with increased expression of EGFR mRNA and protein in several cancer types (Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Bhargava et al., 2005; 15920544, Yang et al., 2012; 22490401). A mutation of the EGFR gene, referred to as EGFRvIII, results from a gene rearrangement that deletes exons 2_7. This alteration causes an in_frame deletion of 801 base pairs encoding part of the extracellular ligand_binding domain (Nishikawa et al., 1994; 8052651). This deletion has shown to result in ligand_independent (constitutive) phosphorylation and activation of EGFR, as well as consequent tumorigenesis (Nishikawa et al., 1994; 8052651, Nedergaard et al., 2012; 22385404). EGFR mutations that have been characterized in biochemical assays to be activating, as observed here, are predicted to confer sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies (Foster et al., 2010; 20942962, Cai et al., 2008; 18193092, Stabile et al., 2005; 15735034, Zhang et al., 2006; 17409930, Siegfried et al., 2012; 22258476, ManChon et al., 2014; 24743239, Cho et al., 2014; 24894453, Hama et al., 2009; 19726454, Tam et al., 2009; 19671738, Kancha et al., 2009; 19147750, Chen et al., 2006; 16205628, Lee et al., 2006; 17177598, Ymer et al., 2011; 24212795, Razis et al., 2009; 19789313, Wang et al., 2011; 21532887, Cai et al., 2008; 18193092, Kim et al., 2019; 31290142, Sueangoen et al., 2020; 32190291, Lundby et al., 2019; 31585087). The EGFR A289V mutation, located in the extracellular domain, has been shown to be activating (Lee et al., 2006; 17177598). Glioblastoma cell lines harboring an EGFR A289V or A289D mutation were shown to be dependent on EGFR kinase activity (Vivanco et al., 2012; 22588883), and other mutations at this position are also likely activating. In addition, A289V is frequently associated with increased EGFR gene copy number (Lee et al., 2006; 17177598). Across several genomic studies of CNS tumors, EGFR amplification has been reported in 16.9% of anaplastic astrocytomas, and 39.7% of glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs)(Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031, Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509). Across several genomic studies of CNS tumors, EGFR alterations have been reported in 13.2% of anaplastic astrocytomas, 5.3_15.9% of glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs), and 0% of pilocytic astrocytomas (cbio_Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031, cbio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, cbio_Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, cbio_Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509). In the glioblastoma (GBM) TCGA dataset, putative high_level amplification of EGFR has been found in 48% of cases and mutation has been found in 21% of cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). Missense mutations in the EGFR extracellular domain have been found in 10_15% of GBMs and approximately half have a low_level amplification of the mutated allele (Lee et al., 2006; 17177598, Vivanco et al., 2012; 22588883). One study detected EGFR alterations in 50% (117/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed, including 41% (95/232) with a co_occurring EGFR amplification and mutation, 26% (61/232) with an EGFR domain truncation event, such as EGFRvIII, and 2.2% (5/232) with an EGFR fusion event (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). The EGFRvIII mutation has been variously reported in 6_46% of GBM samples (Nishikawa et al., 1994; 8052651, Shinojima et al., 2003; 14583498, Nishikawa et al., 2004; 15700833, Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176, Viana_Pereira et al., 2008; 18507036, Yoshimoto et al., 2008; 18223223, Larysz et al., 2011; 21455841, Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251, Lv et al., 2012; 22752145). No definitive correlation has been identified between EGFR amplification and length of survival in patients with GBM (Srividya et al., 2010; 20702468, Das et al., 2011; 20888234); however, EGFR amplification has been associated with prolonged survival in patients over the age of 60 with GBM (Smith et al., 2001; 11504770). The link between EGFRvIII status and prognosis is unclear, although some studies suggest that it may be linked to improved survival and response to chemotherapy (Montano et al., 2011; 22241957). In multiple glioblastoma (GBM) studies, the presence of EGFRvIII has not predicted clinical benefit from first_generation EGFR TKIs such as erlotinib (Van den Bent et al., 2009; 19204207, Haas_Kogen et al., 2005; 15956649, Brown et al., 2008; 18955445, Preusser et al., 2008; 18458820, Wen et al., 2014; 24470557, Gallego et al., 2013; 24352766) or gefitinib (Rich et al. 2004; 14638850, Uhm et al., 2011; 20510539, Preusser et al., 2008; 18458820). However, case reports have described patients with EGFRvIII_positive GBM responding to erlotinib (Doyle et al., 2018; 30410775, D Alessandris et al., 2013; 23132371, Custodio and Perez_Segura, 2010; 20462843, D Alessandris et al., 2018; 30306271). In a retrospective study of patients with GBM treated with erlotinib or gefitinib, co_expression of EGFRvIII with PTEN protein was the strongest predictor of response (P<0.001)(Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176), suggesting that activity in this setting is dependent on PTEN status (Mellinghoff et al., 2007; 17255257, Arif et al., 2018; 29492119). However, a prospective Phase 2 trial testing erlotinib monotherapy for patients with EGFRvIII and PTEN_positive recurrent glioblastoma reported minimal efficacy and was terminated (Gallego et al., 2013; 24352766). The second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib have shown minimal efficacy for patients with EGFRvIII glioblastoma (GBM)(Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Alshami et al., 2015; 26423602, Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). A Phase 1/2 study of afatinib, temozolomide, or the combination for patients with GBM reported clinical benefit, including for patients with EGFRvIII; however, temozolomide alone and in combination exhibited better responses than afatinib monotherapy (Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Alshami et al., 2015; 26423602). A Phase 2 trial of dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified GBM reported a DCR of 26% (5/19) among patients with EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII; however, the trial failed to meet its primary endpoint of 6_month PFS (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464). A retrospective biomarker analysis of another Phase 2 study of dacomitinib for patients with GBM found no association between EGFRvIII and clinical benefit (Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). A patient with multiple glioblastoma (GBM) tumors, one of which harbored EGFRvIII, experienced progression of the EGFRvIII_positive tumor during treatment with osimertinib (Makhlin et al., 2019; 31769726). Novel approaches that specifically target EGFRvIII in glioblastoma (GBM), such as the vaccine rindopepimut, are under investigation in both clinical and preclinical studies. A Phase 2 trial reported significant improvement in OS for patients with EGFRvIII_positive GBM with rindopepimut in combination with bevacizumab compared to bevacizumab alone (HR=0.53, p=0.01)(Reardon et al., 2020; 32034072). However, a Phase 3 study of rindopepimut combined with temozolomide compared to temozolomide alone in newly diagnosed EGFRvIII_positive GBM patients was terminated after the interim analysis, due to a lack of clinical benefit as measured by OS (20 vs. 20 months)(Weller et al., 2017; 28844499). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer, EGFR activating mutations may predict sensitivity to EGFR TKIs, including erlotinib (Rosell et al., 2011; 22285168), gefitinib (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064), afatinib (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960), dacomitinib (Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), and osimertinib (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549); however, the data for patients with other tumor types are limited (Hong et al., 2020; 32749686, Kim et al., 2015; 26462025, Kim et al., 2015; 25424851, Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840, Cavalieri et al., 2018; 29734047, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Audet et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 6041). A case study of a patient with multiple glioblastoma (GBM) tumors, one of which harbored EGFR amplification and multiple missense mutations, reported a near_CR of the EGFR_amplified and _mutated tumor to osimertinib (Makhlin et al., 2019; 31769726). A case series of 11 patients with bithalamic gliomas with EGFR mutations suggested that treatment with EGFR inhibitors, including osimertinib, prolonged patient survival relative to other types of treatment; however, no patients attained PR or SD (Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840). Clinical studies of the second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified gliomas have shown limited efficacy (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Blumenthal et al., 2016; 27531351); however, a small subset of patients has experienced clinical benefit (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). Multiple studies have failed to find a positive association between increased EGFR expression and clinical benefit from erlotinib or gefitinib for patients with glioblastoma (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176, Franceschi et al., 2007; 17353924, Chakravarti et al., 2013; 23182702, Hegi et al., 2011; 21471286, Rich et al. 2004; 14638850). There are conflicting data on the efficacy of anti_EGFR antibodies for the treatment of EGFR_amplified tumors. A meta_analysis of colorectal cancer patients treated with second_line or higher cetuximab or panitumumab observed an association between EGFR copy number gain and increased OS and PFS (Jiang et al., 2013; 23441167). However, studies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cancer found either no association or a negative association between EGFR copy number gain and survival after treatment with first_line cetuximab or panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy (Licitra et al., 2011; 21048039, Smyth et al., 2020; 33199443). The Phase 3 INTELLANCE trial of depatuxizumab mafodotin (ABT_414), an EGFR_targeted antibody_drug conjugate with a toxic payload, in patients with EGFR_amplified glioblastoma (GBM) was stopped for futility. Interim analysis demonstrated improved median PFS (mPFS) of ABT_414 monotherapy compared with placebo (HR=0.84); however, no OS benefit was observed (HR=1.01). Improved mPFS was also observed in patients harboring EGFRvIII (HR=0.73) but without an OS improvement (HR=0.95) (Lassman et al., 2019; Neuro_Oncology Abstract ACTR_21). The Phase 2 INTELLANCE trial demonstrated clinical benefit for EGFR_amplified GBM for the combination of ABT_414, temozolomide, and radiotherapy (HR=0.66, p=0.017), but there was no evidence of efficacy for ABT_414 monotherapy (HR=1.04, p=0.83)(Bent et al., 2020; 31747009).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

However, another study demonstrated that in patients with GBM harboring EGFR amplification but lacking expression of the EGFRvIII variant, treatment with cetuximab resulted in significantly better progression_free survival (PFS) and numerical (although not statistically significant) improvement in overall survival (OS) (Lv et al., 2012; 22752145). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Erlotinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Erlotinib is a small_molecule inhibitor of EGFR.

For patients with activating mutations in EGFR, treatment with erlotinib has been associated with improved response and lengthened time to progression (Cappuzzo et al., 2010; 20493771, Rosell et al., 2012; 22285168, Zhong et al., 2019; 31194613, Petrelli et al., 2011; 22056888). For patients with esophageal or biliary cancer treated with erlotinib or gefitinib, elevated EGFR copy number or amplification is associated with clinical responses and longer survival (Petty et al., 2017; 28537764, Philip et al., 2006; 16809731, Xie et al., 2020; 32958820, Luo et al., 2020; 33026449, Lee et al., 2012; 22192731). Responses to erlotinib have been reported for patients with EGFR rearrangements (Konduri et al., 2016; 27102076, Zhu et al., 2018; 29290255, Wang et al., 2018; 30255937, Baik et al., 2015; 26398831, Xu et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract e13538). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> In the MyPathway Phase 2a basket study for advanced solid tumors, 1 of 9 patients with EGFR activation mutations responded to erlotinib monotherapy; the responding patient had urethral adenocarcinoma (Hainsworth et al., 2018; 29320312). A patient with EGFR_mutated metastatic lacrimal gland adenoid cystic carcinoma experienced clinical benefit from erlotinib treatment that was ongoing at 14 months (Nie et al., 2018; 29998897). A clinical study of patients with glioblastoma (GBM) treated with gefitinib or erlotinib found that 9/49 (18%) had tumor shrinkage of 25% or more; in this study, the extracellular domain EGFRvIII mutation was correlated with response (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176). In a Phase 2 study of 65 patients with GBM or gliosarcoma, treatment with erlotinib, temozolomide, and radiotherapy resulted in longer progression_free survival relative to a historical control study utilizing a regimen of temozolomide and radiotherapy alone (19.3 months vs. 14.1 months)(Prados et al., 2009; 19075262). However, in a Phase 1/2 trial of erlotinib monotherapy in 11 patients with relapsed or refractory GBM or anaplastic astrocytoma, all patients showed disease progression and the drug showed significant toxicity (Kesavabhotla et al., 2012; 22946346). In addition, a Phase 2 trial of patients with recurrent or progressive GBM treated with erlotinib and sorafenib did not meet its objective of a 30% increase in overall survival time compared with historical controls; sorafenib was found to increase erlotinib clearance (Peereboom et al., 2013; 23328813). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT03239015", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03810872", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03618667", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04172597", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02800486", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02861898", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03783403", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02451553", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03829436", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02303678", "Include": "true"}]}}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "PIK3CA", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "G118D", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "G118D"}}, "Interpretation": "PIK3CA encodes p110_alpha, which is the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3_kinase (PI3K). The PI3K pathway is involved in cell signaling that regulates a number of critical cellular functions, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival (Samuels et al., 2005; 15950905, Engelman, 2009; 19629070). PIK3CA alterations that have been characterized as activating, such as observed here, are predicted to be oncogenic (Kang et al., 2005; 15647370, Ikenoue et al., 2005; 15930273, Gymnopoulos et al., 2007; 17376864, Horn et al., 2008; 18317450, Rudd et al., 2011; 21266528, Hon et al., 2012; 22120714, Burke et al., 2012; 22949682, Wu et al., 2009; 19915146, Dbouk et al., 2010; 2103068, Dan et al., 2010; 20530683, Oda et al., 2008; 18829572, Zhao and Vogt, 2008; 18794883, Lui et al., 2013; 23619167, Ross et al., 2013; 22430209, Riviere et al., 2012; 22729224, Shibata et al., 2009; 19394761, Droguluk et al., 2015; 26627007,Croessmann et al., 2018; 29284706, Ng et al., 2018; 29533785, Spangle et al., 2020; 32929011, Chen et al., 2018; 29636477). PIK3CA mutations have been reported in 9% of glioblastoma (GBM) samples analyzed in the TCGA dataset (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142), and other studies report the incidence of PIK3CA mutations in primary GBMs as 5_18% (Gallia et al., 2006; 17050665, Broderick et al., 2004; 15289301, El_Habr et al., 2010; 20569675). One study detected PIK3CA mutation in 16% (36/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). PIK3CA mutations have been reported in 5_23% of high_grade gliomas (including glioblastomas, anaplastic astrocytomas, and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas) (El_Habr et al., 2010; 20569675, Gallia et al., 2006; 17050665, Broderick et al., 2004; 15289301, Derakhshandeh_Peykar et al., 2011; 22026810, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890). While another study did not observe PIK3CA mutations in low_grade astrocytomas or in anaplastic astrocytomas, it did report high ERK and AKT activity (El_Habr et al., 2010; 20569675). One study found that PIK3CA mutation in glioblastoma (GBM) was associated with shorter median PFS in both a discovery cohort (6.9 vs. 12.4 months, HR=2.89, p=0.01) and in the TCGA cohort (6.1 vs. 9 months, p=0.008), but was not consistently associated with median OS (Tanaka et al., 2019; 31036078). In a study of IDH_wildtype GBM, patients with alterations in PI3K class I genes (PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PIK3CG, and PIK3R2) had significantly longer OS (20.0 months altered vs. 16.9 months wildtype, HR=0.62, p=0.002) and PFS (11.0 months altered vs. 7.4 months wildtype, p=0.0043); patients with PIK3CA alterations experienced an improved OS but this association was not highly significant (20.0 months altered vs. 18.1 months wildtype, p=0.0407)(Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Clinical and preclinical data in various tumor types indicate that PIK3CA activating alterations may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting PI3K (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574, Juric et al., 2018; 29401002, Gallant et al., 2019; 30793038), AKT (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Smyth et al., 2021; 33863913), or mTOR (Park et al., 2016; 27105424, Lim et al., 2016; 26859683, Hou et al., 2014; 25426553, Varnier et al., 2019; 31351267, Janku et al., 2014; 24440717, Moroney et al., 2012; 22927482, Basho et al., 2017; 27893038, Moroney et al., 2011; 21890452). In the Phase 2 MATCH trial for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors, 28% (18/65) of patients experienced PFS lasting at least 6 months after treatment with taselisib; however, no ORs were observed in this study (Krop et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 101). A separate Phase 1b study of taselisib in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors reported an ORR of 0% (n=12) and a DCR of 17% (2/12) (Pascual et al., 2021; 32958578). In a Phase 1 trial of the dual PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitor apitolisib, 79% (11/14) of patients with PIK3CA_mutated advanced solid tumors experienced disease control (3 PRs, 8 SDs) (Dolly et al., 2016; 26787751). The PI3K inhibitor alpelisib demonstrated an ORR of 6.0% (8/134) and a DCR of 58% (78/134) in a study for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors (Juric et al., 2018; 2941002). However, the PI3K inhibitor copanlisib exhibited limited efficacy in PIK3CA_mutated tumors (Santin et al., 2020; 31934607, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108). Activating mutations in PIK3CA may confer resistance to HER2_targeted therapies; combined inhibition of HER2 and the PI3K pathway may be required in HER2_positive tumors with PIK3CA mutation (Esteva et al., 2010; 20813970, Baselga et al., 2014; 25332247, Chakrabarty et al., 2010; 20581867, Cizkova et al., 2010; San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium Abstract P2_09_30, Kataoka et al., 2010; 19633047, Wang et al., 2011; 21676217).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PIK3CA activating mutations may lead to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may therefore indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.

A Phase 1/2 trial of temsirolimus in combination with sorafenib in glioblastoma was terminated at the Phase 2 interim analysis after patients failed to meet the primary endpoint of 6 month progression_free survival; significant toxicity was also observed in the combination therapy, even at low doses of temsirolimus (Lee et al., 2012; 23099651).

A Phase 2 trial of radiotherapy (RT), temozolomide (TMZ), and bevacizumab followed by everolimus and bevacizumab reported that 61% (31/51) of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma had objective responses with a median progression_free survival (PFS) of 11.3 months and median overall survival (OS) of 13.9 months (Hainsworth et al., 2012; 22706484). A Phase 2 study of everolimus combined with TMZ and RT for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma reported a median PFS of 6.4 months and median OS of 15.8 months (Ma et al., 2014; 25526733). A Phase 1 trial of everolimus plus TMZ for patients with newly diagnosed or progressive glioblastoma reported partial responses (PR) in 11% (3/28) and stable disease (SD) in 57% (16/28) of cases (Mason et al., 2011; 22160854).

Both p15INK4b and p16INK4a bind to and inhibit CDK4 and CDK6, thereby maintaining the growth_suppressive activity of the Rb tumor suppressor; loss or inactivation of either p15INK4b or p16INK4a contributes to dysregulation of the CDK4/6_cyclin_Rb pathway and loss of cell cycle control (Gazzeri et al., 1998; 9484839, Roussel, 1999; 10498883). The tumor suppressive functions of p14ARF involve stabilization and activation of p53, via a mechanism of MDM2 inhibition (Sherr et al., 2005; 16869746, Ozenne et al., 2010; 20549699).

One or more alterations seen here are predicted to result in p14ARF loss of function (Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Itahana and Zhang, 2008; 18538737, Zhang and Xiong, 1999; 10360174, Zhang et al., 1998; 9529249, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). CDKN2B alterations such as seen here are predicted to inactivate p15INK4b (Jafri et al., 2015; 25873077). Concurrent putative homozygous deletion of CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been reported in 35% of patients with gliomas (cBio_Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661) and detected more frequently in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; 58%)(cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142) than in those with lower grade gliomas (13%) (cBioPortal, Sep 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). In other studies, loss of CDKN2A/B by deletion has been reported in up to 78% of astrocytomas (including anaplastic astrocytomas and GBM) (Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Weber et al., 2007; 16909113). A study found homozygous deletion of both p16INK4a and p14ARF in 26% (13/50) of glioblastomas (GBMs); 18% (9/50) of cases showed homozygous deletion of the p14ARF_encoding locus alone (Nakamura et al., 2001; 11303791). One study detected CDKN2A/B loss in 69% (161/232) and mutation in 2.6% (6/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Decreased p14ARF and p16INK4a expression levels were found to be tightly associated in a study of glioma samples (Chakravarti et al., 2001; 11489817). Homozygous deletion of the genomic region including CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been found to be associated with poor prognosis in GBM and likely serves as an early event in GBM progression (Feng et al., 2012; 21713760, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337). In addition, expression of p16INK4a has been found to be lower in patients with high grade malignant gliomas compared to patients with low grade gliomas, and loss of p16INK4a expression has been associated with shorter overall survival in pilocytic astrocytomas (Raabe et al., 2011; 21636552, Liu et al., 2011; 21843312). Preclinical data suggest that tumors with loss of p16INK4a function may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, ribociclib, and palbociclib (Konecny et al., 2011; 21278246, Katsumi et al., 2011; 21871868, Cen et al., 2012; 22711607, Logan et al., 2013; 23898052). Although case studies have reported that patients with breast cancer or uterine leiomyosarcoma harboring CDKN2A loss responded to palbociclib treatment (Elvin et al., 2017; 28283584, Gao et al., 2015; 26715889), multiple other clinical studies have shown no significant correlation between p16INK4a loss or inactivation and therapeutic benefit of these agents (Gopalan et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8077, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Konecny et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5557)(DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Johnson et al., 2014; 24797823); it is not known whether CDK4/6 inhibitors would be beneficial in this case. Although preclinical studies have suggested that loss of p14ARF function may be associated with reduced sensitivity to MDM2 inhibitors (Van Maerken et al., 2011; 21460101, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357), the clinical relevance of p14ARF as a predictive biomarker is not clear. There are no drugs that directly target the mutation or loss of CDKN2B in cancer. Because the p15INK4b protein encoded by CDKN2B is known to inhibit CDK4, tumors with CDKN2B mutation or loss may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as ribociclib, abemaciclib, and palbociclib (Infante et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 2528, Shapiro et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 2500)(Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126). Germline CDKN2A mutation is associated with melanoma_pancreatic cancer syndrome, a condition marked by increased risk of developing malignant melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer (Whelan et al., 1995; 7666917). Mutation carriers within families may develop either or both types of cancer, and melanoma cases may be referred to as familial or hereditary melanoma (Hansson, 2010; 20687502, Hogg et al., 1998; 9479083). CDKN2A is the most implicated gene in familial melanoma, with germline mutations present in 16% to 20% of familial melanoma cases (De Unamuno et al., 2018; 29543703, Soura et al., 2016; 26892650, Huerta et al., 2018; 29405243). CDKN2A alteration has also been implicated in familial melanoma_astrocytoma syndrome, an extremely rare tumor association characterized by dual predisposition to melanoma and nervous system tumors (Kaufman et al., 1993; 8414022, Bahuau et al., 1998; 9622062, Chan et al., 2017; 28699883). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of CDKN2A is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}, {"Name": "CDKN2B loss", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "CDKN2B loss"}}, "Interpretation": "CDKN2A encodes two different, unrelated tumor suppressor proteins, p16INK4a and p14ARF, whereas CDKN2B encodes the tumor suppressor p15INK4b (Quelle et al., 1995; 8521522, Sharpless, 2005; 15878778). Both p15INK4b and p16INK4a bind to and inhibit CDK4 and CDK6, thereby maintaining the growth_suppressive activity of the Rb tumor suppressor; loss or inactivation of either p15INK4b or p16INK4a contributes to dysregulation of the CDK4/6_cyclin_Rb pathway and loss of cell cycle control (Gazzeri et al., 1998; 9484839, Roussel, 1999; 10498883). The tumor suppressive functions of p14ARF involve stabilization and activation of p53, via a mechanism of MDM2 inhibition (Sherr et al., 2005; 16869746, Ozenne et al., 2010; 20549699). One or more alterations observed here are predicted to result in p16INK4a loss of function (Ruas et al., 1999; 10498896, Jones et al., 2007; 17909018, Haferkamp et al., 2008; 18843795, Huot et al., 2002; 12417717, Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Gombart et al., 1997; 9324288, Yang et al., 1995; 7780957, Parry and Peters, 1996; 8668202, Greenblatt et al., 2003; 12606942, Yarbrough et al., 1999; 10491434, Poi et al., 2001; 11255261, Byeon et al., 1998; 9660926, Kannengiesser et al., 2009; 19260062, Lal et al., 2000; 10719365, Koh et al., 1995; 7777061, McKenzie et al., 2010; 20340136, Miller et al., 2011; 21462282, Arap et al., 1997; 905385, Scaini et al., 2014; 24659262, Jenkins et al., 2013; 23190892, Walker et al., 1999; 10389768, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). One or more alterations seen here are predicted to result in p14ARF loss of function (Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Itahana and Zhang, 2008; 18538737, Zhang and Xiong, 1999; 10360174, Zhang et al., 1998; 9529249, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). CDKN2B alterations such as seen here are predicted to inactivate p15INK4b (Jafri et al., 2015; 25873077). Concurrent putative homozygous deletion of CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been reported in 35% of patients with gliomas (cBio_Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661) and detected more frequently in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; 58%)(cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142) than in those with lower grade gliomas (13%) (cBioPortal, Sep 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). In other studies, loss of CDKN2A/B by deletion has been reported in up to 78% of astrocytomas (including anaplastic astrocytomas and GBM) (Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Weber et al., 2007; 16909113). A study found homozygous deletion of both p16INK4a and p14ARF in 26% (13/50) of glioblastomas (GBMs); 18% (9/50) of cases showed homozygous deletion of the p14ARF_encoding locus alone (Nakamura et al., 2001; 11303791). One study detected CDKN2A/B loss in 69% (161/232) and mutation in 2.6% (6/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Decreased p14ARF and p16INK4a expression levels were found to be tightly associated in a study of glioma samples (Chakravarti et al., 2001; 11489817). Homozygous deletion of the genomic region including CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been found to be associated with poor prognosis in GBM and likely serves as an early event in GBM progression (Feng et al., 2012; 21713760, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337). In addition, expression of p16INK4a has been found to be lower in patients with high grade malignant gliomas compared to patients with low grade gliomas, and loss of p16INK4a expression has been associated with shorter overall survival in pilocytic astrocytomas (Raabe et al., 2011; 21636552, Liu et al., 2011; 21843312).

Decreased expression of MTAP leads to MTA accumulation within tumor cells and their microenvironment (Kirovski et al., 2011; 21356366, Limm et al., 2013; 23265702, Stevens et al., 2009; 19097084), thereby reducing intracellular arginine methylation (Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473, Mavrakis et al., 2016; 26912361, Kryukov et al., 2016; 26912360) and altering cell signaling (Limm et al., 2014; 25087184, Stevens et al., 2009; 19097084). MTAP is located at 9p21, adjacent to CDKN2A and CDKN2B, with which it is frequently co_deleted in various cancers. Other alterations in MTAP are rare and have not been extensively characterized. MTAP loss/homozygous deletion as well as loss of expression has been reported in a wide variety of solid tumors and hematologic cancers (Wei et al., 2016; 27929028, Zhao and Zhao, 2016; 27556634); such events have been correlated with poor prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (Kirovski et al., 2011; 21356366), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (Huang et al., 2009; 19887491), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)(Marce et al., 2006; 16778103), melanoma (Meyer et al., 2010; 20500769, Wild et al., 2006; 16618867), gastric cancer (Kim et al., 2011; 21412930), myxofibrosarcoma (Li et al., 2014; 25426549), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (He et al., 2015; 26656376), ovarian carcinoma (Wei et al., 2016; 27929028) and non_small cell lung cancer (Su et al., 2014; 24969958). MTAP loss was not prognostic in pediatric B_cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (Mirebeau et al., 2006; 16818274) or in astrocytoma (Becker et al., 2015; 26088413). However, MTAP has also been reported to be overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (Snezhkina et al., 2016; 27433286), and MTAP retention is thought to be important for prostate cancer growth due to continuous supply of SAM (Bistulfi et al., 2016; 26910893). Germline SNPs in MTAP have been correlated with the development of cutaneous melanoma (Antonopoulou et al., 2015; 25407435, Mccioni et al., 2013; 23816148), esophageal cancer (Hyland et al., 2016; 26635288, Lin et al., 2017; 27960044), osteosarcoma (Zhi et al., 2016; 27994653), and CRC (Gu et al., 2013; 23361049). Preclinical and limited clinical evidence indicate that MTAP inactivation produces specific metabolic vulnerabilities. MTAP inactivation may confer sensitivity to MAT2A inhibitors (Heist et al., 2019; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract B116, Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473). A Phase 1 trial of MAT2A inhibitor AG_270 reported 1 PR and 2 SDs lasting longer than 6 months for patients with advanced solid tumors displaying MTAP loss (Heist et al., 2019; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract B116). Although preclinical data have suggested that MTAP loss sensitizes cells to PRMT5 inhibition (Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473, Mavrakis et al., 2016; 26912361, Kryukov et al., 2016; 2691236), MTAP loss may not be a biomarker of response to previously developed small_molecule SAM_uncompetitive PRMT5 inhibitors (Guccione and Richard, 2019; 31350521); dual PRMT1 and PRMT5 inhibition may be more effective (Fedoriw et al., 2019; 31257072, Srour et al., 2019; 31287990, Gao et al., 2019; 30916320). In preclinical cancer models, MTAP inactivation showed increased sensitivity to inhibitors of purine synthesis or purine analogs, especially upon addition of exogenous MTA, which is converted to adenine in normal cells, thereby providing competition to purine poisons lacking in MTAP_deficient cells (Hansen et al., 2019; 31040154, Tang et al., 2018; 29844120, Munshi et al., 2014; 24928612, de Oliveira et al., 2016; 26751376, Lubin and Lubin, 2009; 19478948, Tang et al., 2012; 22825330, Collins et al., 2012; 22252602, Bertino et al., 2011; 21301207, Coulthard et al., 2011; 21282358, Miyazaki et al., 2007; 17912432, Efferth et al., 2002; 11987241). A Phase 2 study of L_alanosine, an inhibitor of adenine synthesis, as a monotherapy for 65 patients with MTAP_deficient cancers reported no responses and stable disease in 23.6% (13/55) of patients (Kindler et al., 2009; 18618081).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). Low_level MSI has been reported in 5_9% of glioblastoma (GBM) samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927, Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285, Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). A large_scale study did not find high_level microsatellite instability (MSI_H) in any of 129 GBM samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), although a small_scale study reported MSI_H in 4 of 15 pediatric GBMs and 1 of 12 adult GBMs (Szybka et al., 2003; 12908754). The frequency of MSI has been reported to be increased in relapsed compared to primary GBM (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), in GBMs with a previous lower grade astrocytoma (Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285), and in giant cell GBM compared to classic GBM (Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TERT", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "promoter _124C>T", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "promoter _124C>T"}}, "Interpretation": "Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT, or hTERT) is a catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex, which is required to maintain appropriate chromosomal length (Shay et al., 2011; 22015685). Activation of TERT is a hallmark of cancer, being detected in up to 80_90% of malignancies and absent in quiescent cells (Shay et al., 1997; 9282118, Kim et al., 1994; 7605428, Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000; 10647931). Mutations within the promoter region of TERT that confer enhanced TERT promoter activity have been reported in two hotspots, located at _124 bp and _146 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (also termed C228T and C250T, respectively)(Horn et al., 2013; 23348503, Huang et al., 2014; 23348506, Vinagre et al., 2013; 23887589), as well as tandem mutations at positions \u2013124/\u2013125 bp and \u2013138/\u2013139 bp (Horn et al., 2013; 23348503). TERT promoter mutations have been reported in 51_59% of gliomas (Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Killela et al., 2014; 24722048), most frequently in glioblastoma (GBM, 54_84%), gliosarcoma (81%), oligodendroglioma (78%), and historically in oligoastrocytomas (25_31%) but less frequently in lower grade astrocytomas (10_18%) and in only 1% of ependymomas (Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Liu et al., 2013; 23603989, Koelsche et al., 2013; 24154961, Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Killela et al., 2014; 24722048). In patients with glioblastoma (GBM), the prevalence of TERT promoter mutation is lower in pediatric primary GBM (11%) and adult secondary GBM (28%) compared with adult primary GBM (58_83%) (Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Killela et al., 2013; 23530248). One study detected TERT promoter mutations in 78% (181/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). The significance of the TERT promoter mutation as an independent prognostic indicator in patients with glioma is not clear. While TERT promoter mutations significantly associate with poor prognosis in patients with GBM, this correlation may be due to the association with primary GBM as opposed to IDH_positive secondary GBM (Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Reitman et al., 2013; 24217890, Arita et al., 2013; 23764841). In the context of IDH_wildtype glioma, TERT mutations are associated with reduced OS, whereas in IDH_mutated, 1p/19q co_deleted oligodendroglioma, TERT mutations are associated with improved OS (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v5.2020). TERT promoter mutation has been shown to be significantly associated with increased TERT gene expression in astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and GBM (Arita et al., 2013; 23764841). Therapeutic options for targeting tumors with TERT mutations are limited, although a variety of approaches are under development, including immunotherapies utilizing TERT as a tumor_associated antigen, antisense oligonucleotide_ or peptide_based therapies, and TERT promoter_directed cytotoxic molecules. TERT mutations are associated with 1p/19q co_deletion in oligodendrogliomas, and are highly recurrent in IDH/ATRX_wildtype glioblastoma (GBM) (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v5.2020). Co_occurring TERT mutation, IDH mutation, and 1p/19q co_deletion is indicative of oligodendroglioma, whereas IDH mutation in the absence of TERT mutation is suggestive of astrocytoma (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v5.2020).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "03", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "03"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Touat et al., 2020; 32322066, Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556, Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642). Glioblastoma (GBM) harbors a median TMB of 2.7 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 4.2% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). For pediatric patients, high TMB has been reported in a subset of high_grade gliomas, frequently in association with mutations in mismatch repair or proofreading genes and in TP53, whereas BRAF alterations or other oncogene fusions were observed more frequently in brain tumors harboring low TMB (Patel et al., 2020; 32386112, Johnson et al., 2017; 28912153). Increased TMB has been reported to correlate with higher tumor grade in glioma (Draaisma et al., 2015; 26699864) and glioblastoma (GBM) tissue samples with biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD) (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570), as well as with shorter OS of patients with diffuse glioma (Wang et al., 2020; 32164609). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In glioma, a lack of association between TMB and clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors has been reported (Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Touat et al., 2020; 32322066). However, multiple case studies have reported that patients with ultramutated gliomas driven by POLE mutations have benefited from treatment with anti_PD_1 (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556) or anti_PD_L1 (Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642) therapies. Therefore, although increased TMB alone may not be a strong biomarker for PD_1 or PD_L1 inhibitors in this cancer type, these agents may have efficacy for patients with glioma harboring both high TMB and POLE mutation.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "EGFR", "Alteration": "R108K, R222CA289TamplificationEGFRvIII", "Title": "Efficacy and Safety of Targeted Precision Therapy in Refractory Tumor With Druggable Molecular Event", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB4, PARP, mTOR, MET, RET, ROS1, VEGFRs, BRAF, CDK4, CDK6", "Locations": "Shanghai (China)", "NCTID": "NCT03239015", "Note": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.
