CCND2 has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210), and may be biologically relevant in this context (Zack et al., 2013; 24071852, Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). In the TCGA dataset, CCND2 amplification was observed in 3% of glioblastoma cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142) and 7% of lower grade glioma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751). CCND2 amplification has been reported in 3% of primary malignant gliomas in one study, with amplification occurring in one anaplastic astrocytoma and two glioblastoma cases (B\u00fcschges et al., 1999; 10416984). CCND2 mRNA expression has been reported to be increased in higher grade (3 and 4) astrocytoma tumors as compared to lower grade tumors (Kheirollahi et al., 2011; 20077038). Cyclin D2 has been reported to be the main cyclin expressed in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) but was barely detectable in differentiated glioblastoma cells (Koyama_Nasu et al., 2013; 22964630). Cyclin D2, in complex with CDK4/6, has been reported to be involved in the cell cycle progression of undifferentiated GSCs, but not differentiated GSCs, and to be involved in their tumorigenicity (Koyama_Nasu et al., 2013; 22964630). High CCND2 nuclear expression at the time of initial surgery for patients with glioblastoma was reported to significantly associate with early mortality in a multivariate analysis of 72 patients (Bouchart et al., 2019; 31568682). Although preclinical studies suggest that cyclin D2 activates CDK4/6 (Busk et al., 2005; 15707582, Busk, 2003; 12695654), it is unknown whether CCND2 amplification or activating mutation predicts response to CDK4/6 inhibitors such as abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib. Clinical studies of CDK4/6 inhibitors have shown the most promise for estrogen receptor_positive breast cancer (Finn et al., 2014; 25524798, DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "CCND2 amplification or activation may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04282031", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02933736", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05252416", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03310879", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05159245", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03994796", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02896335", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "CDK6", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "CDK6 encodes cyclin_dependent kinase 6, which regulates the cell cycle, differentiation, senescence, and apoptosis (Meyerson et al., 1994; 8114739, Grossel and Hinds, 2006; 16294322, Choi et al., 2014; 23644662). CDK6 and its functional homolog CDK4 are activated by D_type cyclins and promote cell cycle progression by inactivating the tumor suppressor Rb (Weinberg et al., 1995; 7736585, Musgrove et al., 2011; 21734724). Amplification of the chromosomal region that includes CDK6 has been reported in multiple cancer types, and has been associated with overexpression of CDK6 protein (Ismail et al., 2011; 21593195, van Dekken et al., 2009; 19167610). CDK6 amplification was reported in 5% (2/37) of malignant astrocytomas but not in 13 low_grade astrocytomas in one study (Costello et al., 1997; 9102208). In the Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) TCGA dataset, CDK6 mutation has not been found, while putative CDK6 amplification has been reported in 3% of cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890). CDK6 amplification has also been reported in GBM in the scientific literature (Bax et al., 2010; 20570930, Hodgson et al., 2009; 19139420, Ruano et al., 2006; 17002787). Studies have reported higher expression of CDK6 in high_grade gliomas than in low_grade gliomas (Costello et al., 1997; 9102208, Li et al., 2012; 22736304, Lam et al., 2000; 10884881). Elevated CDK6 expression in glioblastoma tumor margins was associated with reduced survival (Chen et al., 2013; 23594394). Knockdown or inhibition of CDK6 was associated with reduced proliferation of GBM cells and reduced growth of GBM xenografts (Chen et al., 2013; 23594394, Michaud et al., 2010; 20354191). Tumors with CDK6 activation may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib (Infante et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 2528, Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Finn et al., 2014; 25524798, Turner et al., 2015; 26030518, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27217383). Clinical benefit has been reported for patients with CDK6_amplified or mutated solid tumors in response to treatment with ribociclib (Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Konecny et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5557).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Tumors with CDK6 amplification may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04282031", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03239015", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02933736", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05252416", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03310879", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05159245", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03994796", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02896335", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "IDH1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "R132H", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "48.46", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "R132H"}}, "Interpretation": "The isocitrate dehydrogenases IDH1 and IDH2 encode highly homologous enzymes that are involved in the citric acid (TCA) cycle and other metabolic processes, playing roles in normal cellular metabolism and in protection against oxidative stress and apoptosis (Reitman and Yan, 2010; 20513808). R132 is located within the active site of IDH1 and is a hotspot for mutations in cancer (Jin et al., 2011; 21326614, Gross et al., 2010; 20142433, Ward et al., 2010; 20171147, Leonardi et al., 2012; 22442146, Reitman and Yan, 2010; 20513808). Substitutions at IDH1 R132 alter the enzymatic activity of IDH1, resulting in the production of the oncometabolite, D_2_hydroxyglutarate (2_HG)(Dang et al., 2009; 19935646, Ward et al., 2012; 21996744, Ward et al., 2010; 20171147, Gross et al., 2010; 20142433, Leonardi et al., 2012; 22442146), which promotes tumorigenesis (Gross et al., 2010; 20142433, Figueroa et al., 2010; 21130701, Xu et al., 2011; 21251613, Turcan et al., 2012; 22343889, Duncan et al., 2012; 22899282). IDH1 mutation is characteristic of low_grade gliomas and secondary glioblastoma, and is relatively rare in primary glioblastoma (Chaumeil et al., 2013; 24019001, Hartmann et al., 2013; 23918605, Rossetto et al., 2011; 21885076, Shin et al., 2013; 24129546, Parsons et al., 2008; 18772396). In the TCGA datasets, IDH1 mutation has been found in 77% of lower grade glioma cases and in 5% of glioblastoma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751, cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). IDH1 mutations are highly prevalent in grade 2 and grade 3 astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and oligoastrocytoma, reported in 43_100% of grade 2 tumors and 45_93% of grade 3 tumors (Thota et al., 2012; 22904127, Killela et al., 2013; 24140581, Haberler and W\u00f6hrer, 2014; 24559763, Yan et al., 2009; 19228619). IDH1/2 mutations are a strong favorable prognostic marker for OS in Grade 2_3 glioma, particularly in combination with 1p/19q codeletion (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022). Several studies have found IDH1 mutations to be associated with improved prognosis and longer PFS and OS in patients with various types of glioma including anaplastic astrocytoma and GBM (Hartmann et al., 2010; 21088844, Sonoda et al., 2009; 19765000, Ahmadi et al., 2012; 22528790, Jiang et al., 2013; 23486687, Shibahara et al., 2012; 21971842, Parsons et al., 2008; 18772396, Juratli et al., 2012; 23015095, Weller et al., 2009; 19805672). IDH1 mutations that lead to production of 2_HG, most commonly R132 alterations, may predict sensitivity to IDH1_mutation_specific inhibitors such as ivosidenib (Abou_Alfa et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA10, Fan et al., 2019; 31028664, Mellinghoff et al., 2017; SNO Abstract ACTR_46, Tap et al., 2016; CTOS Abstract P1_138) and olutasidenib (De la Fuenta et al., 2022; 35639513, Jones et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2020.38.15_suppl.e16643). A Phase 1B/2 basket study of the IDH1 inhibitor olutasidenib reported a DCR of 48% (12/25, 2 PR) in patients with glioma; patients with other solid tumors including intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and chondrosarcoma achieved SD (De la Fuenta et al., 2022; 35639513, Jones et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2020.38.15_suppl.e16643). A Phase 1 study of the pan_IDH1/IDH2 inhibitor vorasidenib for patients with IDH1_ or IDH2_mutated glioma reported an ORR of 18% (4/22; RANO criteria) and median PFS of 31.4 months for non_enhancing cases and median PFS of 7.5 months for the overall glioma population (n=52) (Mellinghoff et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 2504). Preclinical studies suggested that IDH1 neomorphic mutations may also confer sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Philip et al., 2018; 29719265, Molenaar et al., 2018; 29339439, Lu et al., 2017; 28202508, Sulkowski et al., 2017; 28148839). In a Phase 1 trial of the PD_L1 inhibitor atezolizumab for patients with glioblastoma (GBM), 2/3 patients with IDH1_mutated tumors experienced clinical benefit (1 PR, 1 long_term SD, 1 short_term SD), whereas none of the 8 patients with IDH1_wildtype GBM experienced benefit (8/8 PD); significantly longer PFS and a trend toward longer OS were observed for patients with IDH1_mutated tumors compared with the patients with IDH1_wildtype tumors (Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642). A Phase 1 trial of the oral brain_penetrant mutated IDH1 selective inhibitor DS_1001 for patients with recurrent or progressive IDH1_mutated glioma reported 2 CRs and 4 PRs for 35 patients with enhancing tumors and 1 PR and 3 minor responses (MRs) for 12 patients with non_enhancing tumors (Natsume et al., 2022; 35722822). Preclinical data indicate that IDH1_mutated glioma may be sensitive to the glutaminase inhibitor telaglenastat in combination with radiotherapy (McBrayer et al., 2018; 30220459, Kizilbash et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract TPS2075). IDH1/2 mutations are associated with improved survival outcomes for patients with glioma treated with radiation or alkylating chemotherapy (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022). Addition of procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (PCV) to radiotherapy significantly improved OS for patients with IDH_mutated (9.4 vs. 5.7 years, HR=0.59) but not IDH_non_mutated (1.3 versus 1.8 years, HR=1.14) anaplastic oligodendroglioma/oligoastrocytoma (Cairncross et al., 2014; 24516018). As adjuvant therapy after radiation for patients with IDH1/2_mutated anaplastic astrocytoma, temozolomide (van den Bent et al., 2021; 34000245) or PCV (Esteyrie et al., 2021; 33524191) improved median PFS and median OS relative to radiotherapy or temozolomide alone, respectively. IDH mutation in the absence of TERT mutation is suggestive of astrocytoma (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022)(Weller et al., 2020; 33293629). IDH1/2 mutation is associated with Grade 2 and 3 astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, with the latter also harboring 1p19q deletion, and distinguishes secondary glioblastoma (GBM) from primary GBM (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022). ATRX mutations often co_occur with IDH1/2 mutations and may be indicative of Grade 2_3 astrocytoma or secondary glioblastoma (GBM) (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022)(Louis et al., 2016; 27157931, Weller et al., 2020; 33293629).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "IDH1 mutations may predict sensitivity to IDH1 inhibitors.

MET has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210), with amplification positively correlating with protein expression in some cancer types (Ang et al., 2013; 23898085, Abou_Bakr and Elbasmi, 2013; 23996864, Ho et al., 2013; 24258573, Dziadziuszko et al., 2012; 22237262, Madoz_G\u00farpide et al., 2015; 26319934) and associating with therapeutic response to MET inhibitors in a variety of cancer types (Kwak et al., 2015; ASCO GI Abstract 01, Ou et al., 2011; 21623265, Schwab et al., 2014; 24192513, Lennerz et al., 2011; 22042947, Chi et al., 2012; 22162573, Palma et al., 2014; 25232318, Le et al., 2015; 25922291, Ali et al., 2015; 25882375, Kwak et al., 2015; 26432108). In the glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) TCGA dataset, putative amplification of MET is reported in 2.5% of cases whereas MET mutation is reported in 0.4% of cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). Lower level gain of MET has been reported in 47% and 44% of primary and secondary GBM, respectively, and in 38% of diffuse astrocytomas (Pierscianek et al., 2013; 22672415). Multiple studies have reported MET expression to be associated with poor prognosis in patients with GBM (Abounader and Laterra, 2005; 16212809, Liu et al., 2011; 20832323, Olmez et al., 2013; 23740136); however, one study reported improved overall survival in patients with GBM expressing MET relative to those negative for MET expression (Kwak et al., 2015; 26823824). On the basis of extensive clinical evidence, MET amplification or activating mutations may predict sensitivity to MET_targeting therapies such as kinase inhibitors crizotinib, capmatinib, tepotinib, and cabozantinib. In a Phase 1b/2 trial for patients with MET_amplified recurrent glioblastoma, no responses were observed following treatment with capmatinib monotherapy (n=10) or capmatinib combined with buparlisib (n=33); patients in the combination therapy arm additionally harbored PTEN inactivating alterations (Van den Bent et al., 2020; 31776899). Crizotinib has benefited patients with MET_amplified non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of varied histologies (Vassal et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 2595, Li et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 8090, Ou et al., 2011; 21623265, Schwab et al., 2014; 24192513, Le et al., 2015; 25922291, Schrock et al., 2017; 28315738), gastroesophageal cancer (Lennerz et al., 2011; 22042947), glioblastoma (Chi et al., 2012; 22162573), and carcinoma of unknown primary (Palma et al., 2014; 25232318). Capmatinib has demonstrated clinical efficacy for patients with MET_amplified cholangiocarcinoma (Lefler et al., 2022; 35129063), as well as MET_amplified NSCLC, both as a monotherapy (Schuler et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9067, Wu et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P1.01_97, Wolf et al., 2020; 32877583) and in combination with an EGFR TKI for patients with concurrent activating EGFR mutations (Wu et al., 2018; 30156984, Gainor et al., 2020; 31864558, Gautschi et al., 2020; 31864554). Tepotinib has demonstrated efficacy for patients with MET_amplified hepatocellular carcinoma (Faivre et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 329) and NSCLC (Le et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9021) as a monotherapy as well as in combination with gefitinib for patients with MET_amplified and EGFR_mutated NSCLC (Yang et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT193, Park et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 477O, Wu et al., 2019; IASLC Abstract MA09.09). Savolitinib elicited responses for patients with MET_amplified gastric cancer either alone or in combination with docetaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834, Kim et al., 2019; 30695737). AMG 337 elicited an ORR of 50% (5/10), including 1 CR, for patients with MET_amplified gastric, esophageal, or gastroesophageal junction cancer (Kwak et al., 2015; ASCO GI Abstract 01). Patients with MET_amplified NSCLC (Spigel et al., 2013; 24101053) or MET_amplified gastric cancer (Catenacci et al., 2011; 22389872) treated with the MET_targeting antibody onartuzumab (MetMAb) achieved clinical responses. In addition, high MET expression has been suggested to predict patient response to therapies such as the monoclonal HGF_targeting antibody rilotumumab as well as the combination of ramucirumab and the monoclonal MET_targeting antibody emibetuzumab (Oliner et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract 4005, Harding et al., 2019; 31142504). The Phase 2 LUMINOSITY study of the MET antibody drug conjugate telisotuzumab vedotin (teliso_V) reported a 37% (19/52) ORR for patients with non_squamous EGFR_wildtype tumors; lower ORRs were observed for patients with squamous (11%, 3/27) or non_squamous EGFR_mutated (12%, 5/43) tumors (Camidge et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT179). A Phase 1 study showed that teliso_V plus osimertinib yielded an ORR of 56% (10/18) for patients with EGFR_mutated MET_overexpressing NSCLC who progressed on osimertinib, including ORRs of 56% (5/9) for patients with an EGFR L858R mutation and 67% (6/9) for those with an EGFR exon 19 deletion (Goldman et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 9013).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Activating MET alterations may confer sensitivity to MET inhibitors.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Cabozantinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Cabozantinib inhibits multiple tyrosine kinases, including MET, RET, VEGFRs, and ROS1.

In a preclinical study, cabozantinib treatment reduced GBM tumor growth in 3 xenograft mouse lines, and increased survival in two of these lines, while showed no effect on the overall survival in the third line; however, combination treatment with cabozantinib resulted in sensitization of these xenografts to TMZ treatment (deCarvalho et al., 2014; AACR Abstract 3795). A Phase 1 ascending dose study of cabozantinib in patients with advanced solid tumors has reported early indications of drug response and prolonged stable disease, with no dose_limiting toxicities or serious adverse events (Yamamoto et al., 2011; AACR_EORTC Abstract C26). Another Phase 1 study of cabozantinib in high_grade gliomas included 1 patient with anaplastic astrocytoma who had stable disease for >900 days (Schiff et al., 2013; Neuro_Oncology Annual Meeting Abstract MR026). A Phase 1 study examining the combination of cabozantinib and temozolomide for patients with high_grade gliomas reported that the combination was safe; however, dose reductions were common and 62% of patients experienced treatment_related grade 3/4 adverse events (Schiff et al., 2015; 26588662). The combination of cabozantinib and crizotinib has been found to result in an increase in overall survival in a glioblastoma xenograft model (Navis et al., 2013; 23484006). Cabozantinib treatment has also been reported to result in decreased endothelial cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, and an inhibition of tumor growth in mouse models of breast, glioma, and lung tumors (Yakes et al., 2011; 21926191). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Tepotinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Tepotinib is a selective MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is FDA approved to treat patients with non_small cell lung cancer harboring MET exon 14 skipping alterations.

Tepotinib has primarily been investigated in non_small cell lung cancer and has demonstrated efficacy as a single agent for patients with MET amplification (Le et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9021) and MET exon 14_skipping alterations (Paik et al., 2020; 32469185, Mazieres et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 1283P). Tepotinib has also been shown to be efficacious in combination with gefitinib for patients with concurrent EGFR mutation and MET amplification or MET overexpression in Phase 2 studies (Wu et al., 2019; IASLC Abstract MA09.09, Park et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 477O). In advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, Phase 2 studies of tepotinib reported improved ORR and PFS for both treatment_naive and previously treated patients with MET protein overexpression (Ryoo et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 186P, Ryoo et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 621PD, Decaens et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 698P, Faivre et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 329).

ATRX inactivation or loss of expression is associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)(Lovejoy et al., 2012; 22829774, Bower et al, 2012; 23185534; Heaphy et al., 2011; 21719641, Liau et al., 2015; 25229770). Alterations that disrupt the ADD domain (aa 167_270) or helicase domain (aa 2010_2280) of ATRX are predicted to result in loss of ATRX function (Nan et al., 2007; 17296936, Garrick et al., 2004; 14729260, Eustermann et al., 2011; 21666677); however, the loss of ATRX function is not sufficient to induce ALT, which requires other undetermined factors (Clynes et al., 2013; 23916100, Flynn et al., 2015; 25593184). Germline mutations in ATRX give rise to alpha_thalassemia X_linked intellectual disability syndrome (ATR_X syndrome)(Gibbons et al., 1995; 7697714). Somatic mutation of ATRX has been reported in a number of solid tumor types, often associated with ALT (Heaphy et al., 2011; 21719641). ATRX mutation correlating with ALT has been reported in 10_20% of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs)(Singhi et al., 2015; USCAP Abstract 1797)(Jiao et al., 2011; 21252315, Heaphy et al., 2011; 21719641), 12.6% of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (Fishbein et al., 2015; 25608029), and 48% of adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with glioblastoma (GBM) or neuroblastoma (Morosini et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 11008)(Cheung et al., 2012; 22416102, Molenaar et al., 2012; 22367537, Pugh et al., 2013; 23334666, Cheung and Dyer, 2013; 23702928). ATRX loss in PNET (Singhi et al., 2015; USCAP Abstract 1797)(Marinoni et al., 2014; 24148618) and melanoma (Qadeer et al., 2014; 24468746) and mutation in other neuroendocrine tumors (Fishbein et al., 2015; 25608029) is associated with poor prognosis. Pediatric patients with high_grade glioma and ATRX mutation were shown to have more aggressive disease but are more responsive to treatment with double_strand break therapy (Koschmann et al., 2016; 26936505). ATRX mutation or loss of expression is more frequent in Grade 2/3 astrocytoma and secondary GBM than primary GBM, oligodendroglioma, and oligoastrocytoma (Kannan et al., 2012; 23104868, Haberler and W\u00f6hrer, 2014; 24559763, Reuss et al., 2014; 25427834, Sahm et al., 2014; 25143301) and has been proposed as a distinguishing biomarker (Haberler and W\u00f6hrer, 2014; 24559763, Reuss et al., 2014; 25427834, Sahm et al., 2014; 25143301). ATRX mutation has not been detected in concurrence with MYCN amplification in glioma and neuroblastoma (Cheung et al., 2012; 22416102, Molenaar et al., 2012; 22367537, Pugh et al., 2013; 23334666, Cheung and Dyer, 2013; 23702928). Low_grade gliomas with both IDH1/2 mutation and ATRX mutation are associated with worse prognosis than those with IDH1/2 mutation but no ATRX mutation (Haberler and W\u00f6hrer, 2014; 24559763). Loss of ATRX protein expression has been reported in 33_39% of incidences of leiomyosarcoma (LMS) associating with ALT, a poor prognostic factor across all LMS subtypes, and with poor prognosis in extrauterine LMS but not in uterine LMS (Singhi et al., 2015; USCAP Abstract 93)(Liau et al., 2015; 25229770). No targeted therapies are available to directly address ATRX inactivation. Based on preclinical (Liang et al., 2020; 31551363, Garbarino et al., 2021; 34118569) and limited clinical data (Cole et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT059), ATRX alterations may confer sensitivity to combination strategies involving WEE1 inhibition. In a Phase 2 study evaluating the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib plus irinotecan for the treatment of pediatric patients with neuroblastoma, prolonged SD was reported for 44% (4/9) of patients with ATRX_deficient tumors and responses were seen in two tumors that had evidence of ALT (Cole et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT059). Preclinical evidence also suggests that ATRX deficiency may impart sensitivity to synthetic lethal approaches involving PARP inhibition and irinotecan (George et al., 2020; 32846370), combined PARP and ATR inhibition (Garbarino et al., 2021; 34118569), or double_strand break_induction with agents such as doxorubicin, irinotecan, and topotecan (Koschmann et al., 2016; 26936505); however, these approaches have not been demonstrated clinically. ATRX mutations often co_occur with IDH1/2 mutations and may be indicative of Grade 2_3 astrocytoma or secondary glioblastoma (GBM) (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022)(Louis et al., 2016; 27157931, Weller et al., 2020; 33293629).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "EPHB4", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "true", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "EPHB4 encodes a member of the EPH family of receptor tyrosine kinases (Noren et al., 2007; 17483308). Ephrin signaling has been implicated in multiple processes, including cell adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, and cell migration (Pasquale, 2008; 18394988), and signaling between EPHB4 and its ligand EphrinB2 is particularly important for angiogenesis (Salvucci and Tosato, 2012; 22588055, Pitulescu and Adams, 2010; 21078817). EPHB receptors, including EPHB4, have been shown to undergo dysregulation (amplification, mutation, under_ or overexpression) in a number of different cancer types (Pasquale, 2010; 20179713). EPHB4 amplification has been reported in several solid tumor types (Hasina et al., 2013; 23100466, Boberg et al., 2013; 23063927, Masood et al., 2006; 16615113, Sinha et al., 2006; 17043250, Cromer et al., 2004; 14676830) and was associated with advanced disease stage in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (Sinha et al., 2006; 17043250).

In several of these studies, increased EPHB4 expression has been associated with clinicopathologic features, including disease stage (Sinha et al., 2006; 17043250, Li and Zhao, 2013; 23079712, Wu et al., 2004; 15029258, Alam et al., 2008; 18231102, Kumar et al., 2007; 17353927, Alam et al., 2009; 19356789, Zheng et al., 2012; 22684742, Li et al., 2014; 25148033), histological grade (Hasina et al., 2013; 23100466, Wu et al., 2004; 15029258, Takai et al., 2001; 11295082, Tu et al., 2012; 22374425), and hormone receptor status (Huang et al., 2015; 26191333, Dong et al., 2017; 28454369). High EPHB4 expression has been associated with inferior survival in multivariate analyses for patients with CRC treated with bevacizumab [hazard ratio (HR) = 5.95] (Guijarro_Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2013; 23579861), HNSCC (HR = 2.95) (Yavrouian et al., 2008; 18794445), epithelial ovarian cancer (HR = 4.53) (Pradeep et al., 2015; 26481148), or glioma (HR = 3.21) (Tu et al., 2012; 22374425). There are no approved therapies available to target EPHB4 alterations in cancer. sEPHB4 is a soluble monomeric extracellular domain of EPHB4 that functions as an antagonist of EphrinB2_EPHB4 interaction (Kertesz et al., 2006; 16322467), and fusion of sEPHB4 with human serum albumin (HSA) increases its stability (Shi et al., 2012; 22411527). Recombinant sEPHB4_HSA is under investigation in clinical trials. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that sEPHB4_HSA inhibits cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth, including for cells expressing cancer_associated EPHB4 mutants or overexpressing wild_type EPHB4 (Kertesz et al., 2006; 16322467, Li et al., 2014; 25148033, Liu et al., 2013; 23721559, Bhatia et al., 2016; 27941840, Scehnet et al., 2009; 18836096, Ferguson et al., 2015; 26073592). In addition, small_molecule inhibitors targeting multiple tyrosine kinases including EPHB4, such as JI_101 and XL647, have been under preclinical and clinical investigation (Werner et al., 2015; 26365907, Pietanza et al., 2012; 22011666, Pietanza et al., 2012; 22722787).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "FGF14", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "FGF14 encodes an intracellular non_secretory fibroblast growth factor that plays roles in neural development (Smallwood et al., 1996; 8790420, Zhang et al., 2012; 23233218).

FGF6 expression has been observed in several cancers (Iida et al., 1992; 1549352, Ropiquet et al., 2000; 10945637, Niini et al., 2002; 12399964) and was shown to be oncogenic in preclinical models (Marics et al., 1989; 2649847, Iida et al., 1992; 1549352). FGF6 has been reported as amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210) and may be biologically relevant in this context (Zack et al., 2013; 24071852, Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). Somatic alterations affecting FGF6 are infrequently documented, with the highest rates reported in penile cancer (4%), cutaneous melanoma (1_3%), stomach carcinoma (1_3%) and colorectal cancer (1%) (cBioPortal, COSMIC, 2023)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Amplification of FGF6 has been frequently observed in testicular germ cell cancer (5%) and ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (5%), and in 2_6% of lower_grade gliomas, glioblastomas, sarcomas, breast invasive carcinomas, uterine carcinosarcomas, lung squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), head and neck SCC, pancreatic adenocarcinomas, and esophageal carcinomas (cBioPortal, 2023) (Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). FGF6 is co_localized with FGF23 and CCND2 at chromosomal locus 12p13 and has been reported to be co_amplified with these genes in 1.3% of patients with breast cancer (Parish et al., 2015; 25950492). FGF6 expression has been reported in 54% (14/26) of prostate cancer samples, which also frequently express FGFR4 (Ropiquet et al., 2000; 10945637).

KDM5A overexpression alters the transcriptional regulation of cell cycle genes, including CCND1, and a variety of cyclin_dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs), including CDKN1A, CDKN1B, and CDKN2A, and results in cell cycle progression (Zeng et al., 2010; 19850045, Teng et al., 2013; 23722541, Liang et al., 2013; 23922798, Jiping et al., 2013; 23794145, Vieira et al., 2014; 24200674, Li et al., 2014; 24716659). Additionally, elevated KDM5A expression and associated chromatin remodeling has been implicated in resistance to various tyrosine kinase inhibitors in vitro, including erlotinib and gefitinib (Sharma et al., 2010; 20371346, Dannenberg et al., 2010; 20371339, Hou et al., 2012; 22937203).

Elevated levels of KDM5A expression have also been reported in a range of solid tumor types (Hou et al., 2012; 22937203, Liang et al., 2013; 23922798, Teng et al., 2013; 23722541, Paolicchi et al., 2013; 23266085, Vieira et al., 2014; 24200674, Li et al., 2014; 24716659), and fusion of KDM5A to NUP98 has been documented in acute myeloid leukemia (van Zutven et al., 2006; 16419055, Wang et al., 2009; 19430464). KDM5A expression is significantly correlated with HIF_1alpha and VEGF expression, as well as tumor size, angiogenesis, and poor patient prognosis in lung cancer (Qi et al., 2014; 25162518). There are no targeted therapies available to directly address genomic alterations in KDM5A. However, multiple preclinical studies have identified potential targets in KDM5A amplified or activated cells that may respond to therapy. KDM5A_mediated chromatin remodeling induces CCND1 expression and represses CDKI expression (Zeng et al., 2010; 19850045, Teng et al., 2013; 23722541, Liang et al., 2013; 23922798, Jiping et al., 2013; 23794145, Vieira et al., 2014; 24200674); therefore, KDM5A activation or amplification may sensitize cells to CDK4/CDK6 inhibitors. Drug_resistant cell populations, characterized by elevated KDM5A expression, responded to histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition (Sharma et al., 2010; 20371346), suggesting that HDAC inhibitors may be a potential therapeutic option. KDM5A also induces expression of VEGF and promotes angiogenesis, oncogenic transformation, and tumorigenesis, which can be inhibited by KDM5A knockdown (Li et al., 2014; 24716659, Qi et al., 2014; 25162518), suggesting that tumors harboring KDM5A amplification may be sensitive to angiogenesis inhibitors, including kinase inhibitors that target the VEGF receptors, such as sunitinib, sorafenib, vandetanib, ponatinib, cabozantinib, regorafenib, pazopanib, and axitinib. However, these inhibitors have yet to be extensively tested in the context of KDM5A amplification or activation; therefore, it is not known if these therapeutic strategies are relevant.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "MSH3", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "rearrangement intron 20", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "rearrangement intron 20"}}, "Interpretation": "MSH3 encodes a DNA mismatch repair protein. Two MutS homolog (MSH) complexes, MSH2_MSH6 (MutS_alpha) and MSH2_MSH3 (MutS_beta), are responsible for recognition of mismatched bases (van Oers et al., 2013; 24013230). MSH3 and MutS_beta has also been shown to participate in double_strand break repair by homologous recombination (van Oers et al., 2014; 24013230, Dietlein et al., 2014; 24556366). MSH3 loss of function has been linked to the production of tetranucleotide microsatellite frameshift mutations termed EMAST (elevated microsatellite alterations at selected tetranucleotide repeats) (Haugen et al., 2008; 18922920, Lee at al., 2010; 20708618). The presence of EMAST has been recognized as a biomarker in multiple solid cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI) (Watson et al., 2014; 24691426). Inactivating MSH3 mutations found in cancer tend to be frameshift, missense, or allelic loss (Kim et al., 2013; 24209623, Ohmiya et al., 2001; 11470537, Laghi et al., 2012; 22496206, Plaschke et al., 2004; 14871813). Certain germline polymorphisms in MSH3 have been reported to increase the risk of various cancers including colorectal (CRC) (Miao et al., 2015; 26617824, Morak et al., 2017; 28528517, Duraturo et al., 2011; 21128252, Reeves et al., 2012; 21974800, Berndt et al., 2007; 17205513), breast (Miao et al., 2015; 26617824, Yang et al., 2015; 25927356), esophageal (Vogelsang et al., 2012; 22623965), prostate (Jafary et al., 2012; 23464402, Hirata et al., 2008; 18355840, Miao et al., 2015; 26617824), gastric (Ohmiya et al., 2001; 11470537), and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (Nogueira et al., 2015; 25598504). Inactivating germline polymorphisms have been associated with hereditary colorectal adenomatous polyposis (Adam et al., 2016; 27476653). MSH3 mutations have been reported with the highest incidence in endometrial (9.0%), stomach (3.6%), skin (3.4%), and CRC (1.9%) (cBioPortal, 2023)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). MSH3 loss has been reported with the highest incidence in ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (3.3%), prostate adenocarcinoma (2.6%), and esophageal adenocarcinoma (1.1%) (cBioPortal, 2023)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). MSH3 loss has been correlated with the late development and progression of a variety of sporadic cancers including lung, ovarian, bladder, breast, and colorectal tumors (Edelmann et al., 2000; 10706084, Plaschke et al., 2012; 22249440, Benachenhou et al., 1998; 9650548, Kawakami et al., 2004; 15541380, Benachenhou et al., 1999; 10098729, Plaschke et al., 2004; 14871813). Consistent with this observation, studies have suggested that MSH3 loss increases chromosomal instability in p53_driven tumor models (van Oers et al., 2013; 24013230). Certain germline polymorphisms in MSH3 have been associated with poor prognosis in CRC (Plaschke et al., 2004; 14871813), HNSCC (Nogueira et al., 2015; 25598504), non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Xu et al., 2015; 25966119), and pancreatic cancer (Dong et al., 2011; 21212431). However, in one study of patients with MLH1_deficient CRC, MSH3 loss was associated with improved post_surgery outcome (Laghi et al., 2012; 22496206).

However, preclinical studies in the context of MSH3_deficient cancer cells have demonstrated antitumor efficacy of DNA_PKcs inhibitors (Dietlein et al., 2014; 24556366) and PARP inhibitors such as olaparib (Takahashi et al., 2011; 21285347) and have shown increased chemosensitivity to cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and SN_38 (Park et al., 2013; 23724141, Takahashi et al., 2011; 21285347).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947).

Low_level MSI has been reported in 5_9% of glioblastoma (GBM) samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927, Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285, Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). A large_scale study did not find high_level microsatellite instability (MSI_H) in any of 129 GBM samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), although a small_scale study reported MSI_H in 4 of 15 pediatric GBMs and 1 of 12 adult GBMs (Szybka et al., 2003; 12908754). The frequency of MSI has been reported to be increased in relapsed compared to primary GBM (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), in GBMs with a previous lower grade astrocytoma (Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285), and in giant cell GBM compared to classic GBM (Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255).

Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 mutations have been reported in 18_40% of astrocytoma samples, and preferentially in anaplastic astrocytoma; one study reported TP53 loss of function and partially/fully functional mutations in 15% and 25% of anaplastic astrocytomas, respectively (Uno et al., 2005; 15914282, Uno et al., 2006; 16711514, Lass et al., 2012; 22844452, Faria et al., 2012; 23009112, Milinkovic et al., 2013; 24358143, Galatro et al., 2013; 23613880). Some studies suggest that the presence of a TP53 mutation is correlated with a favorable prognosis in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) (Schmidt et al., 2002; 11939587). One study reported that TP53 alterations were associated with poorer OS (12.9 months altered vs. 19.7 months wildtype, HR=1.58, p=0.0054) in IDH_wildtype GBM (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Mutation of TP53 is thought to be an early step in the tumorigenesis of astrocytomas, which can progress into anaplastic astrocytoma and then glioblastoma through gain of other genetic abnormalities such as loss of CDKN2A or RB1, followed by loss of PTEN (Nozaki et al., 1999; 11550308). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "04", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "04"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Touat et al., 2020; 32322066, Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556, Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642). Anaplastic astrocytoma harbors a median TMB of 1.8 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 2% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). For pediatric patients, high TMB has been reported in a subset of high_grade gliomas, frequently in association with mutations in mismatch repair or proofreading genes and in TP53, whereas BRAF alterations or other oncogene fusions were observed more frequently in brain tumors harboring low TMB (Patel et al., 2020; 32386112, Johnson et al., 2017; 28912153). Increased TMB has been reported to correlate with higher tumor grade in glioma (Draaisma et al., 2015; 26699864) and glioblastoma (GBM) tissue samples with biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD) (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570), as well as with shorter OS of patients with diffuse glioma (Wang et al., 2020; 32164609). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In glioma, a lack of association between TMB and clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors has been reported (Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Touat et al., 2020; 32322066). However, multiple case studies have reported that patients with ultramutated gliomas driven by POLE mutations have benefited from treatment with anti_PD_1 (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556) or anti_PD_L1 (Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642) therapies. Therefore, although increased TMB alone may not be a strong biomarker for PD_1 or PD_L1 inhibitors in this cancer type, these agents may have efficacy for patients with glioma harboring both high TMB and POLE mutation.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene":
