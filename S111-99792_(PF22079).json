Alterations such as seen here may disrupt BRCA1 function or expression (Nelson et al., 2010; 20681793, Silver and Livingston, 2012; 22843421, Ludwig et al., 2001; 11358863). BRCA1 mutations have been reported in 0_2% (1/51) of cholangiocarcinoma cases in several small sequencing studies, while BRCA1 genomic loss was not detected (cBio_Chan_On et al., 2013; 24185513, cBio_Ong et al., 2012; 22561520, cBio_Jiao et al., 2013; 24185509). BRCA1 mutation has also been reported in one of 28 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas in one study (Ross et al., 2014; 24563076). BRCA1 mutations have been reported in 2.0% of biliary tract carcinomas analyzed in COSMIC, including in 2.8% of gallbladder adenocarcinoma cases (Jan 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). In a study of pancreatobiliary cancers in Irish families with pathogenic BRCA variants, biliary tract cancer was reported in 1.7% of BRCA1_positive pedigrees (Power et al., 2021; 32918181). A case study reported 1 patient with gallbladder carcinoma harboring a confirmed BRCA1 germline mutation (Xie et al., 2016; 28028375). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of BRCA1 mutations in biliary tract carcinomas are limited (PubMed, Nov 2021). Alterations that inactivate BRCA1 or BRCA2 may confer sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Kaufman et al., 2015; 25366685, Mateo et al., 2015; 26510020, Tutt et al., 2010; 20609467, Robson et al., 2017; 28578601, Mirza et al., 2016; 27717299, Sandhu et al., 2013; 23810788, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594, Drew et al., 2016; 27002934, Pujade_Lauraine et al., 2017; 28754483, Ledermann et al., 2016; 27617661, Fong et al., 2009; 19553641, Audeh et al., 2010; 20609468, Fong et al., 2010; 20406929, Gelmon et al., 2011; 21862407, Kaye et al., 2012; 22203755, Domchek et al., 2016; 26723501, Moore et al., 2018; 30345884, Golan et al., 2019; 31157963) or ATR inhibitors (Yap et al., 2020; 32988960, Thomas et al., 2018; 29252124, O Carrigan et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2504, Yap et al., 2016; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract 1LBA, Saito et al., 2018; 31299005). Clinical responses to PARP inhibitors have been reported for patients with either germline or somatic BRCA1/2 mutations (Mateo et al., 2015; 26510020, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594, Ledermann et al., 2016; 27617661, Moore et al., 2018; 30345884, Golan et al., 2019; 31157963) and for patients with platinum_resistant or _refractory disease (Fong et al., 2010; 20406929, Kaufman et al., 2015; 25366685, Sandhu et al., 2013; 23810788, Domchek et al., 2016; 26723501). In a Phase 1 trial of monotherapy treatment with the ATR inhibitor BAY1895344, 2 patients with deleterious BRCA1 alterations and platinum_refractory ovarian carcinoma experienced a PR or prolonged SD (Yap et al., 2020; 32988960). In other Phase 1 trials of combination approaches, a patient with BRCA1_mutated ovarian carcinoma experienced prolonged SD from the ATR inhibitor berzosertib combined with topotecan (Thomas et al., 2018; 29252124); another patient with platinum_ and PARP_inhibitory refractory ovarian cancer and an inactivating germline BRCA1 mutation experienced a PR from berzosertib plus carboplatin (O Carrigan et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2504); and a third patient with BRCA1_mutated triple_negative breast cancer (TNBC) experienced a PR to the ATR inhibitor ceralasertib combined with olaparib (Yap et al., 2016; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract 1LBA). Preclinical studies of BRCA1/2 inactivation in T_cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T_ALL) (Pouliot et al., 2019; 31721781), ovarian carcinoma (Kim et al., 2017; 27993965), and TNBC (Jin et al., 2018; 29605721) showing reduced cell viability and increased DNA damage during ATR treatment further support the sensitivity of BRCA1_deficient cells to ATR inhibitors. The WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib has been evaluated as a monotherapy and in combination with PARP_inhibitor, olaparib. In a Phase 2 study for patients with PARP_resistant ovarian cancer, the combination of olaparib and adavosertib elicited improved clinical benefit (ORR: 29%; DCR: 89%) compared to adavosertib alone (ORR: 23%; DCR: 63%); however, in the BRCA_mutated cohort, no significant difference in clinical benefit was observed between the combination (ORR: 19%) and monotherapy (ORR: 20%) treatments (Westin et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 5505). In a Phase 1 monotherapy trial of adavosertib that included 9 patients with BRCA1/2_mutated solid tumors, 2 patients with BRCA1_mutated cancers (1 with ovarian serous carcinoma and 1 with oral squamous cell carcinoma) achieved PRs, and a third patient with ovarian serous carcinoma harboring mutations in BRCA1 and TP53 experienced 14% tumor shrinkage prior to disease progression (Do et al., 2015; 25964244). Inactivation of BRCA1 may also predict sensitivity to the DNA_damaging agents trabectedin and lurbinectedin (Cruz et al., 2018; 30240327, Awada et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 1072, Poveda et al., 2017; 28368437, Garcia et al., 2013; 23364677, Sch\u00f6ffski et al., 2011; 21376569, Aracil et al., 2014; Abstract 35, Italiano et al., 2011; 21287534, Laroche_Clary et al., 2015; 25602962, Ghouadni et al., 2017; 28467918, Tedesco et al., 2011; ASCO Abstract 1125, Monk et al., 2015; 25722380, Monk et al., 2020; 31924332, Yasui et al., 2016; 27077926). One or more of the BRCA1 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (ClinVar, Mar 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Inactivating germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 are associated with autosomal dominant hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (Miki et al., 1994; 7545954, Wooster et al., 1995; 8524414), and the lifetime risk of breast and ovarian cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers has been estimated to be as high as 87% and 44%, respectively (Ford et al., 1994; 7907678). Elevated risk for other cancer types, including gastric, pancreatic, prostate, and colorectal, has also been identified, with an increase in risk ranging from 20 to 60% (Friedenson, 2005; 16369438). The estimated prevalence of deleterious germline BRCA1/2 mutations in the general population is between 1:400 and 1:800, with an approximately 10_fold higher prevalence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (Ford et al., 1994; 7907678, Whittemore et al., 1997; 9042908, Claus et al., 1996; 8635102, Struewing et al., 1997; 9145676, Oddoux et al., 1996; 8841192, King et al., 2003; 14576434, Hall et al., 2009; 19241424).

Rucaparib has primarily been evaluated in the context of ovarian carcinoma, breast carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, and melanoma. In a Phase 2 study of rucaparib for recurrent, platinum_sensitive ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma, median PFS was significantly longer in patients with BRCA1/2 mutations (12.8 months) or high loss of heterozygosity (LOH; 5.7 months) compared to patients with low LOH (5.2 months). Objective responses were observed for 80% (32/40) of patients with BRCA1/2 mutations, for 29% (24/82) with high LOH, and for 10% (7/10) with low LOH (Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). In heavily pretreated patients with a germline BRCA1/2 mutation who had received 2_4 prior chemotherapy treatments and had a progression free interval of greater than 6 months, 65% (17/26) of patients achieved an objective response with rucaparib treatment (Shapira_Frommer et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5513). In a Phase 2 study evaluating rucaparib for patients with advanced breast or ovarian cancer and germline BRCA1/2 mutations, disease control was observed in 92% (12/13) of patients with ovarian cancer treated with oral rucaparib dosed continuously, but no objective responses were reported in breast cancer patients (n=23). However, 39% (9/23) of evaluable patients with breast cancer achieved SD lasting 12 weeks or more (Drew et al., 2016; 27002934). In a Phase 1 study of rucaparib treatment in patients with solid tumors, 3/4 patients with ovarian cancer and 1/1 patient with breast cancer given the recommended Phase 2 dose reported objective responses; all responders harbored BRCA1/2 mutations (Kristeleit et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 2573). A Phase 2 study of rucaparib treatment for patients with relapsed pancreatic cancer reported 1/19 CR, 2/19 PR (one unconfirmed) and 4/19 SD.

Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. Somatic CHEK2 mutations have been reported in 0_3% of various solid tumors, with the highest incidence reported in endometrial, urothelial, and skin tumors (COSMIC, Jan 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). In breast cancer, certain CHEK2 mutations are associated with higher grade and larger tumors as well as bilateral disease (Kilpivaara et al., 2005; 15472904). A study reported that a polymorphism in CHEK2 was associated with worse survival of patients with GBM, but this association lost significance after adjusting for other prognostic factors (Simon et al., 2006; 17016233, Dong et al., 2014; 24532427).

Clinical benefit has been observed for patients with ovarian (Swisher et al., 2017; 27908594, O Malley et al., 2017; AACR Abstract LB_A12) and testicular (Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006) cancers treated with PARP inhibitors. In a study of patients with metastatic breast cancer, 8 patients with CHEK2 mutation did not respond to olaparib treatment (Tung et al., 2020; 33119476). One study of patients with breast cancer reported that carriers of the CHEK2 H371Y mutation have a higher likelihood of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Liu et al., 2015; 25884806), whereas another study found that those who carry CHEK2 mutations have a lower frequency of objective clinical responses to neoadjuvant therapy (Pfeifer et al., 2014; 25414026). A third study reported that the CHEK2 1100delC mutation is not associated with differential efficacy of chemotherapy and endocrine therapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer (Kriege et al., 2015; 25958056). It is not known whether these therapeutic approaches would be relevant in the context of alterations that have not been fully characterized, as seen here. Germline CHEK2 mutation has been associated with cancer susceptibility of low to moderate penetrance, especially in hereditary breast cancer (Mahdavi et al., 2019; 30552672). CHEK2 germline mutation has been identified in approximately 2.5% of familial or high_risk breast cancer cases (Kleiblov\u00e1 et al., 2019; 31409080, Hauke et al., 2018; 29522266). Although heterozygous germline CHEK2 mutation increases breast cancer risk two_ to three_fold, it is not associated with younger age at diagnosis (Hauke et al., 2018; 29522266, Lu et al., 2019; 30128536). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of CHEK2 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors may detect nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "On the basis of clinical evidence in prostate and other solid cancers, CHEK2 loss or inactivation may confer sensitivity to PARP inhibitors.

LKB1 acts as a tumor suppressor in cancer, as loss of function promotes proliferation and tumorigenesis (Carretero et al., 2010; 20541700, Ollila et al., 2011; 21926085). Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. STK11 mutations have been reported in 3% of biliary tract carcinomas analyzed in the COSMIC database (Mar 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). STK11 mutation or loss have also been reported in biliary tract adenocarcinomas in the literature (Olschwang et al., 2001; 11389158, Su et al., 1999; 10362809, Sahin et al., 2003; 12861065). Loss of STK11 protein expression in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma has been reported as an independent predictor of shorter OS and time to recurrence (Wang et al., 2015; 26056085). Increased mTOR signaling is present in LKB1_deficient tumors, suggesting therapies targeting mTOR may be relevant for tumors with STK11 alterations (Shaw et al., 2004; 15261145, Ji et al., 2007; 17676035, Contreras et al., 2008; 18245476, Gurumurthy et al., 2008; 18172296, Shackelford et al., 2009; 19541609). Case studies have reported PRs for 2 patients with STK11_mutated pancreatic cancer following treatment with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (Kl\u00fcmpen et al., 2011; 21189378, Moreira et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 315), with 1 PR observed in a PJS patient for 9 months until progression (Kl\u00fcmpen et al., 2011; 21189378). However, retrospective analysis of a Phase 2 trial for patients with endometrial carcinoma found LKB1 (STK11) protein levels were not significantly correlated with response to everolimus treatment (Tredan et al., 2013; 23238879). In one preclinical study, STK11 loss was associated with sensitivity to combination treatment including an SRC inhibitor (Carretero et al., 2010; 20541700); however, the clinical relevance of these findings has not been established. It is not known whether these therapeutic approaches would be relevant in the context of alterations that have not been fully characterized, as seen here. STK11 alteration is associated with poorer response to immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with NSCLC, including those with tumors harboring co_occurring KRAS mutation (Skoulidis et al., 2018; 29773717, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Scheel et al., 2016; 27467949, Skoulidis et al., 2015; 26069186, Koyama et al., 2016; 26833127, Schabath et al., 2016; 26477306, Dong et al., 2017; 28039262, Kadara et al., 2017; 27687306, Herter_Sprie et al., 2016; 27699275) (Skoulidis et al., 2017; IASLC 17th World Congress on Lung Cancer Abstract MA04.07, Jure_Kunkel et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 3028, Stephens, 2017; AACR Abstract SY40_02, Skoulidis et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 11002, Skoulidis et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 11002). One or more of the STK11 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Peutz_Jeghers syndrome (ClinVar, Mar 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in STK11 underlie Peutz_Jeghers syndrome (PJS), a rare autosomal dominant disorder associated with a predisposition for tumor formation (Amos et al., 2004; 15121768). This disorder has an estimated frequency between 1:29,000 and 1:120,000, although reported rates in the literature vary greatly (Hearle et al., 2006; 16707622, Amos et al., 2004; 15121768, van der Groep et al., 2011; 21336636). Although gastrointestinal tumors are the most common malignancies associated with PJS, patients also exhibit an 18_fold increased risk of developing other epithelial cancers (Hearle et al., 2006; 16707622, Amos et al., 2004; 15121768, van der Groep et al., 2011; 21336636), and individuals with this syndrome have a 30_50% risk of developing breast cancer (Amos et al., 2004; 15121768, van der Groep et al., 2011; 21336636). Given the association with PJS, in the appropriate clinical context testing for the presence of germline mutations in STK11 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Increased mTOR signaling is present in LKB1_deficient tumors, suggesting therapies targeting mTOR may be relevant for tumors with STK11 alterations.

High bTMB levels were not detected in this sample. It is unclear whether the bTMB levels in this sample would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Depending on the clinical context, TMB testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. Average bTMB levels in solid tumors other than NSCLC have not been evaluated (cBioPortal, COSMIC, PubMed, Mar 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of bTMB levels in biliary tract cancer are limited (PubMed, Jul 2022). Although cases with hypermutated biliary tract cancer were enriched in a subgroup with poor prognosis in 1 study (Nakamura et al., 2015; 26258846), TMB_high (\u226510 mut/Mb) status in biliary adenocarcinoma not treated with immunotherapy was not significantly associated with OS in another study, in which patients with TMB_high tumors experienced numerically longer OS compared with patients with TMB_low tumors (11.5 vs. 8.4 months, adjusted HR=0.65) (Shao et al., 2020; 33119110). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB) may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716), anti_PD_1 (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716), and anti_PD_1/CTLA4 therapies (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P). A Phase 2 multi_solid_tumor trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022). In non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single_agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 Muts/Mb_16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Cannot Be Determined", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Cannot Be Determined"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI_H is infrequent in cholangiocarcinoma, reported in 1% of samples (Javle et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 4087). A non_zero level of MSI has been reported in 18_49% of cholangiocarcinoma cases (Momoi et al., 2001; 11580146, Limpaiboon et al., 2002; 12175538, Liu et al., 2002; 12402306, Liengswangwong et al., 2003; 14506736), although the studies did not specify what fraction of cases were MSI_H. A higher frequency of MSI (63%) was reported in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma associated with exposure to Thorotrast (Liu et al., 2002; 12402306). One study reported that MSI is associated with poor prognosis in liver fluke_related cholangiocarcinoma (Limpaiboon et al., 2002; 12175538).

The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with elevated tumor fraction values have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus high sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at low risk of false negative results. However, if elevated tumor fraction is not detected, it does not exclude the presence of disease burden or compromise the confidence of reported alterations. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels.
