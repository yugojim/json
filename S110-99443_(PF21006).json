These kinases function downstream of RAS as part of the MAPK (RAF_MEK_ERK) signaling cascade that facilitates cell proliferation, survival and transformation (Holderfield et al., 2014; 24957944, Burotto et al., 2014; 24948110). BRAF mutations have been reported in up to 20% of all cancers, with the majority of mutations occurring at the V600 position (Davies et al., 2002; 12068308, Kandoth et al., 2013; 24132290). Among the V600 mutations, V600E accounts for 70_80% of observations, V600K for 10_30%, and V600R for 5_7%, with V600D comprising the majority of the rest (Davies et al., 2002; 12068308, Greaves et al., 2013; 23273605, Klein et al., 2013; 23237741). Mutations at V600 have been shown to constitutively activate BRAF kinase and hyperactivate the downstream MEK_ERK signaling, promoting oncogenic transformation (Wellbrock et al., 2004; 15059882, Davies et al., 2002; 12068308). In multiple cancer types, multiple mutations at V600, including V600E, V600K, V600R, V600D, and V600M exhibited sensitivity to V600_targeted therapies (Hauschild et al., 2012; 22735384, McArthur et al., 2014; 24508103, Fisher et al., 2012; 22904646, Yang et al., 2010; 20551065, Gentilcore et al., 2013; 23317446, Klein et al., 2013; 23237741, van den Brom et al., 2013; 23473613, Klein et al., 2013; 23490649, Ponti et al., 2013; 23463675, Ponti et al., 2012; 23031422, Parakh et al., 2015; 25382067, Lee et al., 2017; 28194436); other mutations at this position are predicted to behave similarly. Expression of the BRAF kinase domain without the N_terminal auto_inhibitory domain, whether with or without a fusion partner, has been shown to be constitutively active and shown to drive hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway, exhibiting transforming activity (Seivert et al., 2013; 23533272, Pouliakos et al., 2011; 22113612, Botton et al., 2013; 23890088, Ciampi et al., 2005; 15630448, Cin et al., 2011; 21424530, Dahiya et al., 2012; 22548077, Lin et al., 2012; 22157620, Tian et al., 2011; 21884820, Forshew et al., 2009; 19373855, Jones et al., 2008; 18974108, Tran et al., 2005; 15710605, Baitei et al., 2009; 19156774, Gronych et al., 2011; 21403401), in a manner sensitive to MEK inhibitors (Chmielecki et al., 2014; 25266736, Hutchinson et al., 2013; 24345920, Rizos et al., 2014; 24463458, Hartsough et al., 2014; 24520098, Carlino et al., 2014; 24476679, Baitei et al., 2009; 19156774), ERK inhibitors (Carlino et al., 2014; 24476679), pan_RAF inhibitor sorafenib (Botton et al., 2013; 23890088, Gronych et al., 2011; 21403401), and second generation BRAF inhibitors PLX8394 and PLX7904 (Choi et al., 2014; 24283590, Basile et al., 2014; 24422853). Expression of BRAF variants lacking the autoinhibitory region (including variants lacking exons 2_8, 2_10, 4_8, or 4_10) has been reported as an acquired or, rarely, pre_treatment mechanism of resistance to vemurafenib (observed in 9/27 patients who progressed on treatment) and dabrafenib (6/22 cases) in melanoma patients with BRAF V600 mutations (Rizos et al., 2014; 24463458, Poulikakos et al., 2011; 22113612). In cell_based studies, expression of similar BRAF variants also leads to resistance to vemurafenib (Poulikakos et al., 2011; 22113612, Basile et al., 2014; 24422853, Hartsough et al., 2014; 24520098, Basile et al., 2013; 24121492). This tumor harbors a BRAF rearrangement that results in deletion of the N_terminal autoinhibitory region. BRAF fusions have been infrequently reported in colorectal cancer, with an incidence of <1% of cases (Ross et al., 2016; 26314551, Yoshihara et al., 2014; 25500544). BRAF mutations have been reported in approximately 5_19% of colorectal cancer samples (De Roock et al., 2011; 21163703, Di Nicolantonio et al., 2008; 19001320, Dienstmann et al., 2012; 22723336, Safaee et al., 2012; 23056577, Guedes et al., 2013; 23548132). BRAF V600E is a strong adverse prognostic marker in colorectal cancer (NCCN Colon Cancer Guidelines, v2.2021). BRAF mutations have been associated with poor prognosis and shorter survival in patients with colorectal cancer, particularly those with metastatic disease, as well as with smoking history (Sinicrope et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract 3514, Hassabo et al., 2014; ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium Abstract 473) (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Bokemeyer et al., 2012; 22446022, Gavin et al., 2012; 23045248, Laurent_Puig et al., 2009; 19884556, Ogino et al., 2012; 22147942, Roth et al., 2010; 20008640, Douillard et al., 2013; 24024839, Hsu et al., 2016; 26989027). Analysis of individual BRAF mutations in 2127 patients with advanced colorectal cancer treated with chemotherapy with or without cetuximab revealed that BRAF V600E associated with poor prognosis (HR 2.60, P=1.0e_15, with median reduction of survival being 320 days) and distinct clinicopathological features, including correlation with increased peritoneal metastases compared to BRAF wild_type tumors (24% vs. 12%, P=0.0015), while BRAF D594G inactivating mutation was not prognostic (HR 1.30, P=0.37) and had similar clinicopathologic features as BRAF wild_type tumors (Summers et al., 2016; 27815357). Although case studies have reported that patients with parotid gland tumors and melanoma harboring BRAF rearrangements responded to regorafenib (Klempner et al., 2016; 26562024) and sorafenib (Passeron et al., 2011; 22092579) treatment, published data investigating the correlation between BRAF rearrangements and therapeutic benefit of pan_RAF inhibitors are limited; therefore, it is not known whether these agents would be beneficial in this case. BRAF V600 mutations activate MEK_ERK signaling and are associated with sensitivity to BRAF V600 mutation_specific inhibitors such as vemurafenib (McArthur et al., 2014; 24508103), dabrafenib (Hauschild et al., 2012; 22735384, Hauschild et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 10001), and encorafenib (Delord et al., 2017; 28611198); the combination of BRAF V600 mutation_selective inhibitors with MEK inhibitors such as encorafenib plus binimetinib (Dummer et al., 2018; 29573941), vemurafenib plus cobimetinib (Ascierto et al., 2016; 27480103, Ribas et al., 2020; 31732523, Klute et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 122), or dabrafenib plus trametinib (Long et al., 2015; 26037941, Long et al., 2017; 28475671, Robert et al., 2015; 25399551); MEK inhibitors such as trametinib (Flaherty et al., 2012; 22663011, Falchook et al., 2012; 22805292, Kim et al., 2013; 23248257, Hauschild et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 10001), cobimetinib (Larkin et al., 2014; 25265494), binimetinib (Ascierto et al., 2013; 23414587), and selumetinib (Banerjee et al., 2017; 28339824, Fangusaro et al., 2019; 31151904, Robert et al., 2013; 23735514); pan_RAF inhibitors such as sorafenib (Brose et al., 2009; DOI: 10.1200/jco.2009.27.15_suppl.6002, Ahmed et al., 2011; 21566072, Schneider et al., 2016; 26786320, Gautschi et al., 2015; 26200454); and ERK inhibitors (Morris et al., 2013; 23614898). For patients with BRAF V600_mutated CRC, single_agent BRAF inhibitors have shown limited clinical activity (Kopetz et al., 2010; ASCO Abstract 3534, Kopetz et al., 2015; 26460303, Dienstmann et al., 2012; 22723336, Falchook et al., 2012; 22608338, Hyman et al., 2015; 26287849). However, significant clinical benefit has been achieved with combinatorial approaches involving 2 or more of BRAF inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, and EGFR_targeting antibodies (Kopetz et al., 2019; 31566309, Van Cutsem et al., 2019; 30892987, Atreya et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 103, Hong et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 3511, Connolly et al., 2014; 24523613, Capalbo et al., 2014; 24755613, Hyman et al., 2015; 26287849, Yaeger et al., 2015; 25589621, van Geel et al., 2017; 28363909, Corcoran al., 2015; 26392102). However, the concurrent deletion of the BRAF autoinhibitory domain has been correlated with resistance to vemurafenib and dabrafenib in clinical studies (Rizos et al., 2014; 24463458, Poulikakos et al., 2011; 22113612), as well as in preclinical studies of vemurafenib (Poulikakos et al., 2011; 22113612, Basile et al., 2014; 24422853, Hartsough et al., 2014; 24520098, Basile et al., 2013; 24121492). MEK inhibitors (Rizos et al., 2014; 24463458, Hartsough et al., 2014; 24520098, Carlino et al., 2014; 24476679, Baitei et al., 2009; 19156774), ERK inhibitors (Carlino et al., 2014; 24476679), and second generation BRAF inhibitors PLX8394 and PLX7904 (Basile et al., 2014; 24422853) may therefore be more effective in this case. Clinical and preclinical data suggest that BRAF activating mutations or fusions may confer sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, such as trametinib (Flaherty et al., 2012; 22663011, Falchook et al., 2012; 22805292, Kim et al., 2013; 23248257, Bowyer et al., 2014; 24933606, Ross et al., 2015; 26314551, Menzies et al., 2015; 26072686, Lee et al., 2017; 28194436, Grisham et al., 2015; 26324360, Chmielecki et al., 2014; 25266736), selumetinib (Banerjee et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 10065, Banerjee et al., 2017; 28339824, Fangusaro et al., 2019; 31151904, Robert et al., 2013; 23735514), binimetinib (Ascierto et al., 2013; 23414587, Grisham et al., 2018; 29844129), and cobimetinib (Ribas et al., 2014; 25037139, Larkin et al., 2014; 25265494, Ashworth et al., 2014; 24616537); and ERK inhibitors (Morris et al., 2013; 23614898). Although Phase 2 and case studies of sorafenib in BRAF V600_mutated thyroid carcinoma have reported clinical responses (Brose et al., 2009; DOI: 10.1200/jco.2009.27.15_suppl.6002, Ahmed et al., 2011; 21566072, Schneider et al., 2016; 26786320), a patient with a BRAF V600E_mutated NSCLC achieved a PR to sorafenib (Gautschi et al., 2015; 26200454), and a case study has reported that a patient with BRAF_mutated GIST responded to regorafenib treatment (Nannini et al., 2020; 32647535). Another patient with BRAF_mutated GIST did not respond to regorafenib treatment (Ben_Ami et al., 2016; 27371698) and clinical studies in various other diseases have shown conflicting results regarding the correlation between BRAF V600 mutations and efficacy of sorafenib and other pan_RAF inhibitor, such as regorafenib (Tabernero et al., 2013; 23532888, Wilson et al., 2014; 24714776, Ott et al., 2010; 21206909, Amaravadi et al., 2009; 19996224, Flaherty et al., 2008; 18676756, Eisen et al., 2006; 16880785, Alzahrani et al., 2012; 22435913, Innocenti et al, 2020; DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2020.38.4_suppl.196, Lee et al., 2020; 33224274, Garcia_Alfonso et al., 2018; 30120161); therefore, it is not known whether these agents would be beneficial in this case. A BRAF autoinhibitory domain deletion emerged in a patient with BRAF V600E_mutated CRC during progression on cetuximab combined with vemurafenib and irinotecan (Tung et al., 2020; 32669268); therefore, it is unclear whether cetuximab combined with BRAF inhibitors would be beneficial here. Deletions within the BRAF autoinhibitory domain have been identified in 3 patients with V600_mutated melanoma who progressed on combination dabrafenib plus trametinib (Johnson et al., 2018; 29171936, Wagle et al., 2017; 24265154, Chen et al., 2016; 27124486) and in a fourth patient who relapsed on encorafenib plus binimetinib (Rizos et al., 2014; 24463458); therefore, it is unlikely that the combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors would be beneficial here. On the basis of extensive clinical data, BRAF V600 mutation does not generally associate with significant clinical benefit from addition of cetuximab or panitumumab to chemotherapy (NCCN Colon Cancer Guidelines, v2.2021) (Pietrantonio et al., 2015; 25673558, Rowland et al., 2015; 25989278, Van Custem et al., 2011; 21502544, Smith et al., 2013; 23741067, Douillard et al., 2013; 24024839, Karapetis et al., 2014; 24218517, Peeters et al., 2013; 23325582, Peeters et al., 2015; 26341920, Guren et al., 2017; 28399112, Seymour et al., 2013; 23725851). Low response rates to cetuximab or panitumumab monotherapy or combination with chemotherapy have been frequently observed among patients with BRAF V600_mutated CRC, although similarly low response rates in this patient population were also often observed to chemotherapy alone; additionally, response rates were generally lower for patients with BRAF_mutated tumors than for those whose tumors were BRAF_wild_type (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Peeters et al., 2013; 23325582, Seymour et al., 2013; 23725851, Karapetis et al., 2014; 24218517, Di Nicolantonio et al., 2008; 19001320, Stintzing et al., 2017; 28463756, Tol et al., 2009; 19571295). In a limited number of patients with CRC treated with cetuximab_ or panitumumab_containing chemotherapy regimens, BRAF V600E was found to be present at the time of progression (Freeman et al., 2008; 18621636, Gao et al., 2011; 23357879, Soeda et al., 2013; 22638623, Molinari et al., 2011; 21632860, Andre et al., 2013; 23041588, Benvenuti et al., 2007; 17363584), to be a mechanism of acquired (Arena et al., 2015; 25623215, Montagut et al., 2012; 22270724) or primary (Todelo et al., 2017; 27852040) resistance, or to be enriched in nonresponders versus responders (Molinari et al., 2011; 21632860). A Phase 1 trial of the ERK1/2 inhibitor ulixertinib reported PRs for 16% (3/19) of previously treated patients and 1 out of 2 newly diagnosed patients with BRAF V600E_mutant melanoma, 25% (3/12) of patients with BRAF_mutated lung cancer (2 with V600E and 1 with L597Q), and 19% (4/21) of patients with other BRAF_mutated cancers (2 with G469A, 1 with V600E, and 1 with L485W); 2 patients with BRAF V600E mutations also experienced CNS response (Sullivan et al., 2018; 29247021). BRAF inhibitors can induce adverse effects such as the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), keratoacanthomas, and new primary melanomas caused by inactivation of wild_type BRAF and leading to paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway (Gibney et al., 2013; 23712190, McArthur et al., 2014; 24508103, Hauschild et al., 2012; 22735384). Meta_analysis confirmed a reduced risk of developing cutaneous SCC with combined BRAF_ and MEK_inhibition relative to BRAF_inhibitor monotherapy (Peng et al., 2017; 2913734). A Phase 1/2 trial of PLX8394, a next_generation BRAF inhibitor predicted to not induce paradoxical MAPK pathway activation (Zhang et al., 2015; 26466569, Yao et al., 2019; 30559419), reported PRs in patients with BRAF V600E_mutant tumors, specifically in glioma (3/4), papillary thyroid carcinoma (1/9), colorectal cancer (1/10), and ovarian cancer (1/1)(Janku et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 2583).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "BRAF activating alterations may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of BRAF, MEK, or ERK.

Response rates to cetuximab or panitumumab, as monotherapies or in combination with chemotherapy, have generally been found to be low for patients with BRAF V600_mutated CRC; however, improved clinical benefit has been reported from combinations of these EGFR antibodies with BRAF inhibitors, alone or in combination with inhibitors of MEK or PI3K_alpha.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Trametinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Trametinib is a MEK inhibitor that is FDA approved as a monotherapy to treat patients with melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations.

Significant clinical responses to trametinib have been achieved by patients with melanoma harboring BRAF V600E (Falchook et al., 2012; 22805292, Kim et al., 2013; 23248257), V600K (Falchook et al., 2012; 22805292), V600R (Kim et al., 2013; 23248257), K601E (Bowyer et al., 2014; 24933606, Kim et al., 2013; 23248257), L597V (Falchook et al., 2012; 22805292), L597Q (Sullivan et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9537, Bowyer et al., 2014; 24933606), or L597S (Dahlman et al., 2012; 22798288) mutations; by a patient with histiocytosis harboring an activating N486_P490del alteration (Lee et al., 2017; 28194436); as well as by patients with tumors harboring BRAF fusions (Banerjee et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 10065, Ross et al., 2015; 26314551, Menzies et al., 2015; 26072686, Grisham et al., 2015; 26324360, Chmielecki et al., 2014; 25266736, Durham et al., 2019; 31768065). On the basis of emerging clinical evidence, activating alterations or amplification of MAP2K1 may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors such as trametinib. Patients with MAP2K1_mutated histiocytic neoplasms (Gounder et al., 2018; 29768143, Diamond et al., 2015; 26566875, Kumamoto et al., 2019; 30361829), MAP2K1_mutated hairy cell leukemia (Andritsos et al., 2016; ASH Abstract 5598), or MAP2K1_amplified triple_negative breast cancer (Parsons et al., 2016; 27489289) have benefited from treatment with trametinib. </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> Preclinical studies have reported that trametinib shows some activity in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells alone and enhances antitumor effects in cells treated with 5_fluorouracil (Yamaguchi et al., 2011; 21523318, Watanabe et al., 2013; 23438367). In addition, preclinical investigations have shown sensitivity to trametinib in cell lines with activating KRAS mutations in codons 12, 13, and 61 (Gilmartin et al., 2011; 21245089). Phase 1 and Phase 1b studies of trametinib, alone or in combination with gemcitabine, reported some activity in several types of solid tumors (Infante et al., 2013; 23583440, Infante et al., 2012; 22805291). However, Phase 1 monotherapy trials of RO4987655, another MEK inhibitor, have shown no responses and only 1 incidence of stable disease in 31 evaluable patients with CRC, including an expansion cohort of 24 patients with KRAS mutations (Leijen et al., 2012; 22767668, Zimmer et al., 2014; 24947927). In contrast, a trial of combination treatment with selumetinib (another MEK inhibitor) and irinotecan in patients with KRAS_mutated CRC reported confirmed partial responses (PR) in 3/31 (10%) patients, an unconfirmed PR in one patient (3%), and stable disease in 15/31 (48%) patients, improving upon historical clinical trial data of irinotecan single_agent treatment; longer progression_free survival compared to historical controls was also achieved (Hochster et al., 2013; ASCO GI Abstract 380). A Phase 1b trial of combination treatment with the MEK inhibitor MEK162 and the PI3K_alpha inhibitor BYL719 reported stable disease in 43% of patients with KRAS_mutated CRC, with responses independent of PIK3CA mutation status (Juric et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 9051). Another Phase 1b combination trial of trametinib and the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib in solid tumors observed ongoing partial responses in 2/28 (7%) of patients, including one patient with CRC harboring a NRAS Q61K mutation (Sullivan et al., 2015; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract PR06). Although the presence of a KRAS mutation in CRC has been associated with lack of efficacy to monotherapy MEK inhibitors (Infante et al., 2012; 22805291, Zimmer et al., 2014; 24947927, Bennouna et al., 2011; 20127139, Weekes et al., 2013; 23434733), the extent to which other alterations affecting this pathway, such as observed here, confers sensitivity to MEK inhibitors is unclear (Tsimberidou et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract e22086). Whereas frequent adverse events precluded a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for the combination of trametinib and everolimus in a Phase 1b trial for solid tumors (Tolcher et al., 2014; 25344362), a retrospective study for heavily pretreated patients with solid tumors reported tolerable regimens of the combination for 23/31 patients, with 16 patients treated >3 months and evaluable patients achieving a median PFS of 6.5 months (Patterson et al., 2018; AACR Abstract 3891). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Vemurafenib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Vemurafenib is a selective inhibitor of BRAF with V600 mutations and is FDA approved to treat melanoma as monotherapy for patients with the BRAF V600E mutation.

However, the presence of a variant lacking the autoinhibitory region, such as seen in this tumor, has been associated with resistance to vemurafenib in clinical (Rizos et al., 2014; 24463458, Poulikakos et al., 2011; 22113612) and preclinical (Poulikakos et al., 2011; 22113612, Basile et al., 2014; 24422853, Hartsough et al., 2014; 24520098, Basile et al., 2013; 24121492) studies, suggesting this approach may not be beneficial here. Second_generation BRAF inhibitors, including PLX8394 and PLX7904 have been reported to inhibit cell lines with BRAF V600E and BRAF variants lacking the autoinhibitory region (Basile et al., 2014; 24422853, Yao et al., 2019; 30559419). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> Vemurafenib monotherapy in patients with BRAF V600_mutated colorectal cancer (CRC) has shown limited efficacy (Kopetz et al., 2015; 26460303, Hyman et al., 2015; 26287849, Dovrat et al., 2018; 30036146). A study of vemurafenib plus panitumumab reported an ORR of 13% (2/15), median PFS of 3.2 months, and median OS of 7.6 months (Yaeger et al., 2015; 25589621), whereas a study of vemurafenib plus cetuximab reported an ORR of 3.7% (1/27), median PFS of 3.7 months, and median OS of 7.1 months (Hyman et al., 2015; 26287849). In a randomized Phase 2 study of cetuximab and irinotecan with or without vemurafenib for patients with BRAF V600_mutated, RAS_wildtype metastatic CRC, the addition of vemurafenib improved median PFS (4.4 vs. 2.0 months, HR=0.42) and ORR (16% vs. 4.2%, p=0.08) (Kopetz et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 520, Kopetz et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 3505). Dabrafenib and vemurafenib have primarily been studied in the context of BRAF V600E_positive melanoma and NSCLC (Hauschild et al., 2012; 22735384, McArthur et al., 2014; 24508103, Fisher et al., 2012; 22904646, Yang et al., 2010; 20551065, Gentilcore et al., 2013; 23317446, Klein et al., 2013; 23237741, van den Brom et al., 2013; 23473613, Klein et al., 2013; 23490649, Ponti et al., 2013; 23463675, Ponti et al., 2012; 23031422, Parakh et al., 2015; 25382067, Klempner et al., 2016; 27048246). Vemurafenib can induce adverse effects, such as the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas, keratoacanthomas, and new primary melanomas caused by inactivation of wildtype BRAF and leading to paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway (Gibney et al., 2013; 23712190, McArthur et al., 2014; 24508103). In a Phase 1b trial, patients with BRAF V600E_mutated melanoma treated with a combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib had increased RR (87%) and PFS (13.7 months) compared to the RR and PFS values previously reported for vemurafenib or MEK inhibitor monotherapy; this combination also resulted in lower rates of cutaneous SCC (Ribas et al., 2014; 25037139). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Resistant", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Selumetinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Selumetinib is a MEK inhibitor that is FDA approved to treat pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) who have symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PNs).

BRAF mutations have been reported in up to 20% of all cancers, with the majority of mutations occurring at the V600 position (Davies et al., 2002; 12068308, Kandoth et al., 2013; 24132290). Among the V600 mutations, V600E accounts for 70_80% of observations, V600K for 10_30%, and V600R for 5_7%, with V600D comprising the majority of the rest (Davies et al., 2002; 12068308, Greaves et al., 2013; 23273605, Klein et al., 2013; 23237741). Mutations at V600 have been shown to constitutively activate BRAF kinase and hyperactivate the downstream MEK_ERK signaling, promoting oncogenic transformation (Wellbrock et al., 2004; 15059882, Davies et al., 2002; 12068308). In multiple cancer types, multiple mutations at V600, including V600E, V600K, V600R, V600D, and V600M exhibited sensitivity to V600_targeted therapies (Hauschild et al., 2012; 22735384, McArthur et al., 2014; 24508103, Fisher et al., 2012; 22904646, Yang et al., 2010; 20551065, Gentilcore et al., 2013; 23317446, Klein et al., 2013; 23237741, van den Brom et al., 2013; 23473613, Klein et al., 2013; 23490649, Ponti et al., 2013; 23463675, Ponti et al., 2012; 23031422, Parakh et al., 2015; 25382067, Lee et al., 2017; 28194436); other mutations at this position are predicted to behave similarly. Expression of the BRAF kinase domain without the N_terminal auto_inhibitory domain, whether with or without a fusion partner, has been shown to be constitutively active and shown to drive hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway, exhibiting transforming activity (Seivert et al., 2013; 23533272, Pouliakos et al., 2011; 22113612, Botton et al., 2013; 23890088, Ciampi et al., 2005; 15630448, Cin et al., 2011; 21424530, Dahiya et al., 2012; 22548077, Lin et al., 2012; 22157620, Tian et al., 2011; 21884820, Forshew et al., 2009; 19373855, Jones et al., 2008; 18974108, Tran et al., 2005; 15710605, Baitei et al., 2009; 19156774, Gronych et al., 2011; 21403401), in a manner sensitive to MEK inhibitors (Chmielecki et al., 2014; 25266736, Hutchinson et al., 2013; 24345920, Rizos et al., 2014; 24463458, Hartsough et al., 2014; 24520098, Carlino et al., 2014; 24476679, Baitei et al., 2009; 19156774), ERK inhibitors (Carlino et al., 2014; 24476679), pan_RAF inhibitor sorafenib (Botton et al., 2013; 23890088, Gronych et al., 2011; 21403401), and second generation BRAF inhibitors PLX8394 and PLX7904 (Choi et al., 2014; 24283590, Basile et al., 2014; 24422853). Expression of BRAF variants lacking the autoinhibitory region (including variants lacking exons 2_8, 2_10, 4_8, or 4_10) has been reported as an acquired or, rarely, pre_treatment mechanism of resistance to vemurafenib (observed in 9/27 patients who progressed on treatment) and dabrafenib (6/22 cases) in melanoma patients with BRAF V600 mutations (Rizos et al., 2014; 24463458, Poulikakos et al., 2011; 22113612). In cell_based studies, expression of similar BRAF variants also leads to resistance to vemurafenib (Poulikakos et al., 2011; 22113612, Basile et al., 2014; 24422853, Hartsough et al., 2014; 24520098, Basile et al., 2013; 24121492). This tumor harbors a BRAF rearrangement that results in deletion of the N_terminal autoinhibitory region. BRAF fusions have been infrequently reported in colorectal cancer, with an incidence of <1% of cases (Ross et al., 2016; 26314551, Yoshihara et al., 2014; 25500544). BRAF mutations have been reported in approximately 5_19% of colorectal cancer samples (De Roock et al., 2011; 21163703, Di Nicolantonio et al., 2008; 19001320, Dienstmann et al., 2012; 22723336, Safaee et al., 2012; 23056577, Guedes et al., 2013; 23548132). BRAF V600E is a strong adverse prognostic marker in colorectal cancer (NCCN Colon Cancer Guidelines, v2.2021). BRAF mutations have been associated with poor prognosis and shorter survival in patients with colorectal cancer, particularly those with metastatic disease, as well as with smoking history (Sinicrope et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract 3514, Hassabo et al., 2014; ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium Abstract 473) (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Bokemeyer et al., 2012; 22446022, Gavin et al., 2012; 23045248, Laurent_Puig et al., 2009; 19884556, Ogino et al., 2012; 22147942, Roth et al., 2010; 20008640, Douillard et al., 2013; 24024839, Hsu et al., 2016; 26989027). Analysis of individual BRAF mutations in 2127 patients with advanced colorectal cancer treated with chemotherapy with or without cetuximab revealed that BRAF V600E associated with poor prognosis (HR 2.60, P=1.0e_15, with median reduction of survival being 320 days) and distinct clinicopathological features, including correlation with increased peritoneal metastases compared to BRAF wild_type tumors (24% vs. 12%, P=0.0015), while BRAF D594G inactivating mutation was not prognostic (HR 1.30, P=0.37) and had similar clinicopathologic features as BRAF wild_type tumors (Summers et al., 2016; 27815357). Although case studies have reported that patients with parotid gland tumors and melanoma harboring BRAF rearrangements responded to regorafenib (Klempner et al., 2016; 26562024) and sorafenib (Passeron et al., 2011; 22092579) treatment, published data investigating the correlation between BRAF rearrangements and therapeutic benefit of pan_RAF inhibitors are limited; therefore, it is not known whether these agents would be beneficial in this case. BRAF V600 mutations activate MEK_ERK signaling and are associated with sensitivity to BRAF V600 mutation_specific inhibitors such as vemurafenib (McArthur et al., 2014; 24508103), dabrafenib (Hauschild et al., 2012; 22735384, Hauschild et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 10001), and encorafenib (Delord et al., 2017; 28611198); the combination of BRAF V600 mutation_selective inhibitors with MEK inhibitors such as encorafenib plus binimetinib (Dummer et al., 2018; 29573941), vemurafenib plus cobimetinib (Ascierto et al., 2016; 27480103, Ribas et al., 2020; 31732523, Klute et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 122), or dabrafenib plus trametinib (Long et al., 2015; 26037941, Long et al., 2017; 28475671, Robert et al., 2015; 25399551); MEK inhibitors such as trametinib (Flaherty et al., 2012; 22663011, Falchook et al., 2012; 22805292, Kim et al., 2013; 23248257, Hauschild et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 10001), cobimetinib (Larkin et al., 2014; 25265494), binimetinib (Ascierto et al., 2013; 23414587), and selumetinib (Banerjee et al., 2017; 28339824, Fangusaro et al., 2019; 31151904, Robert et al., 2013; 23735514); pan_RAF inhibitors such as sorafenib (Brose et al., 2009; DOI: 10.1200/jco.2009.27.15_suppl.6002, Ahmed et al., 2011; 21566072, Schneider et al., 2016; 26786320, Gautschi et al., 2015; 26200454); and ERK inhibitors (Morris et al., 2013; 23614898). For patients with BRAF V600_mutated CRC, single_agent BRAF inhibitors have shown limited clinical activity (Kopetz et al., 2010; ASCO Abstract 3534, Kopetz et al., 2015; 26460303, Dienstmann et al., 2012; 22723336, Falchook et al., 2012; 22608338, Hyman et al., 2015; 26287849). However, significant clinical benefit has been achieved with combinatorial approaches involving 2 or more of BRAF inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, and EGFR_targeting antibodies (Kopetz et al., 2019; 31566309, Van Cutsem et al., 2019; 30892987, Atreya et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 103, Hong et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 3511, Connolly et al., 2014; 24523613, Capalbo et al., 2014; 24755613, Hyman et al., 2015; 26287849, Yaeger et al., 2015; 25589621, van Geel et al., 2017; 28363909, Corcoran al., 2015; 26392102). However, the concurrent deletion of the BRAF autoinhibitory domain has been correlated with resistance to vemurafenib and dabrafenib in clinical studies (Rizos et al., 2014; 24463458, Poulikakos et al., 2011; 22113612), as well as in preclinical studies of vemurafenib (Poulikakos et al., 2011; 22113612, Basile et al., 2014; 24422853, Hartsough et al., 2014; 24520098, Basile et al., 2013; 24121492). MEK inhibitors (Rizos et al., 2014; 24463458, Hartsough et al., 2014; 24520098, Carlino et al., 2014; 24476679, Baitei et al., 2009; 19156774), ERK inhibitors (Carlino et al., 2014; 24476679), and second generation BRAF inhibitors PLX8394 and PLX7904 (Basile et al., 2014; 24422853) may therefore be more effective in this case. Clinical and preclinical data suggest that BRAF activating mutations or fusions may confer sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, such as trametinib (Flaherty et al., 2012; 22663011, Falchook et al., 2012; 22805292, Kim et al., 2013; 23248257, Bowyer et al., 2014; 24933606, Ross et al., 2015; 26314551, Menzies et al., 2015; 26072686, Lee et al., 2017; 28194436, Grisham et al., 2015; 26324360, Chmielecki et al., 2014; 25266736), selumetinib (Banerjee et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 10065, Banerjee et al., 2017; 28339824, Fangusaro et al., 2019; 31151904, Robert et al., 2013; 23735514), binimetinib (Ascierto et al., 2013; 23414587, Grisham et al., 2018; 29844129), and cobimetinib (Ribas et al., 2014; 25037139, Larkin et al., 2014; 25265494, Ashworth et al., 2014; 24616537); and ERK inhibitors (Morris et al., 2013; 23614898). Although Phase 2 and case studies of sorafenib in BRAF V600_mutated thyroid carcinoma have reported clinical responses (Brose et al., 2009; DOI: 10.1200/jco.2009.27.15_suppl.6002, Ahmed et al., 2011; 21566072, Schneider et al., 2016; 26786320), a patient with a BRAF V600E_mutated NSCLC achieved a PR to sorafenib (Gautschi et al., 2015; 26200454), and a case study has reported that a patient with BRAF_mutated GIST responded to regorafenib treatment (Nannini et al., 2020; 32647535). Another patient with BRAF_mutated GIST did not respond to regorafenib treatment (Ben_Ami et al., 2016; 27371698) and clinical studies in various other diseases have shown conflicting results regarding the correlation between BRAF V600 mutations and efficacy of sorafenib and other pan_RAF inhibitor, such as regorafenib (Tabernero et al., 2013; 23532888, Wilson et al., 2014; 24714776, Ott et al., 2010; 21206909, Amaravadi et al., 2009; 19996224, Flaherty et al., 2008; 18676756, Eisen et al., 2006; 16880785, Alzahrani et al., 2012; 22435913, Innocenti et al, 2020; DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2020.38.4_suppl.196, Lee et al., 2020; 33224274, Garcia_Alfonso et al., 2018; 30120161); therefore, it is not known whether these agents would be beneficial in this case. A BRAF autoinhibitory domain deletion emerged in a patient with BRAF V600E_mutated CRC during progression on cetuximab combined with vemurafenib and irinotecan (Tung et al., 2020; 32669268); therefore, it is unclear whether cetuximab combined with BRAF inhibitors would be beneficial here. Deletions within the BRAF autoinhibitory domain have been identified in 3 patients with V600_mutated melanoma who progressed on combination dabrafenib plus trametinib (Johnson et al., 2018; 29171936, Wagle et al., 2017; 24265154, Chen et al., 2016; 27124486) and in a fourth patient who relapsed on encorafenib plus binimetinib (Rizos et al., 2014; 24463458); therefore, it is unlikely that the combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors would be beneficial here. On the basis of extensive clinical data, BRAF V600 mutation does not generally associate with significant clinical benefit from addition of cetuximab or panitumumab to chemotherapy (NCCN Colon Cancer Guidelines, v2.2021) (Pietrantonio et al., 2015; 25673558, Rowland et al., 2015; 25989278, Van Custem et al., 2011; 21502544, Smith et al., 2013; 23741067, Douillard et al., 2013; 24024839, Karapetis et al., 2014; 24218517, Peeters et al., 2013; 23325582, Peeters et al., 2015; 26341920, Guren et al., 2017; 28399112, Seymour et al., 2013; 23725851). Low response rates to cetuximab or panitumumab monotherapy or combination with chemotherapy have been frequently observed among patients with BRAF V600_mutated CRC, although similarly low response rates in this patient population were also often observed to chemotherapy alone; additionally, response rates were generally lower for patients with BRAF_mutated tumors than for those whose tumors were BRAF_wild_type (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Peeters et al., 2013; 23325582, Seymour et al., 2013; 23725851, Karapetis et al., 2014; 24218517, Di Nicolantonio et al., 2008; 19001320, Stintzing et al., 2017; 28463756, Tol et al., 2009; 19571295). In a limited number of patients with CRC treated with cetuximab_ or panitumumab_containing chemotherapy regimens, BRAF V600E was found to be present at the time of progression (Freeman et al., 2008; 18621636, Gao et al., 2011; 23357879, Soeda et al., 2013; 22638623, Molinari et al., 2011; 21632860, Andre et al., 2013; 23041588, Benvenuti et al., 2007; 17363584), to be a mechanism of acquired (Arena et al., 2015; 25623215, Montagut et al., 2012; 22270724) or primary (Todelo et al., 2017; 27852040) resistance, or to be enriched in nonresponders versus responders (Molinari et al., 2011; 21632860). A Phase 1 trial of the ERK1/2 inhibitor ulixertinib reported PRs for 16% (3/19) of previously treated patients and 1 out of 2 newly diagnosed patients with BRAF V600E_mutant melanoma, 25% (3/12) of patients with BRAF_mutated lung cancer (2 with V600E and 1 with L597Q), and 19% (4/21) of patients with other BRAF_mutated cancers (2 with G469A, 1 with V600E, and 1 with L485W); 2 patients with BRAF V600E mutations also experienced CNS response (Sullivan et al., 2018; 29247021). BRAF inhibitors can induce adverse effects such as the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), keratoacanthomas, and new primary melanomas caused by inactivation of wild_type BRAF and leading to paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway (Gibney et al., 2013; 23712190, McArthur et al., 2014; 24508103, Hauschild et al., 2012; 22735384). Meta_analysis confirmed a reduced risk of developing cutaneous SCC with combined BRAF_ and MEK_inhibition relative to BRAF_inhibitor monotherapy (Peng et al., 2017; 2913734). A Phase 1/2 trial of PLX8394, a next_generation BRAF inhibitor predicted to not induce paradoxical MAPK pathway activation (Zhang et al., 2015; 26466569, Yao et al., 2019; 30559419), reported PRs in patients with BRAF V600E_mutant tumors, specifically in glioma (3/4), papillary thyroid carcinoma (1/9), colorectal cancer (1/10), and ovarian cancer (1/1)(Janku et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 2583).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "BRAF activating alterations may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of BRAF, MEK, or ERK.

Response rates to cetuximab or panitumumab, as monotherapies or in combination with chemotherapy, have generally been found to be low for patients with BRAF V600_mutated CRC; however, improved clinical benefit has been reported from combinations of these EGFR antibodies with BRAF inhibitors, alone or in combination with inhibitors of MEK or PI3K_alpha.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Trametinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Trametinib is a MEK inhibitor that is FDA approved as a monotherapy to treat patients with melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations.

Significant clinical responses to trametinib have been achieved by patients with melanoma harboring BRAF V600E (Falchook et al., 2012; 22805292, Kim et al., 2013; 23248257), V600K (Falchook et al., 2012; 22805292), V600R (Kim et al., 2013; 23248257), K601E (Bowyer et al., 2014; 24933606, Kim et al., 2013; 23248257), L597V (Falchook et al., 2012; 22805292), L597Q (Sullivan et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9537, Bowyer et al., 2014; 24933606), or L597S (Dahlman et al., 2012; 22798288) mutations; by a patient with histiocytosis harboring an activating N486_P490del alteration (Lee et al., 2017; 28194436); as well as by patients with tumors harboring BRAF fusions (Banerjee et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 10065, Ross et al., 2015; 26314551, Menzies et al., 2015; 26072686, Grisham et al., 2015; 26324360, Chmielecki et al., 2014; 25266736, Durham et al., 2019; 31768065). On the basis of emerging clinical evidence, activating alterations or amplification of MAP2K1 may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors such as trametinib. Patients with MAP2K1_mutated histiocytic neoplasms (Gounder et al., 2018; 29768143, Diamond et al., 2015; 26566875, Kumamoto et al., 2019; 30361829), MAP2K1_mutated hairy cell leukemia (Andritsos et al., 2016; ASH Abstract 5598), or MAP2K1_amplified triple_negative breast cancer (Parsons et al., 2016; 27489289) have benefited from treatment with trametinib. </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> Preclinical studies have reported that trametinib shows some activity in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells alone and enhances antitumor effects in cells treated with 5_fluorouracil (Yamaguchi et al., 2011; 21523318, Watanabe et al., 2013; 23438367). In addition, preclinical investigations have shown sensitivity to trametinib in cell lines with activating KRAS mutations in codons 12, 13, and 61 (Gilmartin et al., 2011; 21245089). Phase 1 and Phase 1b studies of trametinib, alone or in combination with gemcitabine, reported some activity in several types of solid tumors (Infante et al., 2013; 23583440, Infante et al., 2012; 22805291). However, Phase 1 monotherapy trials of RO4987655, another MEK inhibitor, have shown no responses and only 1 incidence of stable disease in 31 evaluable patients with CRC, including an expansion cohort of 24 patients with KRAS mutations (Leijen et al., 2012; 22767668, Zimmer et al., 2014; 24947927). In contrast, a trial of combination treatment with selumetinib (another MEK inhibitor) and irinotecan in patients with KRAS_mutated CRC reported confirmed partial responses (PR) in 3/31 (10%) patients, an unconfirmed PR in one patient (3%), and stable disease in 15/31 (48%) patients, improving upon historical clinical trial data of irinotecan single_agent treatment; longer progression_free survival compared to historical controls was also achieved (Hochster et al., 2013; ASCO GI Abstract 380). A Phase 1b trial of combination treatment with the MEK inhibitor MEK162 and the PI3K_alpha inhibitor BYL719 reported stable disease in 43% of patients with KRAS_mutated CRC, with responses independent of PIK3CA mutation status (Juric et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 9051). Another Phase 1b combination trial of trametinib and the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib in solid tumors observed ongoing partial responses in 2/28 (7%) of patients, including one patient with CRC harboring a NRAS Q61K mutation (Sullivan et al., 2015; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract PR06). Although the presence of a KRAS mutation in CRC has been associated with lack of efficacy to monotherapy MEK inhibitors (Infante et al., 2012; 22805291, Zimmer et al., 2014; 24947927, Bennouna et al., 2011; 20127139, Weekes et al., 2013; 23434733), the extent to which other alterations affecting this pathway, such as observed here, confers sensitivity to MEK inhibitors is unclear (Tsimberidou et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract e22086). Whereas frequent adverse events precluded a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for the combination of trametinib and everolimus in a Phase 1b trial for solid tumors (Tolcher et al., 2014; 25344362), a retrospective study for heavily pretreated patients with solid tumors reported tolerable regimens of the combination for 23/31 patients, with 16 patients treated >3 months and evaluable patients achieving a median PFS of 6.5 months (Patterson et al., 2018; AACR Abstract 3891). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Vemurafenib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Vemurafenib is a selective inhibitor of BRAF with V600 mutations and is FDA approved to treat melanoma as monotherapy for patients with the BRAF V600E mutation.

However, the presence of a variant lacking the autoinhibitory region, such as seen in this tumor, has been associated with resistance to vemurafenib in clinical (Rizos et al., 2014; 24463458, Poulikakos et al., 2011; 22113612) and preclinical (Poulikakos et al., 2011; 22113612, Basile et al., 2014; 24422853, Hartsough et al., 2014; 24520098, Basile et al., 2013; 24121492) studies, suggesting this approach may not be beneficial here. Second_generation BRAF inhibitors, including PLX8394 and PLX7904 have been reported to inhibit cell lines with BRAF V600E and BRAF variants lacking the autoinhibitory region (Basile et al., 2014; 24422853, Yao et al., 2019; 30559419). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> Vemurafenib monotherapy in patients with BRAF V600_mutated colorectal cancer (CRC) has shown limited efficacy (Kopetz et al., 2015; 26460303, Hyman et al., 2015; 26287849, Dovrat et al., 2018; 30036146). A study of vemurafenib plus panitumumab reported an ORR of 13% (2/15), median PFS of 3.2 months, and median OS of 7.6 months (Yaeger et al., 2015; 25589621), whereas a study of vemurafenib plus cetuximab reported an ORR of 3.7% (1/27), median PFS of 3.7 months, and median OS of 7.1 months (Hyman et al., 2015; 26287849). In a randomized Phase 2 study of cetuximab and irinotecan with or without vemurafenib for patients with BRAF V600_mutated, RAS_wildtype metastatic CRC, the addition of vemurafenib improved median PFS (4.4 vs. 2.0 months, HR=0.42) and ORR (16% vs. 4.2%, p=0.08) (Kopetz et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 520, Kopetz et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 3505). Dabrafenib and vemurafenib have primarily been studied in the context of BRAF V600E_positive melanoma and NSCLC (Hauschild et al., 2012; 22735384, McArthur et al., 2014; 24508103, Fisher et al., 2012; 22904646, Yang et al., 2010; 20551065, Gentilcore et al., 2013; 23317446, Klein et al., 2013; 23237741, van den Brom et al., 2013; 23473613, Klein et al., 2013; 23490649, Ponti et al., 2013; 23463675, Ponti et al., 2012; 23031422, Parakh et al., 2015; 25382067, Klempner et al., 2016; 27048246). Vemurafenib can induce adverse effects, such as the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas, keratoacanthomas, and new primary melanomas caused by inactivation of wildtype BRAF and leading to paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway (Gibney et al., 2013; 23712190, McArthur et al., 2014; 24508103). In a Phase 1b trial, patients with BRAF V600E_mutated melanoma treated with a combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib had increased RR (87%) and PFS (13.7 months) compared to the RR and PFS values previously reported for vemurafenib or MEK inhibitor monotherapy; this combination also resulted in lower rates of cutaneous SCC (Ribas et al., 2014; 25037139). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Resistant", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Selumetinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Selumetinib is a MEK inhibitor that is FDA approved to treat pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) who have symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PNs).

Mutations in KRAS have been reported in approximately 35_50% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) (Lievre et al., 2006; 16618717, De Roock et al., 2011; 21163703, Chen et al., 2014; 25367198, Li et al., 2015; 25929517, Hu et al., 2016; 27977612, Zekri et al., 2017; 28218784, Staudacher et al., 2017; 29048416, Wang et al., 2018; 29705968, Guo et al., 2018; 29666387). Numerous studies have reported that KRAS mutations are associated with increased metastasis, adverse clinicopathological features, and shorter survival of patients with CRC (Chen et al., 2014; 25367198, Li et al., 2015; 25929517, Hu et al., 2016; 27977612, M\u00e1rmol et al., 2017; 28106826, Zekri et al., 2017; 28218784, Kwak et al., 2017; 28858102). Preclinical and clinical data suggest that KRAS mutations may predict clinical benefit from SHP2 inhibitors (Lu et al., 2019; 31068384, Mainardi et al., 2018; 29808006, Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001, Brana et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3005, Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). A Phase 1 study of RMC_4630 for relapsed/refractory solid tumors reported a DCR of 58% (23/40) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS mutations and a DCR of 75% (12/16) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS G12C mutations (Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001). Interim results from a Phase 1/2 study of RMC_4630 plus cobimetinib reported tumor reduction in 3 of 8 patients with KRAS_mutated colorectal cancer (Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). Activating mutations in KRAS or NRAS are associated with lack of clinical benefit from cetuximab (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Bokemeyer et al., 2011; 21228335, Karapetis et al., 2008; 18946061, De Roock et al., 2008; 17998284) or panitumumab (Douillard et al., 2014; 24718886, Douillard et al., 2012; 24024839, Amado et al., 2008; 18316791) for patients with CRC. Therefore, activating mutations in either gene indicate against the use of cetuximab and panitumumab (NCCN Guidelines v.3.2018). Preclinical evidence suggests that KRAS activation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, such as trametinib, binimetinib, cobimetinib, and selumetinib (Nakano et al., 1984; 6320174, Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Yamaguchi et al., 2011; 21523318, Watanabe et al., 2013; 23438367, Gilmartin et al., 2011; 21245089, Yeh et al., 2009; 19372556). However, multiple clinical trials have reported lack of efficacy of trametinib and other MEK inhibitors when used as monotherapy for treatment of patients with KRAS_mutant CRC (Tsimberidou et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract e22086)(Infante et al., 2012; 22805291, Zimmer et al., 2014; 24947927, Bennouna et al., 2011; 20127139, Weekes et al., 2013; 23434733). Both clinical (Hochster et al., 2013; ASCO GI Abstract 380, Juric et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 9051) and preclinical (Lamba et al., 2014; 25199829, Sun et al, 2014; 24685132) studies suggest that combinatorial approaches including MEK inhibitors are likely to be more effective for the treatment of CRC, including strategies such as combination of MEK inhibitors with PI3K inhibitors (Juric et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 9051), RAF inhibitors (Lamba et al., 2014; 25199829), pan_ERBB inhibitors (Sun et al, 2014; 24685132), or chemotherapeutic agents (Hochster et al., 2013; ASCO GI Abstract 380). Preclinical and limited clinical evidence suggest that KRAS mutation may predict sensitivity to PLK1 inhibitors (Luo et al., 2009; 19490893, Lenz et al., 2020; ASCO GI Abstract TPS265). A Phase 1b/2 study of PLK1 inhibitor onvansertib in combination with FOLFIRI and bevacizumab for patients with KRAS_mutated metastatic CRC previously treated with chemotherapy reported an 87.5% (7/8; 3 PR, 4 SD) clinical benefit rate, with 1 patient going on to successful curative surgery (Barzi et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT235). The reovirus Reolysin targets cells with activated RAS signaling (Strong et al., 1998; 9628872, Coffey et al., 1998; 9812900, Gong and Mita, 2014; 25019061) and is in clinical trials for patients with some tumor types.

Multiple MAP2K1 K57 mutations have been characterized as activating (Arcila et al., 2014; 25351745, Carlino et al., 2015; 25370473, Diamond et al., 2015; 26566875, Grisham et al., 2015; 26324360, Marks et al., 2008; 18632602, Rizos et al., 2014; 24463458, Russo et al., 2015; 26644315) and have been associated with clinical benefit to the MEK inhibitor trametinib in case studies of hairy cell leukemia (Andritsos et al., 2016; ASH Abstract 5598), Erdheim_Chester disease (Diamond et al., 2015; 26566875), and urachal carcinoma (Loh et al., 2016; 27102403) and to selumetinib in preclinical studies (Arcila et al., 2014; 25351745, Bertotti et al., 2015; 26416732, Marks et al., 2008; 18632602). MAP2K1 mutation has been reported in 1_2% of colorectal adenocarcinoma samples (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Bentivegna et al., 2008; 18186519). Preclinical studies have reported that expression of activated forms of MEK1 is sufficient to transform intestinal epithelial cells, and is associated with the formation of adenocarcinoma tumors in mice (Voisin et al., 2008; 19014680). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of MAP2K1 alterations in CRC are limited (PubMed, Aug 2021). Preclinical and clinical data suggest that activating alterations in MAP2K1 may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors (Andritsos et al., 2016; ASH Abstract 5598, Choi et al., 2012; 22327936, Diamond et al., 2015; 26566875, Grisham et al., 2015; 26324360, Marks et al., 2008; 18632602, Gounder et al., 2018; 29768143, Hanrahan et al., 2020; 32641410) such as cobimetinib, trametinib, and selumetinib. On the basis of clinical (Long et al., 2014; 25452114, Rizos et al., 2014; 24463458, Trunzer et al., 2013; 23569304, Van Allen et al., 2014; 24265153, Shi et al., 2014; 24265155) and preclinical (Carlino et al., 2015; 25370473, Greger et al., 2012; 22389471) data, certain MAP2K1 mutations, including Q56P, K57E, and C121S, are associated with resistance to the BRAF inhibitors dabrafenib and vemurafenib. Combinations of both MEK and BRAF inhibitors were able to overcome drug resistance in BRAF_ and MAP2K1_mutated melanoma cell lines in preclinical assays (Shi et al., 2012; 22588879). A patient with BRAF_V600E melanoma and MAP2K1 K57N mutation was reported to have no response to single_agent selumetinib (Catalanotti et al., 2013; 23444215).

Preclinical studies reported that resistance could be overcome in ALK_rearranged lung cancer by combining selumetinib with ceritinib (Crystal et al., 2014; 25394791) and in CRC by MEK/ERK inhibitors (Bertotti et al., 2015; 26416732) or addition of trametinib to cetuximab or panitumumab (Russo et al., 2015; 26644315).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Activating mutation or amplification of MAP2K1 may predict sensitivity to MEK or ERK inhibitors.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Trametinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Trametinib is a MEK inhibitor that is FDA approved as a monotherapy to treat patients with melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations.

Patients with MAP2K1_mutated histiocytic neoplasms (Gounder et al., 2018; 29768143, Diamond et al., 2015; 26566875, Kumamoto et al., 2019; 30361829), MAP2K1_mutated hairy cell leukemia (Andritsos et al., 2016; ASH Abstract 5598), or MAP2K1_amplified triple_negative breast cancer (Parsons et al., 2016; 27489289) have benefited from treatment with trametinib. </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> Preclinical studies have reported that trametinib shows some activity in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells alone and enhances antitumor effects in cells treated with 5_fluorouracil (Yamaguchi et al., 2011; 21523318, Watanabe et al., 2013; 23438367). In addition, preclinical investigations have shown sensitivity to trametinib in cell lines with activating KRAS mutations in codons 12, 13, and 61 (Gilmartin et al., 2011; 21245089). Phase 1 and Phase 1b studies of trametinib, alone or in combination with gemcitabine, reported some activity in several types of solid tumors (Infante et al., 2013; 23583440, Infante et al., 2012; 22805291). However, Phase 1 monotherapy trials of RO4987655, another MEK inhibitor, have shown no responses and only 1 incidence of stable disease in 31 evaluable patients with CRC, including an expansion cohort of 24 patients with KRAS mutations (Leijen et al., 2012; 22767668, Zimmer et al., 2014; 24947927). In contrast, a trial of combination treatment with selumetinib (another MEK inhibitor) and irinotecan in patients with KRAS_mutated CRC reported confirmed partial responses (PR) in 3/31 (10%) patients, an unconfirmed PR in one patient (3%), and stable disease in 15/31 (48%) patients, improving upon historical clinical trial data of irinotecan single_agent treatment; longer progression_free survival compared to historical controls was also achieved (Hochster et al., 2013; ASCO GI Abstract 380). A Phase 1b trial of combination treatment with the MEK inhibitor MEK162 and the PI3K_alpha inhibitor BYL719 reported stable disease in 43% of patients with KRAS_mutated CRC, with responses independent of PIK3CA mutation status (Juric et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 9051). Another Phase 1b combination trial of trametinib and the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib in solid tumors observed ongoing partial responses in 2/28 (7%) of patients, including one patient with CRC harboring a NRAS Q61K mutation (Sullivan et al., 2015; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract PR06). Although the presence of a KRAS mutation in CRC has been associated with lack of efficacy to monotherapy MEK inhibitors (Infante et al., 2012; 22805291, Zimmer et al., 2014; 24947927, Bennouna et al., 2011; 20127139, Weekes et al., 2013; 23434733), the extent to which other alterations affecting this pathway, such as observed here, confers sensitivity to MEK inhibitors is unclear (Tsimberidou et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract e22086). Whereas frequent adverse events precluded a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for the combination of trametinib and everolimus in a Phase 1b trial for solid tumors (Tolcher et al., 2014; 25344362), a retrospective study for heavily pretreated patients with solid tumors reported tolerable regimens of the combination for 23/31 patients, with 16 patients treated >3 months and evaluable patients achieving a median PFS of 6.5 months (Patterson et al., 2018; AACR Abstract 3891). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Selumetinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Selumetinib is a MEK inhibitor that is FDA approved to treat pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) who have symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PNs).

RNF43 mutations are associated with mismatch repair deficiency and microsatellite instability (MSI) in colorectal (Giannakis et al., 2014; 25344691), endometrial (Giannakis et al., 2014; 25344691), and gastric cancers (Wang et al., 2014; 24816253, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317); one study reported RNF43 alterations in more than 50% of MSI gastric carcinomas (Wang et al., 2014; 24816253). Preclinical studies have reported that RNF43 is a negative regulator of WNT signaling, and RNF43 loss or inactivation leads to WNT activation and confers sensitivity to WNT pathway inhibitors, particularly Porcupine inhibitors, in multiple tumor types (Hao et al., 2012; 22575959, Koo et al., 2012; 22895187, Jiang et al., 2013; 23847203, Koo et al., 2015; 26023187, Tsukiyama et al., 2015; 25825523). Therefore, patients whose tumors harbor inactivating alterations in RNF43 may benefit from WNT pathway inhibitors, which are under investigation in clinical trials.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Based on preclinical evidence, tumors with loss or inactivation of RNF43 may be sensitive to inhibitors of the WNT signaling pathway.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT02521844", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT01351103", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03447470", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Blood Tumor Mutational Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "08", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "08"}}, "Interpretation": "Blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations from circulating tumor DNA in blood. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). High bTMB levels were not detected in this sample. It is unclear whether the bTMB levels in this sample would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Depending on the clinical context, TMB testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. In 1 study, the median plasma TMB for 163 patients with metastatic CRC was 16.3 muts/Mb (approximately 8 muts/Mb as measured by this assay) (Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61). In a study for 61 patients with metastatic, microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC treated with best standard of care, plasma TMB scores \u226528 muts/Mb (approximately 14 muts/Mb as measured by this assay) were associated with reduced OS as compared with plasma TMB scores <28 muts/Mb (3.0 vs. 5.3 months, HR 0.76, p=0.007), whereas tissue TMB was not found to be prognostic in this population (Chen et al., 2020; 32379280, Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61). On the basis of clinical evidence in NSCLC and HSNCC, increased bTMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511) and anti_PD_1 (Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074) therapies. In NSCLC, multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 to 16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). In HNSCC, a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Cannot Be Determined", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Cannot Be Determined"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. Approximately 10_15% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) are MSI_high (MSI_H), 8_16% are MSI_low (MSI_L), and the remaining majority are microsatellite_stable (MSS) (Jass et al., 1999; 10562815, Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894). MSI_L tumors occur more frequently in early_stage CRC than advanced CRC (Kambara et al., 2001; 11691787) and resemble MSS tumors in most clinicopathologic features (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947) but harbor a significantly higher frequency of KRAS mutations than MSS tumors (Jass et al., 1999; 10562815, Kambara et al., 2001; 11691787, Konishi et al., 1996; 8690195). Multiple studies have shown that MSI_H CRCs have a better prognosis than MSI_low (MSI_L) or microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors (Samowitz et al., 2001; 11535541, Elsaleh and Iacopetta, 2001; 12445368, Brueckl et al., 2003; 12820457, Guidoboni et al., 2001; 11438476, Gryfe et al., 2000; 10631274, Sinicrope et al., 2006; 16952542, Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Laghi and Malesci, 2012; 22722556). MSI_H CRCs are associated with certain pathologic and molecular features, including poor differentiation, right_sided and mucinous tumors, increased numbers of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, diploidy, and a relatively high frequency of BRAF mutations (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS colorectal cancers are molecularly heterogeneous, driven by diverse mechanisms such as extensive DNA methylation, oncogenic mutations in KRAS or BRAF, or chromosomal instability (Jass, 2007; 17204026). On the basis of prospective clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, MSI and associated increased mutational burden (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to anti_PD_1 and anti_PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92)(Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including the approved therapies nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab) (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436), pembrolizumab (Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92). Pembrolizumab therapy resulted in a significantly higher ORR in MSI_H CRC compared with MSS CRC (40% vs. 0%)(Le et al., 2015; 26028255). Similarly, a clinical study of nivolumab, alone or in combination with ipilimumab, in patients with CRC reported a significantly higher response rate in patients with tumors with high MSI than those without (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635). An earlier case study reported that nivolumab therapy resulted in a complete response in a patient with MSI_H CRC (Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436). A Phase 1b trial of atezolizumab combined with bevacizumab reported PRs for 40% (4/10) of patients with MSI_H CRC (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673). MSI has not been found to be a predictive biomarker for combination chemotherapy regimens, including FOLFOX (Sinicrope et al., 2013; 24019539, Gavin et al., 2012; 23045248) and FOLFIRI (Bertagnolli et al., 2009; 19273709, Van Cutsem et al., 2009; 19451425). Patients with MSS CRC are more likely to benefit from postsurgical fluorouracil (FU)_based adjuvant therapy (Ribic et al., 2003; 12867608, Sargent et al., 2010; 20498393) but less likely to benefit from irinotecan chemotherapy (Fallik et al., 2003; 14522894). As the MSI status of this tumor is unknown, the relevance of these therapeutic approaches is unclear. While approximately 80% of MSI_H tumors arise due to somatic inactivation of an MMR pathway protein, about 20% arise due to germline mutations in one of the MMR genes (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942), which are associated with a condition known as Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC) (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756). Lynch syndrome leads to an increased risk of colorectal, endometrial, gastric, and other cancers (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756, Pande et al., 2012; 22714864, Kastrinos and Syngal, 2007; 17920897) and has an estimated prevalence in the general population ranging from 1:600 to 1:2000 (Silva et al., 2009; 19466295, Sehgal et al., 2014; 24978665, de la Chapelle et al., 2005; 16136383). Therefore, in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "C176R", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "C176R"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 mutations have been reported in up to 60% of colorectal cancer cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Goh et al., 1995; 7585578, Berg et al., 2010; 21103049, Han et al., 2013; 23700467, Peeters et al., 2013; 23325582, Malhotra et al., 2013; 23526092, Di Bartolomeo et al., 2013; 23821376). A study reported p53 expression in 49% of analyzed colorectal cancer cases (Wangefjord et al., 2013; 23337059). TP53 mutation has not been consistently demonstrated to be a significant independent prognostic marker in the context of CRC (Russo et al., 2005; 16172461). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% (17/176) and SDs in 53.4% (94/176) of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21.1% (4/19) in patients with TP53 mutations versus 12.1% (4/33) in patients who were TP53 wild_type (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 31.9% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73.4% (69/94) DCR in patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 42.9% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76.2% (16/21) DCR in patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24.0% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71.4% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel in patients with solid tumors, 75.0% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Additionally, the combination of a CHK1 inhibitor and irinotecan reportedly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival in a TP53_mutated, but not TP53_wild_type, breast cancer xenotransplant mouse model (Ma et al., 2012; 22446188). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may also be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as APR_246 (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571, Lehmann et al., 2012; 22965953, Mohell et al., 2015; 26086967, Franssonet al., 2016; 27179933). In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, APR_246 combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Mar 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Fraction", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "14", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "14"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor fraction provides an estimate of the percentage of ctDNA present in a cell_free DNA (cfDNA) sample. The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with high tumor fraction values have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus higher sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at a lower risk of false negative results (Li et al., 2021; AACR Abstract 2231). However, if tumor fraction is not detected as high, it does not exclude the presence of disease burden or compromise the confidence of reported alterations. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels. In the research setting, changes in tumor fraction estimates have been associated with treatment duration and clinical response and may be a useful indicator for future cancer management (Bronkhorst et al., 2019; 30923679, Raja et al., 2018; 30093454, Hrebien et al., 2019; 30860573, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5039, Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Goodall et al., 2017; 28450425, Goldberg et al., 2018; 29330207).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "BRAF", "Alteration": "V600Edeletion exons 2_10", "Title": "BRAF V600E_mutant Colorectal Cancer Study of Encorafenib Taken With Cetuximab Plus or Minus Chemotherapy (BREAKWATER)", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 3", "Target": "VEGFA, BRAF, EGFR, MEK", "Locations": "Seoul (Korea, Republic of), Nagoya (Japan), Kashiwa (Japan), Herston (Australia), Adelaide (Australia), Melbourne (Australia), Clayton (Australia), Padova (Italy), Utrecht (Netherlands), Barcelona (Spain)", "NCTID": "NCT04607421", "Note": "BRAF activating alterations may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of BRAF, MEK, or ERK.
