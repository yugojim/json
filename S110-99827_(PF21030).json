Alterations such as seen here may disrupt NF2 function or expression (Laulajainen et al., 2012; 22325036, Lallemand et al., 2009; 19910496, Sherman et al., 2007; 9395247, Li et al., 2012; 22482125, Manetti et al., 2012; 23213372, Stokowski et al., 2000; 10712203, Mani et al., 2011; 21402777). NF2 mutation has been observed in 0_3% of urothelial carcinomas (cBio_Robertson et al., 2017; 28988769, cBio_Van Allen et al., 2014; 25096233, cBio_Guo et al., 2013; 24121792, Sfakianos et al., 2015; 26278805). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of NF2 alterations in urothelial carcinoma are limited (PubMed, Jan 2021). NF2 inactivating alterations may indicate sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors (Lopez_Lago et al., 2009; 19451229, James et al., 2009; 19451225, Pachow et al., 2013; 23406776, Iyer et al., 2012; 22923433). Two case studies reported clinical benefit for patients with NF2_mutated cancers, including urothelial carcinoma (Ali et al., 2015; 25630452) and metaplastic breast cancer (Ganesan et al., 2014; 25253784, Moulder et al., 2015; 25878190) treated with everolimus and temsirolimus, respectively. Loss or inactivation of NF2 may also predict sensitivity to FAK inhibitors based on clinical data in mesothelioma (Soria et al., 2016; 27733373) and meningioma (Brastianos et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 2502) and strong preclinical data (Poulikakos et al., 2006; 16652148, Shapiro et al., 2014; 24848258, Shah et al., 2014; 24786638). Limited preclinical and clinical evidence in vestibular schwannoma suggests possible sensitivity of NF2_deficient tumors to the pan_ERBB inhibitor lapatinib (Ammoun et al., 2010; 20511180, Karajannis et al., 2012; 22844108). Similarly, on the basis of limited clinical (Subbiah et al., 2011; ASCO Abstract 2100) and preclinical (Garcia_Rendueles et al., 2015; 26359368, Ammoun et al., 2008; 18593924, Yi et al., 2011; 21481793) evidence, NF2 inactivation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, such as approved agents trametinib and cobimetinib. These and other relevant compounds are being investigated in clinical trials. Whereas frequent adverse events precluded a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for the combination of trametinib and everolimus in a Phase 1b trial for solid tumors (Tolcher et al., 2014; 25344362), a retrospective study for heavily pretreated patients with solid tumors reported tolerable regimens of the combination for 23/31 patients, with 16 patients treated >3 months and evaluable patients achieving a median PFS of 6.5 months (Patterson et al., 2018; AACR Abstract 3891). Heterozygous germline NF2 loss or inactivation is associated with neurofibromatosis type 2, which results in the development of vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas, ependymomas, and ocular disturbances (Evans et al., 2011; 21358190, Lu_Emerson and Plotkin, 2009; 19898272, Asthagiri et al., 2009; 19476995). Prevalence for this disorder in the general population is estimated to be 1:25,000 (Asthagiri et al., 2009; 19476995). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of NF2 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Inactivation or loss of NF2 results in the dysregulation of mTOR and FAK pathway signaling.

A Phase 2 study of everolimus in urothelial carcinoma reported two patients with PRs and eight patients with SD, out of 37 patients treated in the study (Seront et al., 2012; 22473592). Preclinical studies have suggested that the use of everolimus in combination with cisplatin may be an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of urothelial bladder cancer (Pinto_Leite et al., 2012; 23433853). Two case studies of patients with bladder carcinoma harboring inactivating NF2 mutations reported exceptional responses to therapy regimens involving the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (Ali et al., 2015; 25630452, Iyer et al., 2012; 22923433).

This sample harbors a TMB level that may be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors in urothelial carcinoma (Galsky et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 848PD, Necchi et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT003, Rosenberg et al., 2016; 26952546, Balar et al., 2017; 27939400, Powles et al., 2018; 29268948, Mariathasan et al., 2018; 29443960, Miao et al., 2018; 30150660, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Sarid et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 938, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526). In the Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma TCGA dataset, the median somatic mutation burden was 5.5 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014; 24476821). One study reported that the number of somatic mutations positively correlates with increased tumor stage and grade of bladder cancers (Cazier et al., 2016; 24777035). For patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma receiving atezolizumab, however, higher median mutation load has been reported to be significantly associated with improved PFS and OS (Rosenberg et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 104)(Rosenberg et al., 2016; 26952546, Balar et al., 2017; 27939400). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors in urothelial carcinoma, higher TMB has corresponded with clinical benefit from treatment with anti_PD_L1 (Rosenberg et al., 2016; 26952546, Balar et al., 2017; 27939400, Powles et al., 2018; 29268948, Mariathasan et al., 2018; 29443960, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Miao et al., 2018; 30150660) and anti_PD_1 immunotherapeutic agents (Galsky et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 848PD, Necchi et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT003). For patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma treated with the PD_L1 inhibitor atezolizumab, those with a significantly increased mutational load (9.7 Muts/Mb or greater by this assay or others) were associated with response and longer OS compared with those with lower TMB (Rosenberg et al., 2016; 26952546, Powles et al., 2018; 29268948, Balar et al., 2017; 27939400, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254). Similarly, in a study of pembrolizumab in muscle invasive bladder cancer, the median TMB in responders was 12.3 Muts/Mb, versus 7.0 Muts/Mb in nonresponding patients (Necchi et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT003). The PD_1 inhibitor nivolumab led to increased ORR, PFS, and OS for patients with a TMB of 167 missense mutations/tumor or higher (~ equivalency = 9 Muts/Mb or higher as measured by this assay) compared with those harboring lower TMB in a study of metastatic urothelial cancer (Galsky et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 848PD).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Increased tumor mutational burden may predict response to anti_PD_1 (alone or in combination with anti_CTLA_4) or anti_PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Nivolumab + Ipilimumab", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Nivolumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD_1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD_L1 and PD_L2, reducing inhibition of the antitumor immune response, and ipilimumab is a cytotoxic T_lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA_4)_blocking antibody.

Activation of TERT is a hallmark of cancer, being detected in up to 80_90% of malignancies and absent in quiescent cells (Shay et al., 1997; 9282118, Kim et al., 1994; 7605428, Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000; 10647931). Mutations within the promoter region of TERT that confer enhanced TERT promoter activity have been reported in two hotspots, located at _124 bp and _146 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (also termed C228T and C250T, respectively)(Horn et al., 2013; 23348503, Huang et al., 2014; 23348506, Vinagre et al., 2013; 23887589), as well as tandem mutations at positions \u2013124/\u2013125 bp and \u2013138/\u2013139 bp (Horn et al., 2013; 23348503). TERT promoter mutations have been observed in a variety of solid tumors, including bladder cancer (Vinagre et al., 2013; 23887589, Huang et al., 2014; 23348506, Pinyol et al., 2014; 24859456, Rachakonda et al., 2013; 24101484, Liu et al., 2013; 23766237, Landa et al., 2013; 23833040, Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Liu et al., 2013; 23603989, Killela et al., 2013; 23530248). One study reported TERT promoter mutations in 67% (14/21) of high_grade and 56% (34/61) of low_grade bladder carcinomas (Vinagre et al., 2013; 23887589), while another study demonstrated that 85% (44/52) of all bladder cancer samples and 88% (7/8) of bladder cancer cell lines exhibited TERT promoter alteration (Liu et al., 2013; 23603989). TERT promoter mutations correlated with increased TERT mRNA expression in urothelial cancer cells (Borah et al., 2015; 25722414). In patients with bladder urothelial carcinoma, both TERT promoter mutations and increased TERT expression associate with poor prognosis, although carrying an additional germline alteration at _245 (rs2853669) may confer a better prognosis (Kinde et al., 2013; 24121487, Rachakonda et al., 2013; 24101484, Borah et al., 2015; 25722414). Therapeutic options for targeting tumors with TERT mutations are limited, although a variety of approaches are under development, including immunotherapies utilizing TERT as a tumor_associated antigen, antisense oligonucleotide_ or peptide_based therapies, and TERT promoter_directed cytotoxic molecules.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "splice site 994_1G>A", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "splice site 994_1G>A"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 mutation has been reported in 49\u201354% of bladder urothelial carcinoma (UC) (Ross et al., 2013; 23887298, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014; 24476821), 33% of renal pelvis UC (Bringuier et al., 1998; 9761125), and 25% (22/71) of ureter UC samples (Furihata et al., 2000; 10675480). Expression of p53 has been correlated with TP53 mutation, and reported in 52\u201384% of bladder cancers (Esrig et al., 1993; 7901994, Cordon_Cardo et al., 1994; 7906253, Diaz_Cano et al., 2000; 10744064, Kapur et al., 2011; 21571954, Lotan et al., 2013; 23571005, Kim et al., 2014; 25092538), 48% (24/50) bladder SCCs (El_Kenawy et al., 2003; 14756544), 36\u201353% of upper urinary tract UCs (UTUC) (Joung et al., 2008; 18931548, Jinza et al., 1998; 9644783, Kamijima et al., 2005; 16351648), and in 4/4 urethral clear cell carcinomas (Alexiev et al., 2013; 23307189). TP53 mutations in both bladder and renal pelvis urothelial carcinoma (UC) are more common in invasive tumors (Bringuier et al., 1998; 9761125, Goebell and Knowles, 2010; 20610279, Lindgren et al., 2012; 22685613, Kim et al., 2014; 25092538), and have been associated with inferior survival in patients with renal pelvis UC (Bringuier et al., 1998; 9761125) or upper tract UC (UTUC) (Feng et al., 2014; 24500328). Alterations to the p53 pathway are correlated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in bladder cancer (Eissa et al., 2010; 20012564, Mitra et al., 2007; 17710407, Lambrou et al., 2013; 23624844), and p53 overexpression has been linked to poor progression_free survival in UTUC (Lee et al., 2013; 23482786, Feng et al., 2014; 24500328), disease progression in UC of the renal pelvis and ureter (Hashimoto et al., 2000; 11168685), and higher tumor grade in bladder squamous cell carcinoma (Osman et al., 1997; 9815716, Helal et al., 2006; 16998598, Jalali et al., 2011; 22126554). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% (17/176) and SDs in 53.4% (94/176) of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21.1% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12.1% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wild_type (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 31.9% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73.4% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 42.9% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76.2% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24.0% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71.4% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75.0% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Additionally, the combination of a CHK1 inhibitor and irinotecan reportedly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival in a TP53_mutated, but not TP53_wild_type, breast cancer xenotransplant mouse model (Ma et al., 2012; 22446188). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "NF2", "Alteration": "splice site 1575_1G>C", "Title": "Efficacy and Safety of Targeted Precision Therapy in Refractory Tumor With Druggable Molecular Event", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB4, PARP, mTOR, MET, RET, ROS1, VEGFRs, BRAF, CDK4, CDK6", "Locations": "Shanghai (China)", "NCTID": "NCT03239015", "Note": "Inactivation or loss of NF2 results in the dysregulation of mTOR and FAK pathway signaling.
