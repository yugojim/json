CCND2 has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210), and may be biologically relevant in this context (Zack et al., 2013; 24071852, Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). In the TCGA dataset, CCND2 amplification was observed in 1.5% of breast invasive carcinoma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 23000897). Additionally, several studies in breast cancer have demonstrated promoter hypermethylation and subsequent repression of CCND2 expression, and this effect is potentiated in BRCA_negative tumors (Li et al., 2006; 16029926, Sharma et al., 2007; 17383681, Suijkerbuijk et al., 2008; 18647968). CCND2 has been reported to be one of the most frequently methylated genes in premalignant and malignant breast lesions, and this study suggests that methylation of a group of genes, including CCND2, may play an important role in the development of breast cancer driven by precursor columnar cell lesions (Verschuur_Maes et al., 2012; 23104224). Low CCND2 expression is associated with unfavorable OS in breast cancer (HR = 0.173) (Hung et al., 2018; 30308939). Although preclinical studies suggest that cyclin D2 activates CDK4/6 (Busk et al., 2005; 15707582, Busk, 2003; 12695654), it is unknown whether CCND2 amplification or activating mutation predicts response to CDK4/6 inhibitors such as abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib. Clinical studies of CDK4/6 inhibitors have shown the most promise for estrogen receptor_positive breast cancer (Finn et al., 2014; 25524798, DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "CCND2 amplification or activation may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04282031", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05252416", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05159245", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04603183", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03994796", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03573648", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02896335", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04352777", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04360941", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "ERBB2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "true", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "ERBB2 (also known as HER2) encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase which is in the same family as EGFR. Amplification or overexpression of ERBB2 can lead to excessive proliferation and tumor formation (Higgins and Baselga, 2011; 21965336). In the TCGA dataset, ERBB2 amplification was detected in 13% of breast invasive carcinoma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 23000897). ERBB2 mutations have been reported in 1_3% of breast invasive carcinoma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 23000897, cBio_Banerji et al., 2012; 22722202, Ross et al., 2016; 27284958). The incidence of ERBB2 alterations has been found to be significantly enriched in CDH1_mutated invasive lobular breast cancers (Ross et al., 2013; 23575477). HER2 is predicted to be overexpressed (as assessed by FISH, CNV analysis, or immunohistochemistry) in 12_25% of breast cancers (Chmielecki et al., 2014; 25480824, Stern, 2012; 22461643, Jones and Buzdar, 2009; 19959074). Phosphorylated HER2 was expressed in 62.5% (55/88) of HER2_positive breast cancers (Ramic et al., 2013; 23749902). HER2 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in invasive breast cancer (NCCN Breast Cancer Guidelines, v4.2022). For patients with breast cancer and positive axillary lymph nodes, amplification of HER2 was correlated with shorter time to relapse and overall survival as compared with patients with non_amplified tumors by univariate and multivariate analysis, with greater differences observed in patients whose tumors harbored >5 copies of HER2 (Slamon et al., 1987; 3798106). Retrospective analysis has reported that patients with low_grade, node_negative, HER2_positive breast cancer have a 5_year survival rate of 68% compared with 96% for patients with HER2_negative tumors (Tovey et al., 2009; 19223897). Alterations in ZNF703, ERBB2, MDM2, PALB2, ARFRP1, IRS2, and JAK2 may be associated with resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors and impaired PFS for patients with HR+ metastatic breast cancer, according to a retrospective study of 131 patients (Lee et al., 2021; SABCS Abstract P5_13_35). Acquisition of resistance to trastuzumab was correlated with negativity for pHER2 (p=0.028) for patients with HER2_positive breast cancer (Ramic et al., 2013; 23749902). On the basis of extensive clinical evidence, ERBB2 amplification or activating mutation may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting HER2, including antibodies such as trastuzumab (Slamon et al., 2001; 11248153, Bang et al., 2010; 20728210, Chumsri et al., 2015; 26358791, Cappuzzo et al., 2006; 16775247, Falchook et al., 2013; 23328556, Mazieres et al., 2013; 23610105), pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab (Baselga et al., 2012; 22149875, Swain et al., 2015; 25693012, Chumsri et al., 2015; 26358791, Meric_Bernstam et al., 2019; 30857956), and zanidatamab (ZW25) (Meric_Bernstam et al., 2022; 36400106), as well as antibody_directed conjugates such as ado_trastuzumab emtansine (T_DM1) (Verma et al., 2012; 23020162) and fam_trastuzumab deruxtecan (T_DXd) (Modi et al., 2020; 31825192, Shitara et al., 2020; 32469182, Li et al., 2022; 34534430, Smit et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 1361TiP), HER2 kinase inhibitors such as tucatinib (Murthy et al., 2020; 31825569, Borges et al., 2018; 29955792, Murthy et al., 2018; 29804905, Moulder et al., 2017; 28053022), and dual EGFR/HER2 kinase inhibitors such as lapatinib (Fan et al., 2020; 32478891, Cameron et al., 2010; 20736298, Geyer et al., 2006; 17192538, Serra et al., 2013; 23950206, Ali et al., 2014; 24516025, Grellety et al., 2015; 26487584, Vornicova et al., 2014; 25085898, Ronellenfitsch et al., 2020; 32017710, Hou et al., 2020; 32405522), afatinib (Lin et al., 2012; 22418700, Schwab et al., 2014; 25268372, De Greve et al., 2015; 25682316, De Greve et al., 2012; 22325357, Li et al., 2015; 26559459, Mazieres et al., 2013; 23610105, Bedard et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT139, Dziadziuszko et al., 2019; 30825613, Lai et al., 2019; 30685684, Liu et al., 2018; 30425522, Fang et al., 2019; 31748336, Yuan et al., 2020; 32477948), neratinib (Ben_Baruch et al., 2015; 26358790, Ma et al., 2017; 28679771, Hyman et al., 2018; 29420467, Smyth et al., 2020; 31806627, Li et al., 2020; WCLC Abstract FP14.15), dacomitinib (Kris et al., 2015; 25899785), and pyrotinib (Jiang et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 1001, Xu et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 1003). For patients with HER2_positive metastatic breast cancer (mBC), combining tucatinib (Murthy et al., 2020; 31825569), margetuximab (Rugo et al., 2021; 33480963), or pyrotinib (Jiang et al., 2019; ASCO 2020; doi: 10.21037/tbcr_20_25, Xu et al., 2021; 33581774) with chemotherapy or other HER2_targeted agents significantly improved PFS and/or ORR. For patients who progressed on trastuzumab, the combination of pyrotinib with capecitabine elicited improved median PFS (mPFS) compared with lapatinib plus capecitabine (12.5 vs. 6.8 months, HR=0.39) in the Phase 3 PHOEBE study (Xu et al., 2021; 33581774) and compared with placebo plus capecitabine (11.1 vs. 4.1 months, HR=0.18) in the Phase 3 PHENIX study (Jiang et al., 2020; doi: 10.21037/tbcr_20_25); patients with trastuzumab_resistant disease in these studies experienced mPFS of 12.4 months (Jiang et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 1048). The Phase 2 PERMEATE study evaluated pyrotinib plus capecitabine for treating patients with HER2_positive mBC and brain metastases, reporting a CNS ORR of 75% (44/59) for radiotherapy_naive patients and 42% (8/19) for patients with prior radiotherapy (Yan et al., 2022; 35085506). For patients with HER2_positive mBC who progressed on HER2_targeted therapy, Phase 2 studies of poziotinib have reported ORRs of 22% (6/27) to 26% (n=102) and PFS rates of 3.0_4.9 months, and 1 study has reported a median OS of 17.7 months (Brufsky et al., 2020; SABCS Abstract PD1_07, Park et al., 2022; ESMO Breast Abstract 176P). For patients with HER2_positive mBC who progressed on previous regimens, including ado_trastuzumab emtansine, treatment with vic_trastuzumab duocarmazine significantly improved mPFS compared with the physician\u2019s choice of chemotherapy (7.0 vs. 4.9 months, HR=0.64) in the Phase 3 TULIP trial (Manich et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA15). A Phase 1 study evaluating the bispecific HER2 antibody KN026 for patients with previously treated HER2_positive mBC reported an ORR of 28% (16/57) and mPFS of 6.8 months with the recommended Phase 2 dose (Zhang et al., 2022; 34844975). For patients with HER2_positive metastatic breast cancer, the combination of lapatinib with letrozole (Johnston et al., 2009; 19786658) or other aromatase inhibitors (Johnston et al., 2020; 32822287) significantly improved PFS and/or ORR. In the context of HER2_positive breast cancer, retrospective (Takada et al., 2013; 23679233, Jensen et al., 2011; 22172323, Berns et al., 2007; 17936563, Loibl et al., 2014; 25199759, Razis et al., 2011; 21594665, Esteva et al., 2010; 20813970) and Phase 2 or 3 (Dave et al., 2011; 21135276, Baselga et al., 2014; 25332247) clinical studies suggest that concurrent PTEN inactivation or PIK3CA alterations leading to PI3K pathway activation promote resistance to therapies targeting HER2 (Zhang et al., 2011; 21399647, Kataoka et al., 2010; 19633047); however, one retrospective study did not support this association (Barbareschi et al., 2012; 22744290). Combined inhibition of HER2 and the PI3K pathway may be required in HER2_positive tumors with PIK3CA mutation (Esteva et al., 2010; 20813970, Baselga et al., 2014; 25332247, Chakrabarty et al., 2010; 20581867, Cizkova et al., 2010; San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium Abstract P2_09_30, Kataoka et al., 2010; 19633047, Wang et al., 2011; 21676217).

Single_agent neratinib showed modest CNS activity (7.5% ORR, 3/40) in a Phase 2 study for patients with breast cancer and HER2+ brain metastases (Freedman et al., 2016; 26834058).

In a retrospective study for patients with HER2_positive breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab, patients with non_inflammatory breast cancer reported a significant association between elevated HER2 FISH ratio and increased pathologic CR rate and longer OS, compared with patients with inflammatory breast cancer (IBC)(Kogawa et al., 2020; 32003919). In a study of patients with early breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant trastuzumab, higher ERBB2 copy number (HER2/CEP17 ratio >6) correlated with increased incidence of pathologic CR compared to lower ERBB2 copy number (Singer et al., 2017; 28143867). A Phase 3 study of adjuvant trastuzumab with chemotherapy for patients with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer (BC) demonstrated significant improvements in OS, time to progression, and ORR (Slamon et al., 2001; 11248153). Two Phase 3 studies comparing 6_month with 12_month adjuvant trastuzumab reported similar disease_free survival (DFS) rates for patients with HER2+ early_stage BC after 6.1 or 7.5 years of median follow_up (Earl et al., 2020; 32880572, Pivot et al., 2019; 31178155).

Amplification of FGFR1 has been correlated with protein expression (Kohler et al., 2012; 22648708, Kim et al., 2013; 23182986) and may predict pathway activation and sensitivity to therapies targeting this pathway (Andr\u00e9 et al., 2014; 24508104, Dienstmann et al., 2014; 24265351). FGFR1 amplification has been reported in 10 to 27% of breast cancers (Letessier et al., 2006; 17040570, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 23000897, Elbauomy et al., 2007; 17397528, Gelsi_Boyer et al., 2005; 16380503, Andre et al., 2009; 19147748, Turner et al., 2010; 20179196, Moelans et al., 2010; 20473280) and correlated with FGFR1 mRNA overexpression (Gelsi_Boyer et al., 2005; 16380503, Andre et al., 2009; 19147748, Turner et al., 2010; 20179196, Reis_Filho et al., 2006; 17121884, Giltane et al., 2017; 28794284). FGFR1 amplification correlates with poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer (Hanker et al., 2017; 28381415, Elbauomy et al., 2007; 17397528, Jang et al., 2012; 22863309, Gelsi_Boyer et al., 2005; 16380503), including those with HER2_positive cancer treated with adjuvant trastuzumab (Hanker et al., 2017; 28381415), and patients with hormone_receptor positive cancer (Jang et al., 2012; 22863309, Elbauomy et al., 2007; 17397528). For patients with HR_positive/HER2_negative breast tumors treated with first_line endocrine therapy, FGFR1 amplification associated with a shorter time to progression compared to non_amplified tumors (8.0 vs 13.3 months)(Drago et al., 2019; 31371343). Alterations that activate FGFR1 may predict sensitivity to selective FGFR inhibitors including erdafitinib (Loriot et al., 2019; 31340094, Tabernero et al., 2015; 26324363, Karkera et al., 2017; 28416604, Park et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 4117), pemigatinib (Necchi et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 900P), infigratinib (Pal et al., 2018; 29848605, Pal et al., 2020; 32208524), futibatinib (Bahleda et al., 2020; 32622884, Meric_Bernstam et al., 2022; 34551969, Kasbekar et al., 2020; 32649766), rogaratinib (Schuler et al., 2019; 31405822), Debio 1347 (Sait et al., 2021; 34250399, Voss et al., 2019; 30745300), and derazantinib (Papadopoulos et al., 2017; 28972963), or multikinase inhibitors such as pazopanib (Cheng et al., 2017; 29223982, Yuan et al., 2016; SABCS Abstract P6_16_08) and ponatinib (Khodaoust et al., 2015; 26055304, Tanasi et al., 2019; 31434701, Strati et al., 2018; 29119847, Kreil et al., 2015; Abstract 2812). The activity and efficacy of selective FGFR inhibitors for FGFR1_amplified tumors has been modest with limited responses reported in FGFR1_amplified lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) treated with infigratinib (Nogova et al., 2017; 27870574) or AZD457 (Aggarwal et al., 2019; 31195180) and no responses reported among patients with FGFR1_amplified breast cancer treated with infigratinib (Nogova et al., 2017; 27870574). Two case studies reported PRs in patients with FGFR1_amplified breast cancer treated with pazopanib (Cheng et al., 2017; 29223982, Yuan et al., 2016; SABCS Abstract P6_16_08). Exploratory biomarker analysis in the Phase 2 FINESSE study of lucitanib for the treatment of patients with HR+/HER2_ metastatic breast cancer reported higher ORR in patients with FGFR1 high_amplified (copy number at least 4) tumors than in those with FGFR1 low_ or non_amplified tumors (22% vs. 9%) (Hui et al., 2019; 31619444). A Phase 1/2a study of lucitanib for the treatment of patients with breast carcinoma harboring amplifications of FGFR1, FGF3, FGF4, or FGF19 reported a DCR of 100% (12/12), including 6 PRs with several in FGFR1_amplified tumors (Soria et al., 2014; 25193991). In an arm of the Phase 2 TAPUR study in which 27 patients with FGFR1_altered (predominantly amplification) metastatic breast cancer treated with the multi_kinase inhibitor sunitinib were evaluable for efficacy, 2 PRs and 5 SDs lasting 16 weeks or longer were reported (Calfa et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT173). Case series have reported FGFR1 amplification for 10 patients with ER+/HER2\u2212 breast cancer who progressed on letrozole (Formisano et al., 2017; 28751448, Giltane et al., 2017; 28794284, Mao et al., 2020; 32723837), including 1 patient with acquired resistance (Mao et al., 2020; 32723837). Amplification occurred at significantly higher incidence for resistant patients than for those sensitive to letrozole or with intermediate response (42.9% [9/21] vs. 7.5% [3/40] vs. 9.1% [1/11], p=0.0011) in 1 study (Formisano et al., 2017; 28751448). Retrospective studies have reported significantly shorter time to progression (n=56, p=0.05)(Drago et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 1013) and OS (n=94, p=0.004)(Elbauomy et al., 2007; 17397528) for patients with FGFR1_amplified versus non_amplified HR+ metastatic breast cancers treated with endocrine therapy. Limited clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that FGFR1 amplification may be associated with reduced sensitivity to alpelisib in breast cancer (Mayer et al., 2017; 27126994). However, for patients with HR+, HER2\u2212 breast cancer with PIK3CA alterations, retrospective analysis reported increased clinical benefit following treatment with alpelisib plus fulvestrant for those with FGFR1 alterations versus wildtype FGFR1, with median PFS of 12.7 vs. 11.0 months and HR against placebo of 0.36 versus 0.54 (Juric et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 1006).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "FGFR inhibitors may be relevant in tumors with alterations that activate FGFR1.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Pazopanib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Pazopanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets VEGFRs, PDGFRs, FGFRs, KIT, ITK, LCK, and c_FMS.

Phase 2 clinical trials of pazopanib with lapatinib in patients with HER2_positive breast cancer reported that the combination was associated with higher response rate than lapatinib alone but did not bring about an increase in PFS (Johnston et al., 2013; 23283526, Cristofanilli et al., 2013; 23239151). A multicenter single_arm Phase 2 study evaluating pazopanib combined with paclitaxel as neoadjuvant following doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide reported CRs in 9% (6/67) and 38% (10/26) of patients with HR+ and triple_negative locally advanced breast cancer cases, respectively; however, a high level of toxicity led to discontinuation of pazopanib in 61% of patients (Tan et al., 2015; 25542269). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT05098847", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05024214", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04169672", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04803318", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05077384", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04008797", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04962867", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04977453", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03564691", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04565275", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "MTAP", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "loss", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "loss"}}, "Interpretation": "MTAP encodes S_methyl_5 _thioadenosine (MTA) phosphorylase, a tumor suppressor involved in polyamine metabolism and methionine synthesis, although its enzymatic function is dispensable for its tumor suppressor activity (Limm et al., 2016; 27479139, Tang et al., 2014; 25387827). Decreased expression of MTAP leads to MTA accumulation within tumor cells and their microenvironment (Kirovski et al., 2011; 21356366, Limm et al., 2013; 23265702, Stevens et al., 2009; 19097084), thereby reducing intracellular arginine methylation (Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473, Mavrakis et al., 2016; 26912361, Kryukov et al., 2016; 26912360) and altering cell signaling (Limm et al., 2014; 25087184, Stevens et al., 2009; 19097084). MTAP is located at 9p21, adjacent to CDKN2A and CDKN2B, with which it is frequently co_deleted in various cancers. Other alterations in MTAP are rare and have not been extensively characterized. MTAP loss/homozygous deletion as well as loss of expression has been reported in a wide variety of solid tumors and hematologic cancers (Wei et al., 2016; 27929028, Zhao and Zhao, 2016; 27556634); such events have been correlated with poor prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (Kirovski et al., 2011; 21356366), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (Huang et al., 2009; 19887491), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)(Marce et al., 2006; 16778103), melanoma (Meyer et al., 2010; 20500769, Wild et al., 2006; 16618867), gastric cancer (Kim et al., 2011; 21412930), myxofibrosarcoma (Li et al., 2014; 25426549), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (He et al., 2015; 26656376), ovarian carcinoma (Wei et al., 2016; 27929028) and non_small cell lung cancer (Su et al., 2014; 24969958). MTAP loss was not prognostic in pediatric B_cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (Mirebeau et al., 2006; 16818274) or in astrocytoma (Becker et al., 2015; 26088413). However, MTAP has also been reported to be overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (Snezhkina et al., 2016; 27433286), and MTAP retention is thought to be important for prostate cancer growth due to continuous supply of SAM (Bistulfi et al., 2016; 26910893). Germline SNPs in MTAP have been correlated with the development of cutaneous melanoma (Antonopoulou et al., 2015; 25407435, Mccioni et al., 2013; 23816148), esophageal cancer (Hyland et al., 2016; 26635288, Lin et al., 2017; 27960044), osteosarcoma (Zhi et al., 2016; 27994653), and CRC (Gu et al., 2013; 23361049). MTAP inactivation produces specific metabolic vulnerabilities that may be sensitive to MAT2A (Kalev et al., 2021; 33450196, Heist et al., 2019; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract B116, Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473) or PRMT5 inhibition (Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473, Mavrakis et al., 2016; 26912361, Kryukov et al., 2016; 26912360). A Phase 1 trial of MAT2A inhibitor AG_270 reported 1 PR and 2 SDs lasting longer than 6 months for patients with advanced solid tumors displaying MTAP loss (Heist et al., 2019; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract B116). Preclinical data suggest that MTAP loss sensitizes cells to S_adenosyl_L_methionine (SAM)_competitive PRMT5 inhibitors (Guccione and Richard, 2019; 31350521), dual PRMT1 and PRMT5 inhibitors (Fedoriw et al., 2019; 31257072, Srour et al., 2019; 31287990, Gao et al., 2019; 30916320), and PRMT5 inhibitors that selectively bind the PRMT5 when complexed with S_methyl_5 _thioadenosine (MTA), such as MRTX1719, TNG908, and AMG193 (Smith et al., 2022; 35041419, Briggs et al., 2022; AACR Abstract 3941). In preclinical models, MTAP inactivation showed increased sensitivity to inhibitors of purine synthesis or purine analogs, especially upon addition of exogenous MTA (Hansen et al., 2019; 31040154, Tang et al., 2018; 29844120, Munshi et al., 2014; 24928612, de Oliveira et al., 2016; 26751376, Lubin and Lubin, 2009; 19478948, Tang et al., 2012; 22825330, Collins et al., 2012; 22252602, Bertino et al., 2011; 21301207, Coulthard et al., 2011; 21282358, Miyazaki et al., 2007; 17912432, Efferth et al., 2002; 11987241). A Phase 2 study of L_alanosine, an inhibitor of adenine synthesis, as a monotherapy for 65 patients with MTAP_deficient cancers reported no responses and SD for 24% (13/55) of patients (Kindler et al., 2009; 18618081).

PIK3CA alterations that have been characterized as activating, such as observed here, are predicted to be oncogenic (Kang et al., 2005; 15647370, Ikenoue et al., 2005; 15930273, Gymnopoulos et al., 2007; 17376864, Horn et al., 2008; 18317450, Rudd et al., 2011; 21266528, Hon et al., 2012; 22120714, Burke et al., 2012; 22949682, Wu et al., 2009; 19915146, Dbouk et al., 2010; 2103068, Dan et al., 2010; 20530683, Oda et al., 2008; 18829572, Zhao and Vogt, 2008; 18794883, Lui et al., 2013; 23619167, Ross et al., 2013; 22430209, Riviere et al., 2012; 22729224, Shibata et al., 2009; 19394761, Droguluk et al., 2015; 26627007, Croessmann et al., 2018; 29284706, Ng et al., 2018; 29533785, Spangle et al., 2020; 32929011, Chen et al., 2018; 29636477, Jin et al., 2021; 34779417). Mutations in PIK3CA have been reported in up to 37% of breast cancer cases (Razavi et al., 2018; 30205045, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 23000897). In the randomized Phase 2 SAFIR02 trial, PIK3CA mutations were associated with reduced OS in patients with hormone_receptor_positive (HR+)/HER2 negative (HER_) metastatic breast cancer but with improved OS in patients with mTNBC compared to patients with PIK3CA wildtype status (Mosele et al., 2020; 32067679). Although double PIK3CA mutations were frequently observed in HR+/HER2_ breast cancers, as compared with other receptor subtypes (15% vs. 5.4%, p=0.004), this did not impact invasive disease_free survival or OS for patients when compared with single PIK3CA mutations by univariate and multivariate analysis in 1 retrospective study (Vasan et al., 2019; 31699932). For patients with HER2+ breast cancer receiving trastuzumab and pertuzumab with chemotherapy, PIK3CA mutations significantly associated with shorter PFS (13 vs. 23 months; HR=1.98)(Ferraro et al., 2021; SABCS Abstract GS3_03). Mutations in coding exon 20 (H1047R) of PIK3CA have been associated with a better prognosis in breast carcinoma than mutations occurring in coding exon 9 (E542K) (Barbareschi et al., 2007; 17947469). Clinical and preclinical data in various tumor types indicate that PIK3CA activating alterations may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting PI3K (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574, Juric et al., 2018; 29401002, Gallant et al., 2019; 30793038, Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23, Delestre et al., 2021; 34613809, Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Santin et al., 2020; 31934607, Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871), AKT (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Smyth et al., 2021; 33863913), or mTOR (Varnier et al., 2019; 31351267, Basse et al., 2018; 32914004, Sultova et al., 2021; 33277683, Mackay et al., 2014; 24166148, Myers et al., 2016; 27016228, Dhami et al., 2018; 29588307, Harris et al., 2019; 30863722, Hanna et al., 2018; 29301825). In the Phase 3 SOLAR_1 study, the addition of alpelisib to fulvestrant statistically improved PFS (11.0 vs. 5.7 months, HR=0.65) and ORR (27% vs. 13%) and numerically improved median OS (mOS; 39.3 vs. 31.4 months, HR=0.86) in PIK3CA_mutated hormone_receptor_positive (HR+), HER2_ breast cancer compared with placebo with fulvestrant, but not in PIK3CA_wildtype HR+, HER2_ breast cancer (Andre et al., 2021; 33246021). In a Phase 2 trial, the addition of the AKT inhibitor capivasertib to fulvestrant improved median PFS (mPFS) for patients with PIK3CA_, AKT1_, and/or PTEN_altered HR+, HER2_ metastatic breast cancer (12.8 vs. 4.6 months, HR=0.44) (Jones et al., 2020; 32035020, Howell et al., 2022; 35671774). A Phase 2 study of alpelisib monotherapy for patients harboring PIK3CA_mutated HR+, HER2_ breast cancer reported an ORR of 38% (10/26), mPFS of 5.4 months, median OS of 18.8 months, and median duration of response of 5.6 months; no responses (0% ORR [0/7]) were reported for PIK3CA_mutated triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients (Savas et al., 2022; 35771551). Single_agent capivasertib also demonstrated activity in a Phase 1 study (Banerji et al., 2018; 29066505). In trials of AKT inhibitors with paclitaxel, neither capivasertib nor ipatasertib showed significant mPFS benefit for patients with PI3K pathway_mutated HR+, HER2_ metastatic breast cancer compared with paclitaxel plus placebo (Turner et al., 2019; 30860570, Turner et al., 2020; Abstract 283MO). In a Phase 1 study, the PIK3CA_selective inhibitor inavolisib (GDC_0077) alone or in combination with endocrine therapy (letrozole or fulvestrant) with or without palbociclib yielded an ORR of 32% (23/73) for patients with PIK3CA_mutated HR+, HER2_ breast cancer, with an ORR of 40% (6/15) observed for patients who received inavolisib plus palbociclib and fulvestrant (Jhaveri et al., 2020; Abstract PS5_12, Bedard et al., 2020; SABCS Abstract PD1_02). A Phase 1 study of combination palbociclib, fulvestrant, and the pan_PIK3CA inhibitor taselisib reported an ORR of 38% (9/24), DCR of 58% (14/24), and mPFS of 7.2 months for patients with PIK3CA_mutated ER+, HER2_ breast cancer (Pascual et al., 2021; 32958578). The addition of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus to exemestane to treat HR+, HER2_ advanced breast cancer has shown clinical benefit, regardless of PIK3CA status (Moynahan et al., 2017; 28183140, Hortobagyi et al., 2016; 26503204). A Phase 2 trial of capivasertib with paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone showed a median OS benefit (19.1 vs. 13.5 months) both for patients with AKT1, PTEN, or PIK3CA_mutated triple_negative breast cancer (TNBC; HR=0.58, 95% CI 0.2_1.6) and for patients with TNBC without PI3K_pathway mutations (HR=0.74, 95% CI 0.47_1.18) (Schmid et al., 2020; SABC Abstract PD1_11). Despite promising initial results in earlier trials, the Phase 3 IPATunity130 trial for patients with AKT1, PTEN, or PIK3CA_mutated TNBC failed to show improved PFS for first_line ipatasertib in combination with paclitaxel relative to paclitaxel alone (7.4 vs. 6.1 months) (Dent et al., 2020; SABCS Abstract GS3_04, Kim et al., 2017; 28800861, Dent et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 1390, Dent et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 1008). The Phase 2 NCI_MATCH study of copanlisib for patients with refractory solid tumors harboring PIK3CA mutations with or without PTEN loss met its primary endpoint with an ORR of 16% (4/25 PRs); responses (PR or SD >6 months) were seen in patients with ameloblastoma, liposarcoma, and carcinomas of the endometrium, ovary, esophagus, lung, and prostate (Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871). However, the Phase 2 study of copanlisib for patients with endometrial carcinoma harboring PIK3CA hotspot mutations failed to report any objective responses (n=11)(Santin et al., 2020; 31934607). Two other studies of copanlisib for patients with genomically unselected tumors reported 1 CR and 2 PRs (1 unconfirmed) among 16 total patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors with or without PTEN alterations (Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108). In the context of HER2_positive breast cancer, retrospective (Takada et al., 2013; 23679233, Jensen et al., 2011; 22172323, Berns et al., 2007; 17936563, Loibl et al., 2014; 25199759, Razis et al., 2011; 21594665, Esteva et al., 2010; 20813970) and Phase 2 or 3 (Dave et al., 2011; 21135276, Baselga et al., 2014; 25332247) clinical studies suggest that concurrent PTEN inactivation or PIK3CA alterations leading to PI3K pathway activation promote resistance to therapies targeting HER2 (Zhang et al., 2011; 21399647, Kataoka et al., 2010; 19633047); however, one retrospective study did not support this association (Barbareschi et al., 2012; 22744290). Combined inhibition of HER2 and the PI3K pathway may be required in HER2_positive tumors with PIK3CA mutation (Esteva et al., 2010; 20813970, Baselga et al., 2014; 25332247, Chakrabarty et al., 2010; 20581867, Cizkova et al., 2010; San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium Abstract P2_09_30, Kataoka et al., 2010; 19633047, Wang et al., 2011; 21676217). Limited clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that FGFR1 amplification may be associated with reduced sensitivity to alpelisib in breast cancer (Mayer et al., 2017; 27126994). However, for patients with HR+, HER2\u2212 breast cancer with PIK3CA alterations, retrospective analysis reported increased clinical benefit following treatment with alpelisib plus fulvestrant for those with FGFR1 alterations versus wildtype FGFR1, with median PFS of 12.7 vs. 11.0 months and HR against placebo of 0.36 versus 0.54 (Juric et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 1006).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PIK3CA activating mutations may lead to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may therefore indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.

In ER+/HER2\u2013 breast cancer, PFS benefit from the addition of alpelisib to fulvestrant was specifically observed for patients with PIK3CA mutations (11.0 vs. 5.7 months, HR=0.65), including patients with PIK3CA exon 9 or exon 20 mutations (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> Biomarker analysis of the SOLAR_1 trial showed that the addition of alpelisib to fulvestrant improved median PFS relative to placebo for patients with PIK3CA_mutated, HR+, HER2_ breast cancer and either co_occurring FGFR1 (12.7 vs. 3.8 months, HR=0.36) or FGFR2 (9.6 vs. 2.8 months, HR=0.28) alteration (Juric et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 1006). In the Phase 3 SOLAR_1 study for patients with HR+, HER2_ endocrine_therapy_resistant advanced breast cancer, the addition of alpelisib to fulvestrant significantly improved median PFS (mPFS; 11.0 vs. 5.7 months, HR=0.65), ORR (27% vs. 13%), clinical benefit rate (62% vs. 45%), and numerically improved median OS (mOS; 39.3 vs. 31.4 months, HR=0.86) for patients with PIK3CA mutations (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Andre et al., 2021; 33246021); patients with wildtype PIK3CA did not experience significant mPFS benefit (7.4 vs. 5.6 months, HR=0.85) (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374). This trial excluded patients with active brain metastases; however, control of progressive brain metastases (1/4 PR and 2/4 SDs by response assessment in neuro_oncology brain metastases criteria) was reported in a case series of 4 patients with PIK3CA_mutated HR+, HER2_ breast cancer treated with alpelisib in combination with either fulvestrant or exemestane (Batalini et al., 2020; 32923889). The Phase 2 BYLieve study for previously treated patients with PIK3CA_mutated HR+, HER2_ advanced breast cancer reported an ORR of 19%, an mPFS of 7.3 months, and an mOS of 26.4 months for patients treated with alpelisib plus fulvestrant following progression on a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with an aromatase inhibitor (AI) (Ciruelos et al., 2021; SABCS Abstract P1_18_03); patients who progressed more quickly on their prior CDK4/6 inhibitor plus AI regimen (<6 months) experienced greater mPFS benefit from alpelisib plus fulvestrant (12.0 vs. 6.2 months) than patients who experienced delayed progression (>6 months) (Juric et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 1018). The Phase 2 BYLieve trial also reported an ORR of 16% and an mPFS of 5.7 months for patients treated with alpelisib plus letrozole following progression on a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with fulvestrant, benefit did not differ by duration of prior treatment (Rugo et al., 2020; SABCS Abstract PD2_07, Juric et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 1018), and an ORR of 24% and an mPFS of 5.6 months for patients treated with alpelisib plus fulvestrant who had previously progressed on aromatase inhibitors and received chemotherapy or endocrine therapy (Rugo et al., 2021; SABCS Abstract PD13_05). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04589845", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04341259", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03239015", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04337463", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04803318", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04526470", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05125523", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03772561", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03297606", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TSC1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "rearrangement intron 3", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "rearrangement intron 3"}}, "Interpretation": "TSC1 encodes the protein Hamartin, which interacts with Tuberin, the gene product of TSC2, to inhibit and regulate mTOR activity (Tee et al., 2003; 12906785, Inoki et al., 2003; 12869586). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TSC1 function or expression (Miloloza et al., 2000; 10915759, Hoogeveen_Westerveld et al., 2010; 20547222, Hodges et al., 2001; 11741833). TSC1 mutations have been reported in 0_1.5% of breast carcinomas (cBio_Shah et al., 2012; 22495314, cBio_Stephens et al., 2012; 22722201, cBio_Banerji et al., 2012; 22722202, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 23000897, cBio_Ciriello et al., 2015; 26451490). One study has reported decreased Hamartin protein expression in invasive breast carcinoma samples, as compared to normal epithelial breast tissue (Jiang et al., 2005; 15951164). Decreased Hamartin expression has been associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients (Jiang et al., 2005; 15951164). Loss or inactivation of TSC1 can activate mTOR signaling (Tee et al., 2003; 12906785, Mallela et al., 2021; 33575875); however, response rates for patients with TSC1_mutated solid tumors treated with MTOR inhibitors such as everolimus and temsirolimus have been low (Adib et al., 2021; 33727259, Nassar et al., 2020; 31653662, Voss et al., 2019; 30327302). In the prospective NCI_MATCH study, the ORR for patients with various TSC1_mutated solid tumors treated with everolimus was 7.7% (1/13); the single response was reported for a patient with urothelial cancer (Adib et al., 2021; 33727259). In TSC1_mutated renal cell carcinoma (RCC), although responses to MTOR inhibitors have been described in multiple case series and reports (Ali et al., 2015; 25796537, Lim et al., 2016; 26859683, Kwiatkowski et al., 2016; 26831717, Hamieh et al., 2018; 30256787, Roldan_Romero et al., 2020; 31335987), retrospective analysis of a broader cohort showed no responses in TSC1_mutated RCC (0/7) (Nassar et al., 2020; 31653662). Retrospective analyses of the RECORD_3, GRANITE_1, and EVOLVE_1 studies of everolimus to treat patients with RCC, gastric cancer, or hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively, showed no significant association between alterations in MTOR, TSC1, or TSC2 and median PFS (Voss et al., 2019; 30327302). PRs have been reported for patients with TSC1_altered perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (Wagner et al., 2021; 34637337, Kopparthy and Murphy, 2021; 34123648) and epithelial ovarian carcinoma (Dickson et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3111) treated with nab_sirolimus. Inactivating germline mutations in TSC1 are associated with the autosomal dominant disorder tuberous sclerosis complex, which results in the development of hamartomas in multiple organ systems and an increased risk of developing renal cell carcinoma (Gomez, 1991; 2039135, van Slegtenhorst et al., 1997; 9242607). TSC1 mutations account for approximately 10 to 30% of reported sporadic cases (Crino et al., 2006; 17005952). Prevalence for this disorder in the general population is estimated to be 1/6,000 from birth and 1/12,000 to 1/14,000 in children under 10 years of age (Curatolo et al., 2008; 18722871).

Alterations such as seen here may disrupt BAP1 function or expression (Ventii et al., 2008; 18757409, Chan_On et al., 2013; 24185513, Abdel_Rahman et al., 2011; 21941004, Testa et al., 2011; 21874000, Wiesner et al., 2011; 21874003, Farley et al., 2013; 23709298, Aoude et al., 2013; 23977234, Peng et al., 2018; 29284740, Nishikawa et al., 2009; 19117993, Zhang et al., 2018; 30202049). BAP1 somatic mutations are reported to be rare in breast cancer (Je et al., 2012; 22958294), and have been reported in 0.4_2% of breast invasive carcinoma cases (cBio_Stephens et al., 2012; 22722201, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 23000897, cBio_Ciriello et al., 2015; 26451490, cBio_Shah et al., 2012; 22495314). BAP1 has been suggested to play a tumor suppressive role in breast cancer cells by regulating genomic stability; high BAP1 expression was significantly associated with improved overall survival in patients with breast cancer, and with prolonged progression_free survival in patients with basal or luminal breast cancer (Zarrizi et al., 2014; 25228651). Clinical (Zauderer et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 8515) and preclinical (LaFave et al., 2015; 26437366) evidence in the context of mesothelioma suggests that tumors with BAP1 inactivation may be sensitive to EZH2 inhibitors such as tazemetostat. Preclinical studies suggest that BAP1 is involved in the DNA damage response (Yu et al., 2014; 24347639, Ismail et al., 2014; 24894717, Pe\u00f1a_Llopis et al., 2012; 22683710, Nishi et al., 2014; 25194926), and BAP1 inactivation might be associated with sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Pe\u00f1a_Llopis et al., 2012; 22683710, Ismail et al., 2014; 24894717, Zhang et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e23192). One preclinical study suggests that HDAC inhibitors may be beneficial in BAP1_mutated uveal melanoma; however, it is unclear if these inhibitors are effective in other BAP1_mutated cancers (Landreville et al., 2012; 22038994). One preclinical study suggests that BAP1 inactivation in breast cancer may be associated with resistance to tamoxifen (Mendes_Pereira et al., 2012; 21482774). BAP1 germline inactivating alterations, including mutations and deletions, are associated with BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome (BAP1_TPDS), an autosomal_dominant syndrome characterized by early onset of benign melanocytic skin tumors (Walpole et al., 2018; 30517737, Testa et al., 2011; 21874000, 23550303, Boru et al., 2019; 30883995). An estimated 2% of patients with BAP1_inactivated melanocytic tumors display germline BAP1 mutations (Garfield et al., 2018; 29753057). Later in life, patients have an increased risk of cancers such as uveal melanoma, mesothelioma, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and meningioma (Abdel_Rahman et al., 2011; 21941004, Testa et al., 2011; 21874000, Wiesner et al., 2011; 21874003, Farley et al., 2013; 23709298, Aoude et al., 2013; 23977234, Shankar et al., 2017; 28170043). In small studies, the prevalence of pathogenic germline BAP1 mutation has been reported as 22% in familial uveal melanoma and 4.4% in mesothelioma (Rai et al., 2017; 27718540, Zauderer et al., 2019; 31323388).

BCL2L2 amplification has been observed in 4% of prostate adenocarcinomas (cBio_Kumar et al., 2016; 26928463), 3.7% of pancreatic cancer (cBio_Witkiewicz et al., 2015; 25855536), 2.9% of sarcomas (cBio_Barretina et al., 2010; 20601955), 2.2% of lung adenocarcinomas (cBio_Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, cBio_Ding et al., 2008; 18948947), and 2.2% of ovarian serous cystadenocarcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2011; 21720365), with amplification rarer in other tumor types such as breast carcinoma (0.4_1.2%)(Ad\u00e9la\u00efde et al., 2007; 18089785, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 23000897, cBio_Ciriello et al., 2015; 26451490). Overexpression of BCL_W has been reported to be associated with tumor stage, differentiation status, and a poorer patient prognosis in multiple tumor types, including lung, gastric, ovarian, and colorectal tumors (Elstrand et al., 2009; 19620938, Kawasaki et al., 2007; 17459056, Lee et al., 2003; 12615727, Wilson et al., 2000; 10638987).

Both p15INK4b and p16INK4a bind to and inhibit CDK4 and CDK6, thereby maintaining the growth_suppressive activity of the Rb tumor suppressor; loss or inactivation of either p15INK4b or p16INK4a contributes to dysregulation of the CDK4/6_cyclin_Rb pathway and loss of cell cycle control (Gazzeri et al., 1998; 9484839, Roussel, 1999; 10498883). The tumor suppressive functions of p14ARF involve stabilization and activation of p53, via a mechanism of MDM2 inhibition (Sherr et al., 2005; 16869746, Ozenne et al., 2010; 20549699).

CDKN2B alterations such as seen here are predicted to inactivate p15INK4b (Jafri et al., 2015; 25873077). CDKN2A/B loss or mutation occurs in 4% and 1% of breast invasive carcinoma cases, respectively (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 23000897, cBio_Pereira et al., 2016; 27161491). CDKN2B is deleted in 33% of early_onset breast cancers (n=47), compared to 14% of late_onset breast cancers (n=59) (Sinha et al., 2008; 18239974). Expression of the mRNA transcripts encoding p16INK4a and p14ARF has been reported to be variable in breast carcinoma (Silva et al., 2003; 12579530). CDKN2B and CDKN2A methylation, including hypermethylation of the p16INK4a and p14ARF promoters, in breast tumors has been reported in 4_40% of breast carcinomas (Buyru et al., 2009; 19194828, Klajic et al., 2013; 24093668, Jung et al., 2013; 24205493, Moelans et al., 2013; 24287456, Silva et al., 2003; 12579530, Xu et al., 2010; 19921426, Sinha et al., 2008; 18239974). Loss of p16INK4a protein expression has been reported in breast carcinoma, including lobular and ductal carcinoma samples (Geradts and Ingram, 2000; 11007034, Singh et al., 2004; 15619212), and one study did not detect p14ARF protein in 21% of invasive ductal breast carcinomas (Vestey et al., 2004; 15318938). However, other studies report p16INK4a expression in 26_50% of breast cancer samples while p14ARF expression has been reported in 24% of breast tumors (Bogina et al., 2013; 23887295, Choi et al., 2013; 24373193, Coradini et al., 2002; 12402149, Vestey et al., 2004; 15318938). Methylation of the CDKN2A promoter has been shown to increase with tumor grade in ductal carcinoma in_situ (DCIS) (Klajic et al., 2013; 24093668, Moelans et al., 2011; 21710692), and is associated with increased breast cancer_specific mortality (Xu et al., 2010; 19921426). There have been conflicting reports about the association between p16INK4a or p14ARF expression and prognosis. Some studies have showed that the overexpression of p16INK4a may play a role in the progression of breast tumors (Chae et al., 2011; 21488187). Increased expression of p16INK4a in basal_like tumors has been suggested to be involved in the poor prognosis of this tumor type (Bohn et al., 2010; 20661408). However, p16INK4a expression has also been correlated with prolonged breast cancer_specific survival and disease_free survival (Peurala et al., 2013; 23336272, Bogina et al., 2013; 23887295, Choi et al., 2013; 24373193). Increased p14 expression were associated better overall and disease_free survival; p16 expression was not found to be associated with clinical outcome in this study (Wazir et al., 2013; 23645774). Analysis of the expression and mutational profile of CDKN2B suggests that loss of CDKN2B may play a role in the loss of control of growth but not in the progression of tumors (Stone et al., 1995; 7675459). Loss of p16INK4a may also associate with HER2 positivity and be less frequent in triple_negative breast carcinomas, which often inactivate Rb (Peurala et al., 2013; 23336272, Bogina et al., 2013; 23887295). Preclinical data suggest that tumors with loss of p16INK4a function may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, ribociclib, and palbociclib (Konecny et al., 2011; 21278246, Katsumi et al., 2011; 21871868, Cen et al., 2012; 22711607, Logan et al., 2013; 23898052). Clinical data in mesothelioma, breast cancer, and uterine leiomyosarcoma indicate that CDKN2A loss may predict sensitivity to abemaciclib (Fennell et al., 2022; 35157829) and palbociclib treatment (Elvin et al., 2017; 28283584, Gao et al., 2015; 26715889). However, multiple other clinical studies have shown no significant correlation between p16INK4a loss or inactivation and therapeutic benefit of these agents (Gopalan et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8077, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Konecny et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5557)(DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Johnson et al., 2014; 24797823); it is not known whether CDK4/6 inhibitors would be beneficial in this case. Although preclinical studies have suggested that loss of p14ARF function may be associated with reduced sensitivity to MDM2 inhibitors (Van Maerken et al., 2011; 21460101, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357), the clinical relevance of p14ARF as a predictive biomarker is not clear. Because the p15INK4b protein encoded by CDKN2B is known to inhibit CDK4, tumors with CDKN2B mutation or loss may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as ribociclib, abemaciclib, and palbociclib (Infante et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 2528, Shapiro et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 2500)(Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126). Germline CDKN2A mutation is associated with melanoma_pancreatic cancer syndrome, a condition marked by increased risk of developing malignant melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer (Whelan et al., 1995; 7666917). Mutation carriers within families may develop either or both types of cancer, and melanoma cases may be referred to as familial or hereditary melanoma (Hansson, 2010; 20687502, Hogg et al., 1998; 9479083). CDKN2A is the most implicated gene in familial melanoma, with germline mutations present in 16% to 20% of familial melanoma cases (De Unamuno et al., 2018; 29543703, Soura et al., 2016; 26892650, Huerta et al., 2018; 29405243). CDKN2A alteration has also been implicated in familial melanoma_astrocytoma syndrome, an extremely rare tumor association characterized by dual predisposition to melanoma and nervous system tumors (Kaufman et al., 1993; 8414022, Bahuau et al., 1998; 9622062, Chan et al., 2017; 28699883). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of CDKN2A is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}, {"Name": "CDKN2B loss", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "CDKN2B loss"}}, "Interpretation": "CDKN2A encodes two different, unrelated tumor suppressor proteins, p16INK4a and p14ARF, whereas CDKN2B encodes the tumor suppressor p15INK4b (Quelle et al., 1995; 8521522, Sharpless, 2005; 15878778). Both p15INK4b and p16INK4a bind to and inhibit CDK4 and CDK6, thereby maintaining the growth_suppressive activity of the Rb tumor suppressor; loss or inactivation of either p15INK4b or p16INK4a contributes to dysregulation of the CDK4/6_cyclin_Rb pathway and loss of cell cycle control (Gazzeri et al., 1998; 9484839, Roussel, 1999; 10498883). The tumor suppressive functions of p14ARF involve stabilization and activation of p53, via a mechanism of MDM2 inhibition (Sherr et al., 2005; 16869746, Ozenne et al., 2010; 20549699). One or more alterations observed here are predicted to result in p16INK4a loss of function (Ruas et al., 1999; 10498896, Jones et al., 2007; 17909018, Haferkamp et al., 2008; 18843795, Huot et al., 2002; 12417717, Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Gombart et al., 1997; 9324288, Yang et al., 1995; 7780957, Parry and Peters, 1996; 8668202, Greenblatt et al., 2003; 12606942, Yarbrough et al., 1999; 10491434, Poi et al., 2001; 11255261, Byeon et al., 1998; 9660926, Kannengiesser et al., 2009; 19260062, Lal et al., 2000; 10719365, Koh et al., 1995; 7777061, McKenzie et al., 2010; 20340136, Miller et al., 2011; 21462282, Arap et al., 1997; 905385, Scaini et al., 2014; 24659262, Jenkins et al., 2013; 23190892, Walker et al., 1999; 10389768, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). One or more alterations seen here are predicted to result in p14ARF loss of function (Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Itahana and Zhang, 2008; 18538737, Zhang and Xiong, 1999; 10360174, Zhang et al., 1998; 9529249, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). CDKN2B alterations such as seen here are predicted to inactivate p15INK4b (Jafri et al., 2015; 25873077). CDKN2A/B loss or mutation occurs in 4% and 1% of breast invasive carcinoma cases, respectively (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 23000897, cBio_Pereira et al., 2016; 27161491). CDKN2B is deleted in 33% of early_onset breast cancers (n=47), compared to 14% of late_onset breast cancers (n=59) (Sinha et al., 2008; 18239974). Expression of the mRNA transcripts encoding p16INK4a and p14ARF has been reported to be variable in breast carcinoma (Silva et al., 2003; 12579530). CDKN2B and CDKN2A methylation, including hypermethylation of the p16INK4a and p14ARF promoters, in breast tumors has been reported in 4_40% of breast carcinomas (Buyru et al., 2009; 19194828, Klajic et al., 2013; 24093668, Jung et al., 2013; 24205493, Moelans et al., 2013; 24287456, Silva et al., 2003; 12579530, Xu et al., 2010; 19921426, Sinha et al., 2008; 18239974). Loss of p16INK4a protein expression has been reported in breast carcinoma, including lobular and ductal carcinoma samples (Geradts and Ingram, 2000; 11007034, Singh et al., 2004; 15619212), and one study did not detect p14ARF protein in 21% of invasive ductal breast carcinomas (Vestey et al., 2004; 15318938).

Methylation of the CDKN2A promoter has been shown to increase with tumor grade in ductal carcinoma in_situ (DCIS) (Klajic et al., 2013; 24093668, Moelans et al., 2011; 21710692), and is associated with increased breast cancer_specific mortality (Xu et al., 2010; 19921426).

Clinical data in mesothelioma, breast cancer, and uterine leiomyosarcoma indicate that CDKN2A loss may predict sensitivity to abemaciclib (Fennell et al., 2022; 35157829) and palbociclib treatment (Elvin et al., 2017; 28283584, Gao et al., 2015; 26715889).

Overexpression of FGF23 by tumor cells can cause hypophosphatemia through excessive renal phosphate clearance (Shimada et al., 2001; 11344269), while germline gain_of_function (protein stabilizing) mutations in FGF23 cause autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (Xu and White, 2005; 15863037). FGF23 alterations have been reported with highest incidence in uterine carcinosarcoma (7.0%), ovarian carcinoma (6.5%), testicular germ cell cancer (5.4%), cutaneous melanoma (5.0%), low_grade glioma (4.9%), lung squamous cell carcinoma (4.5%), sarcoma (4.3%), colorectal adenocarcinoma (4.2%), lung adenocarcinoma (3.7%), and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (3.4%) (cBioPortal, 2022) (Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210).

FGF6 expression has been observed in several cancers (Iida et al., 1992; 1549352, Ropiquet et al., 2000; 10945637, Niini et al., 2002; 12399964) and was shown to be oncogenic in preclinical models (Marics et al., 1989; 2649847, Iida et al., 1992; 1549352). FGF6 has been reported as amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210) and may be biologically relevant in this context (Zack et al., 2013; 24071852, Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). Somatic alterations affecting FGF6 are infrequently documented, with the highest rates reported in penile cancer (4%), cutaneous melanoma (1_3%), stomach carcinoma (1_3%) and colorectal cancer (1%) (cBioPortal, COSMIC, Jan 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Amplification of FGF6 has been frequently observed in testicular germ cell cancer (5%) and ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (5%), and in 2_6% of lower_grade gliomas, glioblastomas, sarcomas, breast invasive carcinomas, uterine carcinosarcomas, lung squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), head and neck SCC, pancreatic adenocarcinomas, and esophageal carcinomas (cBioPortal, Jan 2022) (Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). FGF6 is co_localized with FGF23 and CCND2 at chromosomal locus 12p13 and has been reported to be co_amplified with these genes in 1.3% of patients with breast cancer (Parish et al., 2015; 25950492). FGF6 expression has been reported in 54% (14/26) of prostate cancer samples, which also frequently express FGFR4 (Ropiquet et al., 2000; 10945637).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI is extremely rare in breast cancer, reported in 0_1% of cases across studies (Anbazhagan et al., 1999; 10213220, Adem et al., 2003; 14520695, Horimoto et al., 2020; 32449246, Heeke et al., 2020; 32776290, Kurata et al., 2020; 31907878, Sivapiragasam et al., 2020; 33314633). The incidence of MSI is increased in triple_negative breast cancer (Heeke et al., 2020; 32776290, Kurata et al., 2020; 31907878, Sivapiragasam et al., 2020; 33314633) and in tumors with homologous recombination defects, such as mutations in BRCA1/2 (Heeke et al., 2020; 32776290, Sivapiragasam et al., 2020; 33314633). Notably, in Lynch syndrome\u2013related breast cancer, MSI has been reported in 51_85% of cases (Walsh et al., 2010; 20215533, Risinger et al., 1996; 8646682, De Leeuw et al., 2003; 12615735, Shanley et al., 2009; 19123071, Buerki et al., 2012; 22034109, Yee et al., 1994; 8137273). A prospective study of 123 patients with breast cancer treated with chemotherapy reported an increase in the incidence of MSI_H following chemotherapy treatment (from 0% pre_treatment to 19% post_treatment) and a significant association between MSI and tumor recurrence (Kamat et al., 2012; 22928966).

In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "NSD3 (WHSC1L1)", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "NSD3, also known as WHSC1L1, encodes an enzyme that mediates histone methylation (Kim et al., 2006; 16682010). NSD3 has been shown to be amplified in various cancers (Kang et al., 2013; 23011637, Chen et al., 2014; 24874471, Morishita et al., 2011; 21664949). In TCGA datasets, NSD3 amplification has been most frequently observed in lung squamous cell carcinoma (17%) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745), breast invasive carcinoma (13%) (cBio_Ciriello et al., 2015; 26451490), bladder urothelial carcinoma (9%) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 24476821), and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (9%) (HNSCC_Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2015; 25631445) samples (Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Amplification of at least one member of the NSD3_CHD8_BRD4 pathway has been associated with worse overall survival in ovarian high_grade serous carcinoma and endometrial cancer (Jones et al., 2017; 28781807). In endometrial cancers, amplification of this pathway was more frequent in endometrial serous and endometrioid serious_like carcinomas compared to low_grade endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinomas (Jones et al., 2017; 28781807).

Inactivating somatic alterations of PRDM1 have been shown to occur in approximately one quarter of activated B_cell type diffuse large B_cell lymphomas (ABC_DLBCL) but not in other DLBCL subtypes (Pasqualucci et al., 2006; 16492805). In contrast to this tumor suppressor role in lymphoma, BLIMP_1 activity has been hypothesized to promote cell migration and invasion based on cell culture models of lung cancer (Yu et al., 2012; 22438909).

Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 is one of the most commonly mutated genes in breast cancer; mutations in this gene have been identified in 27_37% of breast carcinoma samples (cBio_Banerji et al., 2012; 22722202, cBio_Stephens et al., 2012; 22722201, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 23000897, Alsner et al., 2008; 18465328, Alkam et al., 2013; 24004112, Uji et al., 2014; 23973262). TP53 mutations that are located within the region encoding the DNA binding domain are associated with poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer (Alsner et al., 2008; 18465328, Olivier et al., 2006; 16489069, V\u00e9gran et al., 2013; 23359294). TP53 mutation is also implicated in breast cancer susceptibility, as TP53 mutation carriers have an 18_60 fold increased risk for early onset breast cancer (Walsh et al., 2006; 16551709, Garber and Offit, 2005; 15637391, Apostolou and Fostira, 2013; 23586058). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "02", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "02"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB level associated with lower rates of clinical benefit from treatment with PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors compared with patients with tumors harboring higher TMB levels, based on several studies in multiple solid tumor types (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). A study of 3,969 patients with breast cancer reported a median TMB of 2.63 mutations per megabase (Muts/Mb), with 5% of cases harboring TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb; median TMB was significantly higher in hormone receptor (HR)_negative and HER2_negative tumors than HR_positive or HER2_positive tumors (Barroso_Sousa et al., 2020; 32067680). The Breast Invasive Carcinoma TCGA analysis reported an average (non_silent) mutation load of 0.84 Muts/Mb for luminal A tumors, 1.38 Muts/Mb for luminal B tumors, 2.05 Muts/Mb for HER2_enriched tumors, and 1.68 Muts/Mb for basal_like tumors (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 23000897). In breast cancer, TMB is significantly higher in recurrent versus primary tumors, metastatic versus localized cancers, triple_negative versus HR_positive tumors, and CDH1_mutated versus CDH1_wildtype tumors (Sokol et al., 2019; 30423024, Barroso_Sousa et al., 2020; 32067680, Chumsri et al., 2020; 32380464, Israel et al., 2020; SABCS Abstract PD9_09). Among metastatic tumors, TMB_high samples have been reported more frequently in invasive lobular carcinoma (9_17% of cases, depending on the TMB cutoff to designate TMB_high) than in invasive ductal carcinoma (2_8% of cases, depending on the cutoff), and TMB_high (at either cutoff) has not been observed in papillary carcinoma (Sokol et al., 2019; 30423024, Barroso_Sousa et al., 2020; 32067680, Chumsri et al., 2020; 32380464, Israel et al., 2020; SABCS Abstract PD9_09). Breast carcinoma harbors a median TMB of 3.8 muts/Mb, and 3.1% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb) (FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). In a large study of patients with breast cancer, hypermutation was more frequently observed in metastatic tumors than in primary tumors (Barroso_Sousa et al., 2020; 32067680). In a study of 14,867 patients with breast cancer, high TMB was associated with older age and metastatic disease but was not significantly associated with PD_L1 positivity using the TMB cutoff of \u226510 Muts/Mb (Chumsri et al., 2020; 32380464). In estrogen receptor_positive breast cancer, increased TMB in tissue samples (>mean of 1.25 Muts/Mb) associated with shorter OS (HR=2.02) in an analysis of the TCGA data (Haricharan et al., 2014; 24839032). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, increased tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Ott et al., 2019; 30557521, Cristescu et al., 2022; 35101941, Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). In the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors, significant improvement in ORR was observed for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) compared with those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526); similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). At the same TMB cutpoint, retrospective analysis of patients with solid tumors treated with any checkpoint inhibitor identified that tissue TMB scores \u2265 10 Muts/Mb were associated with prolonged time to treatment failure compared with scores <10 muts/Mb (HR=0.68) (Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). For patients with solid tumors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the CheckMate 848 trial, improved responses were observed in patients with a tissue TMB \u2265 10 Muts/Mb independent of blood TMB at any cutpoint in matched samples (Schenker at al., 2022; AACR Abstract 7845). However, support for higher TMB thresholds and efficacy was observed in the prospective Phase 2 MyPathway trial of atezolizumab for patients with pan_solid tumors, where improved ORR and DCR was seen in patients with TMB \u2265 16 Muts/Mb than those with TMB \u2265 10 and <16 Muts/Mb (Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409). Similarly, analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017;
