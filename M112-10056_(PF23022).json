APC interacts with beta_catenin and controls signaling in the WNT pathway, which regulates embryonic development and cell differentiation (Logan and Nusse, 2004; 15473860). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt APC function or expression (Eklof et al., 2001; 11707392, Liu et al., 2006; 16753179, Dikovskaya et al., 2010; 20144988, Murphy et al., 2007; 17410430, Aretz et al., 2004; 15459959). APC mutations have been found in 73% of tumors in the colorectal adenocarcinoma TCGA dataset (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696). In 1 study, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of APC was observed in 32% of colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (Christie et al., 2013; 23085758). The prognostic significance of APC mutations in sporadic CRC remains unclear (Quyn et al., 2008; 19110823). Solid tumors with WNT/beta_catenin pathway alterations, as seen here, were observed to have significantly less T_cell inflammation in one study (Luke et al., 2019; 30635339). There are no approved drugs targeting APC inactivation in cancer. Loss of APC function leads to accumulation of beta_catenin and upregulation of WNT pathway transcription programs (Zhan et al., 2017; 27617575), and potential therapeutic approaches to target this pathway include CBP/beta_catenin antagonists, which interfere with the ability of beta_catenin to interact with transcriptional co_activator CBP (Jung et al., 2020; 32037398, Krishnamurthy and Kurzrock, 2018; 29169144). In a Phase 1 trial of the CBP/beta_catenin antagonist E7386, 1 patient with APC_mutated small bowel adenocarcinoma achieved a PR with tumor shrinkage of _69% and response duration of 165 days (Kawazoe et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 473P); preclinical data support sensitivity of APC_deficient gastric or colorectal cancer models to E7386 (Yamada et al., 2021; 33408116, Kanda et al., 2022; 34837838). Germline mutations in APC are found in more than 90% of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) (Kerr et al., 2013; 23159591, Fearon, 2011; 21090969, Kastritis et al., 2009; 18844223).

Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. BRIP1 mutations have been reported in 3% of samples analyzed in the Colorectal Adenocarcinoma TCGA dataset (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696). Increased BRIP1 expression has been implicated in resistance to 5_fluorouracil treatment and increased recurrence in patients with colorectal cancer (Nakanishi et al., 2012; 22526901, Wang et al., 2015; 25645394). On the basis of clinical responses in ovarian cancer (Dougherty et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 5536, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594, Piha_Paul et al., 2018; AACR Abstract A096) and prostate cancer (Abida et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 793PD, Abida et al., 2020; 32086346), as well as clinical benefit in breast cancer (Dhawan et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 2527), loss or inactivation of BRIP1 may confer sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. It is not known whether these therapeutic approaches would be relevant in the context of alterations that have not been fully characterized, as seen here. Germline mutations in BRIP1 are associated with increased risk of breast, ovarian, and cervical cancers (Filippini and Vega, 2013; 23747889, Ren et al., 2013; 24301948, Seal et al., 2006; 17033622, Rafnar et al., 2011; 21964575, Ma et al., 2013; 23473757). Germline mutations in BRIP1 are also associated with Fanconi anemia (FA), a rare autosomal disorder that predisposes patients to a subset of cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), gynecological malignancies, and head and neck tumors (Alter, 2007; 18024606, Khincha and Savage, 2013; 24246701, Chandrasekharappa et al., 2013; 23613520); frequency estimates suggest an incidence of 3/1,000,000 individuals in Europe and the US, and a heterozygote carrier frequency of 1/181 to 1/300 in the US and Europe, respectively, with slightly higher rates in some populations, such as the Ashkenazi Jewish population (1/89) (Tischkowitz and Hodgson, 2003; 12525534, Khincha and Savage, 2013; 24246701).

Rucaparib has primarily been evaluated in the context of ovarian carcinoma, breast carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, and melanoma.

Objective responses were observed for 80% (32/40) of patients with BRCA1/2 mutations, for 29% (24/82) with high LOH, and for 10% (7/10) with low LOH (Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). In heavily pretreated patients with a germline BRCA1/2 mutation who had received 2_4 prior chemotherapy treatments and had a progression free interval of greater than 6 months, 65% (17/26) of patients achieved an objective response with rucaparib treatment (Shapira_Frommer et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5513). In a Phase 2 study evaluating rucaparib for patients with advanced breast or ovarian cancer and germline BRCA1/2 mutations, disease control was observed in 92% (12/13) of patients with ovarian cancer treated with oral rucaparib dosed continuously, but no objective responses were reported in breast cancer patients (n=23). However, 39% (9/23) of evaluable patients with breast cancer achieved SD lasting 12 weeks or more (Drew et al., 2016; 27002934). In a Phase 1 study of rucaparib treatment in patients with solid tumors, 3/4 patients with ovarian cancer and 1/1 patient with breast cancer given the recommended Phase 2 dose reported objective responses; all responders harbored BRCA1/2 mutations (Kristeleit et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 2573).

Similarly, although a Phase 1 trial for patients with CRC reported 2 SDs (3_9 months, n=11) for those on continuous olaparib plus irinotecan and 7 SDs (4_13 months, n=14) for those on an intermittent regimen of the 2 agents, pronounced toxicity and overall lack of anti_tumor activity precluded further development of this combination (Chen et al., 2016; 27075016). However, 2 case studies reported clinical benefit from olaparib_based regimens for 2 heavily pretreated patients with CRC that harbored alterations in homologous repair deficiency genes. Olaparib monotherapy enabled a reduction in tumor volume for a patient with CRC and a germline CHEK2 R117G mutation under loss of heterozygosity (Ghiringhelli et al., 2016; 28082821), and for a second patient whose CRC harbored 2 ATM mutations (E2977fs*2, I1294Nfs*8), off_label treatment with olaparib in combination with irinotecan enabled a 4_month SD, reduction in tumor markers, and symptomatic improvement (Papageorgiou et al., 2021; 35004311).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS colorectal cancers (CRCs) make up 70_85% of CRC cases (Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894). MSS colorectal cancers are molecularly heterogeneous, driven by diverse mechanisms such as extensive DNA methylation, oncogenic mutations in KRAS or BRAF, or chromosomal instability (Jass, 2007; 17204026). Multiple studies have shown that MSS CRCs have a worse prognosis than MSI_high tumors (Samowitz et al., 2001; 11535541, Elsaleh and Iacopetta, 2001; 12445368, Brueckl et al., 2003; 12820457, Guidoboni et al., 2001; 11438476, Gryfe et al., 2000; 10631274, Sinicrope et al., 2006; 16952542, Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Laghi and Malesci, 2012; 22722556). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60). For patients with chemotherapy_refractory microsatellite_stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), a Phase 3 trial reported no OS advantage from the combination of the PD_L1 inhibitor atezolizumab plus cobimetinib relative to regorafenib (8.9 vs. 8.5 months, HR=1.00); atezolizumab monotherapy similarly did not prolong OS (7.1 vs. 8.5 months, HR=1.19) (Ciardiello et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract LBA_004). For patients with MSS CRC, a Phase 2 study combining ipilimumab and nivolumab reported an overall DCR of 25% (10/40) (Parikh et al., 2021; DOI: 10.1038/s43018_021_00269_7). Two Phase 1 studies for patients with MSS CRC treated with regorafenib and nivolumab reported PFSs of 7.9 months (Fukuoka et al., 2020; 32343640) and 5.7 months (Kim et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1016/j.annonc.2020.04.073), and a patient with MSS CRC refractory to chemotherapy treated with the PD_1 inhibitor sintilimab and regorafenib reported a CR (Zhang et al., 2021; 34688262).

Patients with MSS CRC are more likely to benefit from postsurgical fluorouracil (FU)_based adjuvant therapy (Ribic et al., 2003; 12867608, Sargent et al., 2010; 20498393) but less likely to benefit from irinotecan chemotherapy (Fallik et al., 2003; 14522894).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "NRAS", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "wildtype", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "wildtype"}}, "Interpretation": "NRAS encodes a member of the RAS family of small GTPases that mediate transduction of growth signals.

No alterations in NRAS were identified in this case. The majority of colorectal cancers (CRCs) (91_98%) have been reported to lack NRAS mutations (Pentheroudakis et al., 2013; 23374602, Vaughn et al., 2011; 21305640, Janku et al., 2013; 23400451, De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739, Irahara et al., 2010; 20736745, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Schirripa et al., 2015; 24806288, Guo et al., 2018; 29666387).

TP53 mutations have been reported in up to 75% of colorectal cancer cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Goh et al., 1995; 7585578, Berg et al., 2010; 21103049, Han et al., 2013; 23700467, Peeters et al., 2013; 23325582, Malhotra et al., 2013; 23526092, Di Bartolomeo et al., 2013; 23821376, Fong et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 57). A study reported p53 expression in 49% of analyzed colorectal cancer cases (Wangefjord et al., 2013; 23337059). TP53 mutation has not been consistently demonstrated to be a significant independent prognostic marker in the context of CRC (Russo et al., 2005; 16172461, Fong et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 57). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "01", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "01"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Fabrizio et al., 2018; 30151257, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526). Elevated tumor mutational burden (TMB) has been reported in 8_25% of colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (George et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3587, Nagahashi et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e15103, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117, Shao et al., 2020; 33119110). Multiple studies have reported that up to 90% of hypermutated CRC cases exhibit high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI_H) and mismatch repair deficiency (MMR_D) (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). Increased TMB is significantly associated with MSI_H and MMR_D, with studies reporting that 100% of MSI_H CRCs harbor elevated TMB and conversely that 100% of tumors with low TMB harbor intact MMR (George et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3587, Nagahashi et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e15103, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). A subset of CRCs that harbor increased TMB but not MSI_H are driven by mutations in POLE, which leads to an \u201cultramutated\u201d phenotype with especially high TMB (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). Tumors with increased TMB harbor BRAF V600E mutations more frequently than those with low TMB (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117), whereas TMB_low tumors more frequently harbor mutations in TP53 and APC (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696). The prognostic value of tumor mutational burden (TMB) in colorectal cancer (CRC) is context_ and therapy_dependent. A study of tissue TMB (tTMB) in 145 CRC samples showed longer OS in TMB_high samples compared with TMB_low ones (Schwartz et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 572). Similarly, for patients with metastatic CRC treated with first_line chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab or cetuximab, high tissue TMB (tTMB_H) was associated with longer OS (Innocenti et al., 2019; 30865548). For patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, tTMB_H was associated with better 5_year relapse_free survival (Lee et al., 2019; 31285374). However, for patients with EGFR/BRAF_inhibitor_treated, BRAF_mutated microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic CRC, intermediate tTMB was associated with significantly poorer PFS and OS compared with TMB_low status; patients with primary resistance to EGFR/BRAF blockage had higher TMB than those sensitive to these therapies (Randon et al., 2022; 34933155). In a study for 61 patients with metastatic, MSS CRC treated with best standard of care, plasma TMB scores \u226528 Muts/Mb (approximately 14 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) were associated with reduced OS compared with plasma TMB scores <28 Muts/Mb (3.0 vs. 5.3 months, HR=0.76, p=0.007), whereas tTMB was not found to be prognostic in this population (Chen et al., 2020; 32379280, Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, increased tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Ott et al., 2019; 30557521, Cristescu et al., 2022; 35101941, Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). In the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors, significant improvement in ORR was observed for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) compared with those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526); similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). At the same TMB cutpoint, retrospective analysis of patients with solid tumors treated with any checkpoint inhibitor identified that tissue TMB scores \u2265 10 Muts/Mb were associated with prolonged time to treatment failure compared with scores <10 muts/Mb (HR=0.68) (Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). For patients with solid tumors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the CheckMate 848 trial, improved responses were observed in patients with a tissue TMB \u2265 10 Muts/Mb independent of blood TMB at any cutpoint in matched samples (Schenker at al., 2022; AACR Abstract 7845). However, support for higher TMB thresholds and efficacy was observed in the prospective Phase 2 MyPathway trial of atezolizumab for patients with pan_solid tumors, where improved ORR and DCR was seen in patients with TMB \u2265 16 Muts/Mb than those with TMB \u2265 10 and <16 Muts/Mb (Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409). Similarly, analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386). In CRC specifically, a retrospective analysis of immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy reported significantly improved OS for patients with tumors harboring TMB \u22659.8 Muts/MB compared with those with tumors with TMB <9.8 Muts/Mb (~ equivalency <12 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254). Another retrospective study reported that a TMB \u226512 Muts/Mb cutoff identifies >99% of MSI_High CRC cases but only 3% of MSS cases, indicating the utility of this cutoff for identification of patients with CRC likely to benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Fabrizio et al., 2018; 30151257).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "APC", "Alteration": "R945fs*10", "Title": "A Study of E7386 in Combination With Other Anticancer Drug in Participants With Solid Tumor", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "CBP, Beta_catenin, FGFRs, RET, PDGFRA, VEGFRs, KIT", "Locations": "Kurume (Japan), Matsuyama (Japan), Seodaemun (Korea, Republic of), Osakasayama (Japan), Nagoya (Japan), Kawasaki (Japan), Chuo_Ku (Japan), Koto_ku (Japan), Chiba (Japan), Kashiwa (Japan)", "NCTID": "NCT04008797", "Note": "Based on preclinical and limited clinical data, APC inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to CBP/beta_catenin interaction inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "APC", "Alteration": "R945fs*10", "Title": "A Study of E7386 in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Previously Treated Participants With Selected Solid Tumors", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1/2", "Target": "CBP, Beta_catenin, PD_1", "Locations": "Fukuoka (Japan), Osaka (Japan), Shizouka (Japan), Tokyo (Japan), Chiba_shi (Japan), Kashiwa (Japan), Sapporo shi (Japan), Glasgow (United Kingdom), Manchester (United Kingdom), London (United Kingdom)", "NCTID": "NCT05091346", "Note": "Based on preclinical and limited clinical data, APC inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to CBP/beta_catenin interaction inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "APC", "Alteration": "R945fs*10", "Title": "Study of E7386 in Participants With Selected Advanced Neoplasms", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "CBP, Beta_catenin", "Locations": "Glasgow (United Kingdom), Manchester (United Kingdom), London (United Kingdom), Sutton (United Kingdom)", "NCTID": "NCT03264664", "Note": "Based on preclinical and limited clinical data, APC inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to CBP/beta_catenin interaction inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "BRIP1", "Alteration": "E1222fs*7", "Title": "Study of Olaparib (MK_7339) in Combination With Pembrolizumab (MK_3475) in the Treatment of Homologous Recombination Repair Mutation (HRRm) and/or Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD)_Positive Advanced Cancer (MK_7339_007/KEYLYNK_007)", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "PARP, PD_1", "Locations": "Fukuoka (Japan), Seongnam_si (Korea, Republic of), Seoul (Korea, Republic of), Okayama (Japan), Nagoya (Japan), Tokyo (Japan), Kashiwa (Japan), Sapporo (Japan), Nedlands (Australia), Southport (Australia)", "NCTID": "NCT04123366", "Note": "BRIP1 inactivation may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of other DNA repair pathways, including inhibitors of PARP.
