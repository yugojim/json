HRD and consequent genomic LOH occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one or more of the homologous recombination pathway proteins, including BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51C, ATM, PALB2, and BRIP1 (Vanderstichele et al., 2017; 28950147, Watkins et al., 2014; 25093514, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2011; 21720365, Venkitaraman, 2003; 12736286). This sample harbors a genomic LOH score that has been shown to be associated with sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor rucaparib in platinum_sensitive, BRCA1/2 wild_type ovarian, peritoneal, or Fallopian tube carcinoma in both the treatment (Coleman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5540, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594) and maintenance (Coleman et al., 2017; 28916367) settings. In a study of more than 4,000 ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer samples, genomic LOH score \u2265 16% was identified in 24.2% of BRCA1/2 wild_type cases, deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation was identified in an additional 17.2% of cases, and the remaining 58.7% of cases had LOH score < 16% and were BRCA1/2 wild_type (Elvin et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 5512). Among the histological subtypes, LOH score \u2265 16% or BRCA1/2 mutation was reported in 42.4% of serous carcinomas, 37.6% of endometrioid carcinomas, 23.5% of carcinosarcomas, 20.6% of neuroendocrine carcinomas, 13.6% of clear cell carcinomas, and 8.1% of mucinous carcinomas; in BRCA1/2 wild_type samples, the median LOH score was significantly higher in serous as compared with non_serous cases (Elvin et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 5512). In ovarian carcinoma, the median LOH score is significantly higher for BRCA1/2_mutated cases than BRCA1/2 wild_type cases (22.2% vs. 9.8%) (Elvin et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 5512), and mutation or methylation of BRCA1, BRCA2, or RAD51C has been reported to be enriched in cases with increased genomic LOH (Wang et al., 2012; 22912389, Abkevich et al., 2012; 23047548). One study reported no association between LOH and either tumor stage or grade in ovarian serous carcinoma (Marquard et al., 2015; 26015868). In patients with high_grade serous ovarian carcinoma, the frequency of LOH has been reported to increase significantly with age (Pedersen et al., 2013; 23716468). On the basis of emerging clinical data in ovarian cancer, elevated genomic LOH may be associated with greater sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Coleman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5540, Coleman et al., 2017; 28916367, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). In platinum_sensitive, BRCA1/2 wild_type ovarian, peritoneal, or Fallopian tube carcinoma, rucaparib elicited significantly longer median PFS (7.2 vs. 5.0 months, HR=0.51) and improved ORR (33.3% vs. 9.6%, p=0.0003) for patients with LOH score \u2265 16% (Coleman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5540, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). In the maintenance setting in platinum_sensitive, BRCA1/2 wild_type patients, rucaparib was superior to placebo in both the LOH score \u2265 16% (median PFS, 9.7 vs. 5.4 months; HR=0.44) and LOH score < 16% (median PFS, 6.7 vs. 5.4 months; HR=0.58) cohorts (Coleman et al., 2017; 28916367). Similar results have been reported for maintenance treatment with niraparib in ovarian cancer (Mirza et al., 2016; 27717299) when using a different measure of HRD that includes genomic LOH (Telli et al., 2016; 26957554, Timms et al., 2014; 25475740). Increased LOH has also been associated with improved sensitivity to platinum_containing chemotherapy regimens in patients with ovarian or breast cancer (Wang et al., 2012; 22912389, Telli et al., 2015; 25847929, Isakoff et al., 2015; 25847936).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "On the basis of emerging clinical data in ovarian cancer, elevated genomic LOH may be associated with greater sensitivity to PARP inhibitors.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Rucaparib", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> The PARP inhibitor rucaparib is FDA approved to treat patients with metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and deleterious somatic or germline BRCA mutations.

Similarly, the Phase 3 PRIMA trial for patients with newly diagnosed advanced OC reported an extended mPFS from niraparib maintenance therapy after response to first_line platinum chemotherapy compared with placebo (13.8 vs. 8.2 months, HR=0.62); subgroup analysis showed that patients with HRD_positive OC experienced the longest mPFS, which was irrespective of BRCA mutational status (21.9 vs. 10.4 months, HR=0.43) (Gonzalez_Martin et al., 2019; 31562799). The Phase 2 QUADRA study evaluating niraparib monotherapy as late_line treatment for patients with relapsed high_grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer (HGSOC) reported a median OS (mOS) of 12.2 months for all HGSOC patients, with highest mOS seen for those with BRCA1/2_mutated and HRD_positive tumors (26.0 and 19.0 months, respectively) (Moore et al., 2019; 30948273).

Numerous Phase 2 studies have demonstrated significant clinical activity for patients with BRCA_mutated ovarian cancer, with response rates often significantly higher for patients with BRCA mutations than for those without (Fong et al., 2009; 19553641, Gelmon et al., 2011; 21862407), and for patients with platinum_sensitive (vs. platinum_resistant) cancer (Domchek et al., 2016; 26723501, Matulonis et al., 2016; 26961146, Gelmon et al., 2011; 21862407, Fong et al., 2010; 20406929). As maintenance therapy for patients with newly diagnosed or platinum_sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer, olaparib monotherapy demonstrated significantly improved median PFS (mPFS) and OS compared with placebo in the Phase 3 SOLO_1 study (Moore et al., 2018; 30345884) and multiple later_phase studies (Poveda et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6002, Pujade_Lauraine et al., 2017; 28754483, Ledermann et al., 2016; 27617661, Ledermann et al., 2012; 22452356, Ledermann et al., 2014; 24882434). At the 5_year follow_up of SOLO_1, olaparib continued to improve mPFS compared with placebo for patients with ovarian cancer (Banerjee et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 811MO). In the first study of PARPi rechallenge for patients with ovarian cancer, the Phase 3 OReO/ENGOT Ov_38 study of maintenance olaparib compared with placebo reported statistically improved mPFS for both patients with BRCA_mutated (4.3 vs. 2.8 months, HR=0.57) and BRCA_unmutated (5.3 vs. 2.8 months, HR=0.43) cancer; in an exploratory analysis of the BRCA_unmutated cohort, improved mPFS was reported regardless of homologous recombination deficiency status (Pujade_Lauraine et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA33). Olaparib has also been evaluated in combination with other therapies. A statistically superior median PFS (mPFS) from treatment with olaparib in combination with the VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab compared with bevacizumab monotherapy was reported in the Phase 3 PAOLA_1 study for patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer in the intent_to_treat population (22.1 vs. 16.6 months), the BRCA1/2_mutated population (37.2 vs. 21.7 months), and the BRCA1/2_wildtype population harboring homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)_positive status (28.1 vs. 16.6 months) (Ray_Coquard et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA2). For patients with platinum_sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer who previously progressed on chemotherapy, statistically increased mPFS was reported in a Phase 2 study of olaparib in combination with chemotherapy (12.2 months) compared with chemotherapy alone (9.6 months) (Oza et al., 2014; 25481791), as well as from treatment with the VEGFR inhibitor cediranib compared with olaparib monotherapy in a Phase 1/2 trial (Liu et al., 2014; 25218906). Combination treatment with cediranib and olaparib also demonstrated numerically longer mPFS compared with chemotherapy alone for patients with BRCA1/2_mutated platinum_sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer (10.5 vs. 18 months); however, improved clinical benefit was not observed for patients without BRCA1/2 mutation (mPFS 9.7 vs. 8.9 months) or for the overall intent_to_treat population (mPFS 10.3 vs. 10.4 months, ORR 71.3% vs. 69.4%) (Liu et al., 2022; 35290101). The Phase 2 CAPRI study for PARP inhibitor_resistant patients with HRD platinum_sensitive high_grade ovarian cancer treated with combination therapy of olaparib and the ATR inhibitor ceralasertib reported an ORR of 46% (n=13, 6 PRs) and a PFS of 7.5 months (Wethington et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 5516). For patients with PARP_resistant ovarian cancer, the combination of olaparib and the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib elicited improved clinical benefit (ORR 29%, DCR 89%) compared with adavosertib alone (ORR 23%, DCR 63%); however, in the BRCA_mutated cohort, no significant difference in clinical benefit was observed between the combination (ORR 19%) and monotherapy (ORR 20%) treatments (Westin et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 5505). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Talazoparib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> The PARP inhibitor talazoparib is FDA approved to treat HER2_negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutations.

MET has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210), with amplification positively correlating with protein expression in some cancer types (Ang et al., 2013; 23898085, Abou_Bakr and Elbasmi, 2013; 23996864, Ho et al., 2013; 24258573, Dziadziuszko et al., 2012; 22237262, Madoz_G\u00farpide et al., 2015; 26319934) and associating with therapeutic response to MET inhibitors in a variety of cancer types (Kwak et al., 2015; ASCO GI Abstract 01, Ou et al., 2011; 21623265, Schwab et al., 2014; 24192513, Lennerz et al., 2011; 22042947, Chi et al., 2012; 22162573, Palma et al., 2014; 25232318, Le et al., 2015; 25922291, Ali et al., 2015; 25882375, Kwak et al., 2015; 26432108). In the Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma TCGA dataset, amplification and mutation of MET has been found in 2% and 1% of cases, respectively (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2011; 21720365). In the literature, high_level polysomy or amplification of MET has been observed in 24% (21/89) of ovarian clear cell adenocarcinomas but in only 3% (3/86) of ovarian serous adenocarcinomas (Yamamoto et al., 2011; 21478826). MET overexpression has been reported in 22% (20/90) of ovarian clear cell adenocarcinomas but not in any of the 89 ovarian serous adenocarcinomas studied (Yamamoto et al., 2011; 21478826). Overexpression of c_Met was observed in 11% (15/138) patients with advanced ovarian or peritoneal cancer, which correlated with significantly poorer prognosis by univariate analysis and as a significant prognostic indicator of OS by multivariate analysis; patients with elevated c_Met expression correlated with reduced median OS (Sawada et al., 2007; 17308108). On the basis of extensive clinical evidence, MET amplification or activating mutations may predict sensitivity to MET_targeting therapies such as kinase inhibitors crizotinib, capmatinib, tepotinib, and cabozantinib.

Capmatinib has demonstrated clinical efficacy for patients with MET_amplified cholangiocarcinoma (Lefler et al., 2022; 35129063), as well as MET_amplified NSCLC, both as a monotherapy (Schuler et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9067, Wu et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P1.01_97, Wolf et al., 2020; 32877583) and in combination with an EGFR TKI for patients with concurrent activating EGFR mutations (Wu et al., 2018; 30156984, Gainor et al., 2020; 31864558, Gautschi et al., 2020; 31864554). Tepotinib has demonstrated efficacy for patients with MET_amplified hepatocellular carcinoma (Faivre et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 329) and NSCLC (Le et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9021) as a monotherapy as well as in combination with gefitinib for patients with MET_amplified and EGFR_mutated NSCLC (Yang et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT193, Park et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 477O, Wu et al., 2019; IASLC Abstract MA09.09). Savolitinib elicited responses for patients with MET_amplified gastric cancer either alone or in combination with docetaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834, Kim et al., 2019; 30695737). AMG 337 elicited an ORR of 50% (5/10), including 1 CR, for patients with MET_amplified gastric, esophageal, or gastroesophageal junction cancer (Kwak et al., 2015; ASCO GI Abstract 01). Patients with MET_amplified NSCLC (Spigel et al., 2013; 24101053) or MET_amplified gastric cancer (Catenacci et al., 2011; 22389872) treated with the MET_targeting antibody onartuzumab (MetMAb) achieved clinical responses. In addition, high MET expression has been suggested to predict patient response to therapies such as the monoclonal HGF_targeting antibody rilotumumab as well as the combination of ramucirumab and the monoclonal MET_targeting antibody emibetuzumab (Oliner et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract 4005, Harding et al., 2019; 31142504). The Phase 2 LUMINOSITY study of the MET antibody drug conjugate telisotuzumab vedotin (teliso_V) reported a 37% (19/52) ORR for patients with non_squamous EGFR_wildtype tumors; lower ORRs were observed for patients with squamous (11%, 3/27) or non_squamous EGFR_mutated (12%, 5/43) tumors (Camidge et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT179). A Phase 1 study showed that teliso_V plus osimertinib yielded an ORR of 56% (10/18) for patients with EGFR_mutated MET_overexpressing NSCLC who progressed on osimertinib, including ORRs of 56% (5/9) for patients with an EGFR L858R mutation and 67% (6/9) for those with an EGFR exon 19 deletion (Goldman et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 9013).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Activating MET alterations may confer sensitivity to MET inhibitors.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Cabozantinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Cabozantinib inhibits multiple tyrosine kinases, including MET, RET, VEGFRs, and ROS1.

A case report of one patient with chemotherapy resistant high_grade serious ovarian carcinoma harboring GOPC_ROS1 fusion experienced partial response following treatment with crizotinib (Dong et al., 2020; 32652753). Clinical benefit has been reported from crizotinib treatment in case studies of patients with ALK_positive ovarian or pelvic adnexal lesions thought to represent metastases from primary NSCLC (Jing et al., 2017; 28362192, Mushi et al., 2016; 28105150, Fujiwara et al., 2014; 24360322, Wang et al., 2016; 27472693), although one patient with primary ALK_positive NSCLC developed a progressing ALK_positive pelvic adnexal mass in the course of crizotinib treatment (West et al., 2014; 25541622). Crizotinib has demonstrated efficacy in patients with NSCLC and ALK rearrangements (Shaw et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9066, Lu et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9058, Yoshida et al., 2016; 27354483, Solomon et al., 2014; 25470694, Shaw et al., 2013; 23724913), ROS1 rearrangements (Moro_Sibilot et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 8065, Goto et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9022, Shaw et al., 2014; 25264305, Mazieres et al., 2015; 25667280, Scheffler et al., 2015; 25868855), an NTRK1 fusion (Vaishnavi et al., 2013; 24162815), or MET activation (Drilon et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 108, Vassal et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 2595, Camidge et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8001, Li et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 8090, Schrock et al., 2016; 27343443, Jorge et al., 2015; 26791794, Paik et al., 2015; 25971939, Mahjoubi et al., 2016; 26892698, Benderra et al., 2016; 26845121, Waqar et al., 2015; 25898962, Mendenhall and Goldman, 2015; 25898965, Jenkins et al., 2015; 25769807, Awad et al., 2016; 26729443, Jorge et al., 2015; 26791794, Schwab et al., 2014; 24192513, Zhang et al., 2016; 26724472, Ou et al., 2011; 21623265, Le et al., 2015; 25922291). Crizotinib has also benefited patients with MET_mutated renal cell carcinoma (Diamond et al., 2013; 23610116) and patients with MET_amplified gastroesophageal cancer, glioblastoma, and carcinoma of unknown primary (Lennerz et al., 2011; 22042947, Shi et al., 2012; 22162573, Palma et al., 2014; 25232318). While a Phase 1b study evaluating crizotinib for the treatment of patients with ALK_positive malignancies, reported ORR of 52.9% (9/17) and 66.7% (6/9) in patients with lymphoma and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMT), respectively, an ORR of 11.8% (2/17) was reported for patients with other types of tumors (Gambacorti_Passerini et al., 2017; ASH Abstract 4128). Whereas median PFS and median OS were not reached for patients with lymphoma or IMT, median PFS was 1.3 months and median OS was 8.3 months for patients with other tumor types, and the median duration of treatment was ~1 month relative to 1_3 years for patients with lymphoma or IMT (Gambacorti_Passerini et al., 2017; ASH Abstract 4128). A Phase 1 clinical trial of crizotinib in pediatric solid tumors reported objective responses in 14/79 patients, including nine CRs and five PRs; response was enriched in patients with activating alterations in ALK (Moss\u00e9 et al., 2013; 23598171). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Capmatinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Capmatinib is a selective MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is FDA approved to treat patients with non_small cell lung cancer harboring MET exon 14 skipping_associated alterations.

Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 alterations have been reported in 29_80% of ovarian tumors, with a higher incidence in high_grade pelvic (primary ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal) serous carcinoma, with incidence of 91_97% (Ahmed et al., 2010; 20229506, Wojnarowicz et al., 2012; 23029043, Kuhn et al., 2012; 21990067, Karst and Drapkin, 2010; 19746182, Gadducci et al., 2012; 22304686, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011; 21720365, Rechsteiner et al., 2013; 23965232, Okamoto et al., 1991; 1680546). TP53 alterations have also been reported in serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STICs) of the Fallopian tube, which are suggested to be precursor lesions of tubo_ovarian high grade serous carcinomas (MacDaniel et al., 2015; 26181193, Kindelberger et al., 2007; 17255760, Meserve et al., 2017; 28106106, Kurman and Shih, 2011; 21683865). Aberrant p53 expression has been associated with higher ovarian serous carcinoma grade (89_90% of high_grade vs. 6.6_9% of low_grade vs. 0% of benign) (Altman et al., 2013; 23558569, Giurgea et al., 2012; 23303020, Rajesh et al., 2007; 17883046). TP53 mutations have been reported to be more frequent in advanced stage (63%, 55/87) and higher grade (65%, 42/64) than earlier stage (31%, 14/45) and lower grade (41%, 7/17) ovarian carcinomas (Rechsteiner et al., 2013; 23965232). Meta_analysis has suggested that TP53 expression was associated with poorer survival in ovarian epithelial cancers, although the effect was modest and considerable variability was observed between studies (de Graeff et al., 2009; 19513073). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

Activation of the CSF3 receptor can lead to increased CSF3 response and promote cell proliferation and differentiation through JAK signaling (Plo et al., 2009; 19620628, Touw and Bontenbal, 2007; 17284707). Truncating CSF3R mutations, occurring within the cytoplasmic domain (aa 651\u2013836), or activating missense alterations, such as T618I, have been reported to be transforming and activate SRC family kinases and STAT3/5, with the JAK/STAT pathway reported to be activated to a lesser extent by cytoplasmic domain truncations than by missense variants (Mehta et al., 2014; 24170028, Maxson et al., 2013; 23656643, Zhang et al., 2017; 28439110). Somatic alterations in CSF3R have been reported at low frequencies in multiple solid tumors, including tumors of the skin (6.1%), endometrium (2.8%), stomach (2.4%), large intestine (2.2%), and at lower incidences in other tumor types (COSMIC, Jan 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). CSF3R activating mutations are frequently found in patients with atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) and chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL)(50_60%) (Gotlib et al., 2013; 23896413, Plo et al., 2009; 19620628, Maxson et al., 2013; 23656643). CSF3R mutations have also been reported in 3% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) cases and were associated with decreased overall survival and AML_free survival (Kosmider et al., 2013; 23774674). Oncogenic CSF3R mutations may differentially activate downstream signaling, with membrane_proximal point mutations T618I and T640N (also known as T617N) activating the JAK/STAT pathway and C_terminal truncations primarily activating SRC family kinases (Maxson et al., 2013; 23656643). Based on clinical (Maxson et al., 2013; 23656643, Dao et al., 2014; 25180155, Dao et al., 2018; ASH Abstract 350, Freedman et al., 2015; 26274939, Stahl et al., 2016; 27068405) and preclinical (Maxson et al., 2013; 23656643, Fleischman et al., 2013; 24081659, Plo et al., 2009; 19620628, Maxson et al., 2016; 26475333, Rohrabaugh et al., 2017; 28031554) data for membrane_proximal mutations and preclinical data (Mehta et al., 2014; 24170028, Zhang et al., 2017; 28439110, Rohrabaugh et al., 2017; 28031554) for truncations, activating CSF3R mutations may predict sensitivity to JAK2 inhibitors such as ruxolitinib. Preclinical data regarding the use of dasatinib in the context of CSF3R truncation is mixed, with an initial study reporting sensitivity to dasatinib (Maxson et al., 2013; 23656643) and subsequent studies demonstrating a lack of activity in vitro (Rohrabaugh et al., 2017; 28031554, Mehta et al., 2014; 24170028). A patient with atypical chronic myeloid leukemia harboring a CSF3R_SPTNA1 fusion with a breakpoint in the CSF3R C_terminal domain failed to respond to dasatinib (Sheng et al., 2017; 29025591). Co_occurrence of membrane_proximal mutations and truncation results in an aggressive clinical course, and while preclinical data suggest that ruxolitinib or dasatinib are ineffective in this context (Rohrabaugh et al., 2017; 28031554), a patient with CNL harboring CSF3R T618I and Q739* experienced a temporary hematological response on ruxolitinib (Gunawan et al., 2017; 28302714). Limited preclinical data suggest that the MEK inhibitor trametinib may be effective in the context of compound CSF3R mutations (Rohrabaugh et al., 2017; 28031554). A Phase 2 study of ruxolitinib in combination with regorafenib for patients with colorectal carcinoma and a Phase 3 trial of ruxolitinib with capecitabine for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer were terminated early due to lack of efficacy; it is unclear if ruxolitinib may be beneficial in the context of solid tumors.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Homologous Recombination status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "HRD Positive", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "HRD Positive"}}, "Interpretation": null, "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "MYCL1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "MYCL1 encodes a protein that regulates transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Hirvonen et al., 1991; 1954386).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI_high (MSI_H) has been reported in 1.6_19.7% of ovarian cancer samples (Segev et al., 2015; 26775351, Plisiecka_Ha\u0142asa et al., 2008; 18507046), including 3.8% (1/26) of ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinomas (Huang et al., 2015; 25195947), and 10.0% (3/30) of ovarian clear cell carcinomas (CCOCs) (Strickland et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5514). No association of MSI_H with stage or survival was found in patients with ovarian cancer (Segev et al., 2015; 26775351, Aysal et al., 2012; 22189970). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "PRKCI", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "PRKCI encodes protein kinase C iota (PKCi), which has been reported to play roles in heart and spinal cord development (Rohr et al., 2006; 16319113, Roberts and Appel, 2009; 19449304). In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), PRKCI amplification strongly correlates with PKCi protein overexpression (Yang et al., 2008; 17990328). PRKCI has been reported to be frequently amplified in lung SCC, ovarian cancer, and esophageal SCC (Yang et al., 2008; 17990328, Justilien et al., 2014; 24525231, Zhang et al., 2006; 16651413). PRKCI amplification and/or protein overexpression has been associated with inferior patient prognosis and/or adverse clinico_pathological features in esophageal SCC, cholangiocarcinoma, lung, breast, pancreatic, gastric, ovarian, and brain cancers (Yang et al., 2008; 17990328, Patel et al., 2008; 18211289, Regala et al., 2005; 15994303, Kojima et al., 2008; 18538170, Scotti et al., 2010; 20179210, Takagawa et al., 2010; 19774416, Zhang et al., 2006; 16651413, Li et al., 2008; 18234642). In preclinical studies, genetic inhibition of PKCi expression has been shown to have anti_tumorigenic effects in xenografted and/or cultured cells of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, non_small cell lung cancer, glioma, and pancreatic, ovarian, and colon carcinoma (Kikuchi et al., 2013; 22349825, Stallings_Mann et al., 2006; 16452237, Regalo et al., 2009; 19738040, Scotti et al., 2010; 20179210, Zhang et al., 2006; 16651413, Murray et al., 2004; 15024028, Patel et al., 2008; 18211289). In preclinical studies, the PKCi inhibitor aurothiomalate has been shown to have anti_tumorigenic effects in lung cancer and rhabdomyosarcoma cells (Regala et al., 2009; 19738040, Kikuchi et al., 2013; 22349825, Stallings_Mann et al., 2006; 16452237). A Phase 1 escalation trial of aurothiomalate in patients with advanced lung, ovarian, or pancreatic cancer reported 2/11 enrolled patients achieving stable disease (Mansfield et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 2551). Other PKCi inhibitors with improved PKCi selectivity, such as CRT0066854 and ICA_1, are in preclinical development (Desai et al., 2012; AACR Abstract 3760)(Kj\u00e6r et al., 2013; 23418854). In preclinical models, PKCi activation has been reported to promote hedgehog signaling (Justilien et al., 2014; 24525231) as well as RAS signaling and to require the RAC1_MEK_ERK pathway for tumorigenesis (Regala et al., 2005; 15994303, Scotti et al., 2010; 20179210, Murray et al., 2004; 15024028, Fields et al., 2007; 17956262). Therefore, MEK inhibitors may be beneficial for a patient with PRKCI amplification. MEK inhibitors are in clinical trials in multiple cancer types. The MEK inhibitors cobimetinib and trametinib are approved for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations and are being studied in clinical trials in multiple cancer types (Larkin et al., 2014; 25265494, Flaherty et al., 2012; 22663011).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TERC", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "TERC, the human telomerase RNA gene (hTERC), encodes the RNA component of the telomerase enzyme. Telomerase is an RNA polymerase that maintains telomeric DNA and plays a role in senescence and oncogenesis (Wyatt et al., 2010; 20460453). In the TCGA datasets, amplification of TERC has most frequently been observed in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC; 34_43%) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745), ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (21_34%) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2011; 21720365), esophageal carcinoma (26%), cervical SCC and endocervical adenocarcinoma (20%), head and neck SCC (19_20%) (HNSCC_Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2015; 25631445), non_small cell lung cancer (18%) (cBio_Rizvi et al., 2018; 29337640), and uterine carcinosarcoma (14%; 8/57) (cBioPortal, Jan 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Studies have shown that TERC amplification is common in cervical cancer and that gain of the 3q chromosome arm predicts advanced grade and disease progression (Heselmeyer_Haddad et al., 2005; 15793301, Jiang et al., 2010; 20864639).

This sample harbors a TMB level associated with lower rates of clinical benefit from treatment with PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors compared with patients with tumors harboring higher TMB levels, based on several studies in multiple solid tumor types (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). Ovarian carcinomas, including peritoneal and Fallopian tube carcinomas, harbor a median TMB of 2.7_3.6 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb) depending upon subtype, and up to 2.1% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). In a study of high grade serous ovarian cancer, homologous recombination (HR)_deficient tumors, which comprised ~50% of all samples, harbored a higher neoantigen load compared to HR_proficient tumors; higher neoantigen load was associated with longer OS but not disease free survival (Strickland et al., 2016; 26871470).

In multiple pan_tumor studies, increased tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Ott et al., 2019; 30557521, Cristescu et al., 2022; 35101941, Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). In the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors, significant improvement in ORR was observed for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) compared with those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526); similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). At the same TMB cutpoint, retrospective analysis of patients with solid tumors treated with any checkpoint inhibitor identified that tissue TMB scores \u2265 10 Muts/Mb were associated with prolonged time to treatment failure compared with scores <10 muts/Mb (HR=0.68) (Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). For patients with solid tumors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the CheckMate 848 trial, improved responses were observed in patients with a tissue TMB \u2265 10 Muts/Mb independent of blood TMB at any cutpoint in matched samples (Schenker at al., 2022; AACR Abstract 7845). However, support for higher TMB thresholds and efficacy was observed in the prospective Phase 2 MyPathway trial of atezolizumab for patients with pan_solid tumors, where improved ORR and DCR was seen in patients with TMB \u2265 16 Muts/Mb than those with TMB \u2265 10 and <16 Muts/Mb (Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409). Similarly, analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017;
