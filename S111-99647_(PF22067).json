Amino acids 140 and 172 are hotspots for cancer_related mutations in IDH2 (Jin et al., 2011; 21326614). Functional studies have reported that mutation of R140 or R172, such as observed here, alters IDH2 enzymatic activity, resulting in gain_of_function activity and the production of the potential oncometabolite, D_2_hydroxyglutarate (2_HG)(Kranendijk et al., 2011; 21889589, Gross et al., 2010; 20142433, Jin et al., 2011; 21326614, Reitman and Yan, 2010; 20513808, Ward et al., 2010; 20171147, Dang et al., 2010; 20692206). This leads to downstream effects that are associated with tumorigenesis (Amary et al., 2011; 21598255, Gross et al., 2010; 20142433), and research suggests that hotspot IDH gene mutations could be early stage events in specific cancers (Amary et al., 2011; 21598255, Cardaci and Ciriolo, 2012; 22888353). IDH2 mutations have been reported in 5_7% of oligodendrogliomas analyzed in the COSMIC database, nearly all of which were substitutions at R172 (COSMIC, Jun 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Another large study in glioma reported IDH2 mutation in 2.5% (5/203) of cases (Qi et al., 2011; 21874255). Studies have reported IDH mutation (IDH1 or IDH2) in 54% (23/43) and 100% (16/16) of oligodendrogliomas analyzed, although IDH1 mutation was more prevalent, with IDH2 in just 1/43 and 2/16 samples (Frenel et al., 2013; 23681562, Yip et al., 2012; 22072542). Studies have reported that IDH mutation (IDH1 or IDH2) was associated with improved overall survival in glioma, including oligodendroglioma (Qi et al., 2011; 21874255, Shibahara et al., 2012; 21971842, Frenel et al., 2013; 23681562). This improvement in overall survival may be due to increased radiation sensitivity in gliomas with IDH mutation (Li et al., 2013; 23115158). In the context of IDH_mutated gliomas, TERT mutations are associated with improved OS (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021)(Arita et al., 2020; 33228806). IDH1/2 mutations are a strong favorable prognostic marker for OS in Grade 2_3 glioma, particularly in combination with 1p/19q codeletion (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021). On the basis of preclinical data and clinical responses for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IDH2 mutations may predict response to selective IDH2 inhibitors such as enasidenib (Stein et al., 2017; 28588020, Yen et al., 2017; 28193778, Amatangelo et al., 2017; 28588019, Stein et al., 2017; ASH Abstract 726). In Phase 1/2 studies of enasidenib for patients with IDH2_mutated advanced hematological malignancies, overall response rates of 40% and 53% were achieved for patients with relapsed/refractory AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), respectively (Stein et al., 2017; 28588020, Stein et al., 2016; ASH Abstract 343). On the basis of extensive clinical data in AML and limited data in MDS, IDH2 mutations may also predict response to the combination of the BCL_2 inhibitor venetoclax and a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor such as azacitidine or decitabine (Pollyea et al., 2018; ASH Abstract 285, Aldoss et al., 2018; 29545346, DiNardo et al., 2018; 29218851, Andreani et al., 2019; 30431666, Winters et al., 2019; 31648312, DiNardo et al., 2019; 30361262, Wang et al., 2020; 31965269, Morsia et al., 2020; 3283329, Zeidan et al., 2021; ASH Abstract 537), or to single_agent venetoclax (Konopleva et al., 2014; ASH Abstract 118, Konopleva et al., 2016; 27520294, Chan et al., 2015; 25599133, Wei et al., 2018; ASH Abstract 284, Wei et al., 2018; ASH Abstract 333), azacitidine, or decitabine (Figueroa et al., 2010; 21130701, Turcan et al., 2012; 22343889, Emadi et al., 2015; 25651001, DiNardo et al., 2014; 24138309, Metzeler et al., 2012; 22124213, Traina et al., 2014; 24045501). Limited clinical data also indicate that IDH2 mutations may predict sensitivity to the combination of enasidenib and azacitidine (DiNardo et al., 2017; ASH Abstract 639) or to glutaminase inhibitors such as telaglenastat (Wang et al., 2015; ASH Abstract 2566). A patient with previously treated IDH2_mutated AML experienced a CR longer than 14 months with incomplete hematologic recovery on telaglenastat monotherapy (Wang et al., 2015; ASH Abstract 2566). IDH1/2 mutations are associated with improved survival outcomes for patients with glioma treated with radiation or alkylating chemotherapy (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021). Co_occurring TERT mutation, IDH mutation, and 1p/19q co_deletion is indicative of oligodendroglioma (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021)(Weller et al., 2020; 33293629). IDH1/2 mutation is associated with Grade 2 and 3 astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, and distinguishes secondary glioblastoma (GBM) from primary GBM (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "IDH2 mutations may predict sensitivity to IDH2 inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": {"nctId": "NCT04762602", "Include": "true"}}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). Low_level MSI has been reported in 5_9% of glioblastoma (GBM) samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927, Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285, Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). A large_scale study did not find high_level microsatellite instability (MSI_H) in any of 129 GBM samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), although a small_scale study reported MSI_H in 4 of 15 pediatric GBMs and 1 of 12 adult GBMs (Szybka et al., 2003; 12908754). A pediatric patient with Lynch syndrome but MSS was reported to develop anaplastic oligodendroglioma (Heath et al., 2013; 23255519). The frequency of MSI has been reported to be increased in relapsed compared to primary GBM (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), in GBMs with a previous lower grade astrocytoma (Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285), and in giant cell GBM compared to classic GBM (Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). A case study of a pediatric patient with glioblastoma with an oligodendroglioma component was reported to harbor MSI_high, which was proposed to be a possible mechanism of resistance to temozolomide treatment (Mizoguchi et al., 2013; 23530875). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "NOTCH1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": [{"Name": "C750fs*1", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "C750fs*1"}}, "Interpretation": "NOTCH1 encodes a member of the NOTCH family of receptors, which are involved in cell fate determination and various developmental processes. Depending on cellular context, NOTCH1 can act as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene (Wang et al., 2011; 22006338, Klinakis et al., 2011; 21562564). Upon binding of membrane_bound ligands, the NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD) is cleaved and forms part of a transcription factor complex that regulates downstream target genes involved in cell fate determination, proliferation, and apoptosis (Penton et al., 2012; 22306179, Kopan and Ilagan, 2009; 19379690). NOTCH1 rearrangements and fusions, including SEC16A_NOTCH1, that eliminate the NOTCH1 extracellular domain but retain the transmembrane and intracellular domains have been observed in patients with breast cancer (Edwards and Howarth., 2012; 22424054, Robinson et al., 2011; 22101766) and T_cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T_ALL) (Haydu et al., 2012; 22510873), and have been reported to cause ligand_independent activation of NOTCH1 transcriptional activity and are gamma_secretase inhibitor (GSI)_sensitive (Robinson et al., 2011; 22101766, Palomero et al., 2006; 16688224, Haydu et al., 2012; 22510873, Ashworth et al., 2010; 20852131, Sakamoto et al., 2005; 15561108). One or more alterations observed here have not been fully characterized or form fusions with non_canonical breakpoints, and the effect on NOTCH1 function is unclear; however, similar NOTCH1 rearrangements have been reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. NOTCH1 alterations that disrupt ligand binding (Andrawes et al., 2013; 23839946, Rebay et al., 1991; 1657403, Ge et al., 2008; 18445292) or remove the transmembrane domain (amino acids 1736_1756), RAM domain (amino acids 1757_1926), ankyrin repeats (amino acids 1927_2122) and/or transactivation domain (amino acids 2123_2374) that are necessary for NOTCH1 function, such as observed here, are predicted to be inactivating (Aster et al., 2000; 11003647, Weng et al., 2004; 15472075, Kopan and Ilagan, 2009; 19379690, Deregowski et al., 2006; 16869730). Several point mutations, including D469G, A465T, C478F, R1594Q, and P1770S, have also been reported to inactivate NOTCH1 (Wang et al., 2011; 22006338, Uchibori et al., 2017; 28791383, Liu et al., 2013; 24277854). One or more of the NOTCH1 alterations observed here have not been characterized, and the effect on NOTCH1 function is not known. NOTCH1 mutation has been observed in 11% of lower grade glioma cases analyzed (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751, cBio_Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570). NOTCH1 mutation is rare in glioblastoma and has been observed in 0_1.7% of cases, but has been reported in 19_27% of oligodendrogliomas (COSMIC, cBioPortal, Mar 2022)(cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890, Yip et al., 2012; 22072542, Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). NOTCH1 expression has been observed in 60%, 67_68%, 85_93%, and 92_100% of grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 astrocytoma samples, respectively (Xu et al., 2010; 19771395, Xu et al., 2009; 19424825). In one study of 18 pilocytic astrocytomas (PA) and 4 low grade astrocytomas, NOTCH1 mRNA over_expression was observed in 95% (21/22) of cases (Brandt et al., 2015; 25575134). In addition, the NOTCH1 target, HES1, exhibited moderate to strong protein expression via immunohistochemistry in 66% (40/61) PA samples compared to non_neoplastic brain samples (Brandt et al., 2015; 25575134). NOTCH1 expression was significantly increased from Grade 1 to Grade 4 gliomas and was associated with glioma progression (Jiang et al., 2011; 21251836), as well as with tumor grade and tumor proliferation activity in astrocytoma (Xu et al., 2010; 19771395, Xu et al., 2009; 19424825). NOTCH1 inhibitors and gamma_secretase inhibitors (GSIs) may be potential therapeutic approaches in the case of NOTCH1 activating mutations (Debeb et al., 2012; 22547109, Fouladi et al., 2011; 21825264, Groth and Fortini, 2012; 22309842, Kamstrup et al., 2010; 20538790, Kridel et al., 2012; 22210878, Krop et al., 2012; 22547604, Rosati et al., 2013; 23001755, Samon et al., 2012; 22504949, Lehal et al., 2020; 32601208, Lopez_Miranda et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3020). In a Phase 2 study, the GSI AL101 (BMS_906024) elicited PRs in 15% (6/39) and SDs in 54% (21/39) of patients with metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) harboring NOTCH activating alterations (Ferrarotto et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 919MO). Additional responses to AL101 have been reported in a patient with gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma harboring multiple NOTCH1 mutations, a patient with T_cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T_ALL) harboring a NOTCH1 HD domain mutation, and a patient with ACC harboring a single NOTCH1 mutation (El_Khoueiry et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 2515, Knoechel et al., 2015; 27148573). A Phase 1 study of the pan_NOTCH inhibitor CB_103 for patients with advanced or recurrent solid tumors reported a preliminary mPFS of 21.7 weeks for patients with ACC, with 2 patients harboring NOTCH1_mutated ACC demonstrating SD > 6 months as best response (Lopez_Miranda et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3020). On the basis of clinical data in non_Hodgkin lymphoma, NOTCH1 activating alterations may be associated with sensitivity to the approved PI3K inhibitor copanlisib (Dreyling et al., 2017; 28633365); this is further supported by limited preclinical data that suggest that NOTCH1 may be a negative regulator of PTEN (Palomero et al., 2007; 17873882, Liu et al., 2013; 21993533). It is not known whether these therapeutic approaches would be relevant in the context of alterations that have not been fully characterized, as seen here. While activating mutations may be targeted via gamma_secretase inhibitors or PI3K inhibitors, there are no therapies available to address NOTCH1 inactivation, as seen here.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}, {"Name": "F357del", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "F357del"}}, "Interpretation": "NOTCH1 encodes a member of the NOTCH family of receptors, which are involved in cell fate determination and various developmental processes.

NOTCH1 inhibitors and gamma_secretase inhibitors (GSIs) may be potential therapeutic approaches in the case of NOTCH1 activating mutations (Debeb et al., 2012; 22547109, Fouladi et al., 2011; 21825264, Groth and Fortini, 2012; 22309842, Kamstrup et al., 2010; 20538790, Kridel et al., 2012; 22210878, Krop et al., 2012; 22547604, Rosati et al., 2013; 23001755, Samon et al., 2012; 22504949, Lehal et al., 2020; 32601208, Lopez_Miranda et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3020). In a Phase 2 study, the GSI AL101 (BMS_906024) elicited PRs in 15% (6/39) and SDs in 54% (21/39) of patients with metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) harboring NOTCH activating alterations (Ferrarotto et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 919MO). Additional responses to AL101 have been reported in a patient with gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma harboring multiple NOTCH1 mutations, a patient with T_cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T_ALL) harboring a NOTCH1 HD domain mutation, and a patient with ACC harboring a single NOTCH1 mutation (El_Khoueiry et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 2515, Knoechel et al., 2015; 27148573). A Phase 1 study of the pan_NOTCH inhibitor CB_103 for patients with advanced or recurrent solid tumors reported a preliminary mPFS of 21.7 weeks for patients with ACC, with 2 patients harboring NOTCH1_mutated ACC demonstrating SD > 6 months as best response (Lopez_Miranda et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3020). On the basis of clinical data in non_Hodgkin lymphoma, NOTCH1 activating alterations may be associated with sensitivity to the approved PI3K inhibitor copanlisib (Dreyling et al., 2017; 28633365); this is further supported by limited preclinical data that suggest that NOTCH1 may be a negative regulator of PTEN (Palomero et al., 2007; 17873882, Liu et al., 2013; 21993533). It is not known whether these therapeutic approaches would be relevant in the context of alterations that have not been fully characterized, as seen here. While activating mutations may be targeted via gamma_secretase inhibitors or PI3K inhibitors, there are no therapies available to address NOTCH1 inactivation, as seen here.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}, {"Name": "duplication exons 8_25", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "duplication exons 8_25"}}, "Interpretation": "NOTCH1 encodes a member of the NOTCH family of receptors, which are involved in cell fate determination and various developmental processes. Depending on cellular context, NOTCH1 can act as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene (Wang et al., 2011; 22006338, Klinakis et al., 2011; 21562564). Upon binding of membrane_bound ligands, the NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD) is cleaved and forms part of a transcription factor complex that regulates downstream target genes involved in cell fate determination, proliferation, and apoptosis (Penton et al., 2012; 22306179, Kopan and Ilagan, 2009; 19379690). NOTCH1 rearrangements and fusions, including SEC16A_NOTCH1, that eliminate the NOTCH1 extracellular domain but retain the transmembrane and intracellular domains have been observed in patients with breast cancer (Edwards and Howarth., 2012; 22424054, Robinson et al., 2011; 22101766) and T_cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T_ALL) (Haydu et al., 2012; 22510873), and have been reported to cause ligand_independent activation of NOTCH1 transcriptional activity and are gamma_secretase inhibitor (GSI)_sensitive (Robinson et al., 2011; 22101766, Palomero et al., 2006; 16688224, Haydu et al., 2012; 22510873, Ashworth et al., 2010; 20852131, Sakamoto et al., 2005; 15561108). One or more alterations observed here have not been fully characterized or form fusions with non_canonical breakpoints, and the effect on NOTCH1 function is unclear; however, similar NOTCH1 rearrangements have been reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. NOTCH1 alterations that disrupt ligand binding (Andrawes et al., 2013; 23839946, Rebay et al., 1991; 1657403, Ge et al., 2008; 18445292) or remove the transmembrane domain (amino acids 1736_1756), RAM domain (amino acids 1757_1926), ankyrin repeats (amino acids 1927_2122) and/or transactivation domain (amino acids 2123_2374) that are necessary for NOTCH1 function, such as observed here, are predicted to be inactivating (Aster et al., 2000; 11003647, Weng et al., 2004; 15472075, Kopan and Ilagan, 2009; 19379690, Deregowski et al., 2006; 16869730). Several point mutations, including D469G, A465T, C478F, R1594Q, and P1770S, have also been reported to inactivate NOTCH1 (Wang et al., 2011; 22006338, Uchibori et al., 2017; 28791383, Liu et al., 2013; 24277854). One or more of the NOTCH1 alterations observed here have not been characterized, and the effect on NOTCH1 function is not known. NOTCH1 mutation has been observed in 11% of lower grade glioma cases analyzed (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751, cBio_Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570). NOTCH1 mutation is rare in glioblastoma and has been observed in 0_1.7% of cases, but has been reported in 19_27% of oligodendrogliomas (COSMIC, cBioPortal, Mar 2022)(cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890, Yip et al., 2012; 22072542, Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). NOTCH1 expression has been observed in 60%, 67_68%, 85_93%, and 92_100% of grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 astrocytoma samples, respectively (Xu et al., 2010; 19771395, Xu et al., 2009; 19424825). In one study of 18 pilocytic astrocytomas (PA) and 4 low grade astrocytomas, NOTCH1 mRNA over_expression was observed in 95% (21/22) of cases (Brandt et al., 2015; 25575134). In addition, the NOTCH1 target, HES1, exhibited moderate to strong protein expression via immunohistochemistry in 66% (40/61) PA samples compared to non_neoplastic brain samples (Brandt et al., 2015; 25575134). NOTCH1 expression was significantly increased from Grade 1 to Grade 4 gliomas and was associated with glioma progression (Jiang et al., 2011; 21251836), as well as with tumor grade and tumor proliferation activity in astrocytoma (Xu et al., 2010; 19771395, Xu et al., 2009; 19424825). NOTCH1 inhibitors and gamma_secretase inhibitors (GSIs) may be potential therapeutic approaches in the case of NOTCH1 activating mutations (Debeb et al., 2012; 22547109, Fouladi et al., 2011; 21825264, Groth and Fortini, 2012; 22309842, Kamstrup et al., 2010; 20538790, Kridel et al., 2012; 22210878, Krop et al., 2012; 22547604, Rosati et al., 2013; 23001755, Samon et al., 2012; 22504949, Lehal et al., 2020; 32601208, Lopez_Miranda et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3020).

Activation of TERT is a hallmark of cancer, being detected in up to 80_90% of malignancies and absent in quiescent cells (Shay et al., 1997; 9282118, Kim et al., 1994; 7605428, Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000; 10647931). Mutations within the promoter region of TERT that confer enhanced TERT promoter activity have been reported in two hotspots, located at _124 bp and _146 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (also termed C228T and C250T, respectively)(Horn et al., 2013; 23348503, Huang et al., 2014; 23348506, Vinagre et al., 2013; 23887589), as well as tandem mutations at positions \u2013124/\u2013125 bp and \u2013138/\u2013139 bp (Horn et al., 2013; 23348503). TERT promoter mutations have been reported in 51_59% of gliomas (Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Killela et al., 2014; 24722048), most frequently in glioblastoma (GBM, 54_84%), gliosarcoma (81%), oligodendroglioma (78%), and historically in oligoastrocytomas (25_31%) but less frequently in lower grade astrocytomas (10_18%) and in only 1% of ependymomas (Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Liu et al., 2013; 23603989, Koelsche et al., 2013; 24154961, Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Killela et al., 2014; 24722048). In the context of IDH_mutated gliomas, TERT mutations are associated with improved OS (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021)(Arita et al., 2020; 33228806). TERT promoter mutation has been shown to be significantly associated with increased TERT gene expression in astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and GBM (Arita et al., 2013; 23764841). TERT promoter mutations significantly associate with poor prognosis in patients with GBM, although this correlation may be due to the association with primary GBM as opposed to IDH_positive secondary GBM (Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Reitman et al., 2013; 24217890, Arita et al., 2013; 23764841). In the context of IDH_wildtype glioma, TERT mutations are associated with reduced OS (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021). Therapeutic options for targeting tumors with TERT mutations are limited, although a variety of approaches have been investigated, including immunotherapies using TERT as a tumor_associated antigen and antisense oligonucleotide_ or peptide_based therapies. TERT peptide vaccines showed limited anticancer efficacy in clinical trials (Zanetti et al., 2017; 27245281); however, in one preclinical study, the combination of a TERT peptide vaccine and anti_CTLA_4 therapy suppressed tumor growth (Duperret at al., 2018; 29249395). A Phase 2 study of the TERT inhibitor imetelstat for patients with advanced non_small cell lung cancer reported no improvement in PFS or OS (Chiappori et al., 2015; 25467017). Co_occurring TERT mutation, IDH mutation, and 1p/19q co_deletion is indicative of oligodendroglioma (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021)(Weller et al., 2020; 33293629). TERT mutations are associated with 1p/19q co_deletion in oligodendrogliomas, and are highly recurrent in IDH/ATRX_wildtype glioblastoma (GBM) (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021)(Weller et al., 2020; 33293629).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "00", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "00"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Touat et al., 2020; 32322066, Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556, Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642). The median TMB of oligodendrogliomas is 2.7 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 8.4% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). For pediatric patients, high TMB has been reported in a subset of high_grade gliomas, frequently in association with mutations in mismatch repair or proofreading genes and in TP53, whereas BRAF alterations or other oncogene fusions were observed more frequently in brain tumors harboring low TMB (Patel et al., 2020; 32386112, Johnson et al., 2017; 28912153). Increased TMB has been reported to correlate with higher tumor grade in glioma (Draaisma et al., 2015; 26699864) and glioblastoma (GBM) tissue samples with biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD) (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570), as well as with shorter OS of patients with diffuse glioma (Wang et al., 2020; 32164609). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In glioma, a lack of association between TMB and clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors has been reported (Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Touat et al., 2020; 32322066). However, multiple case studies have reported that patients with ultramutated gliomas driven by POLE mutations have benefited from treatment with anti_PD_1 (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556) or anti_PD_L1 (Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642) therapies. Therefore, although increased TMB alone may not be a strong biomarker for PD_1 or PD_L1 inhibitors in this cancer type, these agents may have efficacy for patients with glioma harboring both high TMB and POLE mutation.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": {"Gene": "IDH2", "Alteration": "R172K", "Title": "A Study of HMPL_306 in Advanced Solid Tumors With IDH Mutations", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "IDH2, IDH1", "Locations": "Barcelona (Spain), Madrid (Spain), California, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Texas, Georgia", "NCTID": "NCT04762602", "Note": "IDH2 mutations may predict sensitivity to IDH2 inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}}, "References": {"Reference": [{"number": "0", "ReferenceId": "20513808", "FullCitation": "Reitman ZJ, et al.
