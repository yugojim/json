Loss of functional ATM promotes tumorigenesis (Cremona and Behrens, 2014; 23851492). Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. ATM alterations have been observed in various solid tumors, with mutations being more frequent than gene loss and often seen in small bowel (7_9%), endometrial (7%), non_melanoma skin (3_6%), bladder (5%), hepatobiliary (4_5%), colorectal (4_5%), and lung (3%) cancer (cBio_Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359, Nguyen et al., 2022; 35120664). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of ATM alterations in biliary tract carcinoma are limited (PubMed, Feb 2022). Loss of functional ATM results in a defective DNA damage response and homologous recombination_mediated DNA repair and may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Michels et al., 2014; 24037533). Clinical data in prostate cancer (Mateo et al., 2015; 26510020, Mateo et al., 2020; 31806540, de Bono et al., 2020; ASCO GU Abstract 119, Abida et al., 2020; 32086346), gastric cancer (Bang et al., 2015; 26282658), colorectal cancer (Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006), breast cancer (Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006), papillary renal cell carcinoma (Olson et al., 2016; 27079472), and cholangiocarcinoma (Piha_Paul et al., 2018; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract A096) indicate that loss or inactivation of ATM may confer sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Weston et al., 2010; 20739657, Williamson et al., 2010; 20124459, Gilardini et al., 2013; 24252502, Bryant and Helleday, 2006; 16556909, Ihnen et al., 2013; 23729402, Williamson et al., 2012; 22416035, Kubota et al., 2014; 24841718, Huehls et al., 2012; 22833573). In Phase 1 trials of ATR inhibitors, a heavily pretreated patient with colorectal cancer who achieved a CR to berzosertib (O Carrigan et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2504) and 4 out of 4 patients with diverse solid tumors who achieved PRs to BAY1895344 (Yap et al., 2020; 32988960) harbored ATM inactivation or protein loss; studies showing reduced cell viability and increased DNA damage in preclinical models of solid tumors (Menezes et al., 2015; 25232030, Vendetti et al., 2015; 26517239, Min et al., 2017; 28138034) and hematologic malignancies (Menezes et al., 2015; 25232030, Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132) also support the increased sensitivity of ATM_deficient cells to ATR inhibitors. Preclinical experiments also indicate that loss of ATM causes dependency on DNA_PKcs in cancer cells; DNA_PKcs inhibitors promoted apoptosis in ATM_deficient cells and were active in a lymphoma mouse model lacking ATM activity (Riabinska et al., 2013; 23761041). It is not known whether these therapeutic approaches would be relevant in the context of alterations that have not been fully characterized, as seen here. ATM mutation carriers have increased cancer risk, with female carriers displaying a 38% lifetime risk of breast cancer (van Os et al., 2016; 26662178). Biallelic mutations in ATM underlie the rare autosomal_recessive inherited disorder ataxia_telangiectasia (A_T), also referred to as genome instability or DNA damage response syndrome (Rothblum_Oviatt et al., 2016; 27884168). This disease is characterized by genomic instability, sensitivity to DNA_damaging agents, and increased risk of developing cancer (Shiloh and Ziv, 2013; 23847781, Rothblum_Oviatt et al., 2016; 27884168). The prevalence of A_T is estimated at 1:40,000 to 1:100,000 worldwide (Rothblum_Oviatt et al., 2016; 27884168). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of ATM is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors may detect nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

Talazoparib has been studied primarily in the context of BRCA_mutated, HER2_negative breast cancer, where patients achieved significantly longer median PFS (8.6 vs. 5.6 months, HR=0.54), a higher ORR (62.6% vs. 27.2%), and improved quality of life on talazoparib compared with standard chemotherapy in a Phase 3 study (Litton et al., 2018; 30110579, Ettl et al., 2018; 30124753).

Rucaparib has primarily been evaluated in the context of ovarian carcinoma, breast carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, and melanoma. In a Phase 2 study of rucaparib for recurrent, platinum_sensitive ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma, median PFS was significantly longer in patients with BRCA1/2 mutations (12.8 months) or high loss of heterozygosity (LOH; 5.7 months) compared to patients with low LOH (5.2 months). Objective responses were observed for 80% (32/40) of patients with BRCA1/2 mutations, for 29% (24/82) with high LOH, and for 10% (7/10) with low LOH (Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). In heavily pretreated patients with a germline BRCA1/2 mutation who had received 2_4 prior chemotherapy treatments and had a progression free interval of greater than 6 months, 65% (17/26) of patients achieved an objective response with rucaparib treatment (Shapira_Frommer et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5513). In a Phase 2 study evaluating rucaparib for patients with advanced breast or ovarian cancer and germline BRCA1/2 mutations, disease control was observed in 92% (12/13) of patients with ovarian cancer treated with oral rucaparib dosed continuously, but no objective responses were reported in breast cancer patients (n=23). However, 39% (9/23) of evaluable patients with breast cancer achieved SD lasting 12 weeks or more (Drew et al., 2016; 27002934). In a Phase 1 study of rucaparib treatment in patients with solid tumors, 3/4 patients with ovarian cancer and 1/1 patient with breast cancer given the recommended Phase 2 dose reported objective responses; all responders harbored BRCA1/2 mutations (Kristeleit et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 2573).

Published data investigating the prognostic implications of bTMB levels in biliary tract cancer are limited (PubMed, Jul 2021). Although cases with hypermutated biliary tract cancer were enriched in a subgroup with poor prognosis in 1 study (Nakamura et al., 2015; 26258846), TMB_high (\u226510 mut/Mb) status in biliary adenocarcinoma not treated with immunotherapy was not significantly associated with OS in another study, in which patients with TMB_high tumors experienced numerically longer OS compared with patients with TMB_low tumors (11.5 vs. 8.4 months, adjusted HR=0.65) (Shao et al., 2020; 33119110). On the basis of clinical evidence in NSCLC and HSNCC, increased bTMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511) and anti_PD_1 (Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074) therapies. In NSCLC, multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 to 16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). In HNSCC, a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "DNMT3A", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "splice site 2479_2delA", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "splice site 2479_2delA"}}, "Interpretation": "The DNMT3A gene encodes the protein DNA methyltransferase 3A, an enzyme that is involved in the methylation of newly synthesized DNA, a function critical for gene regulation (Trowbridge and Orkin, 2012; 22200773, Ch\u00e9din, 2011; 21507354). The role of DNMT3A in cancer is uncertain, as some reports describe increased expression and contribution to tumor growth, whereas others propose a role for DNMT3A as a tumor suppressor (Yang et al., 2011; 21887466, Vallb\u00f6hmer et al., 2006; 16870044, Daskalos et al., 2011; 21351083, Fabbri et al., 2007; 17890317, Gao et al., 2011; 22011581, Kim et al., 2013; 23031157). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt DNMT3A function or expression (Chen et al., 2005; 15861382, Guo et al., 2015; 25383530, Sandoval et al., 2019; 30705090, Zhang et al., 2018; 29414941). DNMT3A alterations have been reported at relatively low frequencies in solid tumors and are more prevalent in hematological malignancies (cBioPortal, Feb 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of DNMT3A alterations in solid tumors are limited (PubMed, Feb 2022). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in DNMT3A in solid tumors. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI_H is infrequent in cholangiocarcinoma, reported in 1% of samples (Javle et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 4087). A non_zero level of MSI has been reported in 18_49% of cholangiocarcinoma cases (Momoi et al., 2001; 11580146, Limpaiboon et al., 2002; 12175538, Liu et al., 2002; 12402306, Liengswangwong et al., 2003; 14506736), although the studies did not specify what fraction of cases were MSI_H. A higher frequency of MSI (63%) was reported in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma associated with exposure to Thorotrast (Liu et al., 2002; 12402306). One study reported that MSI is associated with poor prognosis in liver fluke_related cholangiocarcinoma (Limpaiboon et al., 2002; 12175538). On the basis of prospective clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD_1_targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143) and PD_L1_targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92).

TNFAIP3 is frequently deleted or mutated in lymphoma, where it functions as a tumor suppressor (Honma et al., 2009; 19608751), but its expression and function are context dependent in solid tumors (Wang et al., 2016; 26909601, Couch et al., 2016; 27072986, Wang et al., 2015; 26485275, Harhaj and Dixit, 2011; 21119682, Salim et al., 2013; 23929716), leukemia (Saitoh et al., 2016; 26437781, Johansson et al., 2016; 26199174, Chen et al., 2015; 26159495), and multiple myeloma (Broyl et al., 2010; 20574050, Troppan et al., 2015; 25856582). TNFAIP3 mutations that disrupt the A20p37 chain (amino acids 371\u2013790), which mediates ubiquitin ligase activity and interaction with the cIAP1/TRAF2 complex (Wertz et al., 2004; 15258597, Yamaguchi et al., 2013; 24008839), are predicted to be inactivating. In T_cells, cleavage of A20 codon R439 by MALT1 has been shown to upregulate NFkB signaling; R439A has been shown to block MALT1_mediated NF_kB activation (Coornaert et al., 2008; 18223652); however, the function of R439 mutations outside of the context of T_cell lymphoma has not been reported. In the COSMIC dataset, TNFAIP3 mutations have been reported in 3.5% of prostate, 3.1% of endometrial, 2.8% of skin, 2.7% of gastric, and 2.4% of large intestine cancers (Jan 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Overexpression of TNFAIP3 has been associated with aggressive high_grade ER_/PR_negative breast tumors (Vendrell et al., 2007; 17297453), resistance to TNF_alpha and TRAIL_induced apoptosis in glioblastoma (Hjelmeland et al., 2010; 20186265, Bellail et al., 2012; 22585859) and to chemotherapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Chen et al., 2015; 26159495), and poor prognosis in adrenocortical carcinoma (Hantel et al., 2016; 26768118). Loss of heterozygosity in the genomic region including TNFAIP3 has been found in 16.8% (25/149) of colorectal adenocarcinomas, and significantly decreased TNFAIP3 mRNA expression has been observed in colorectal cancer (CRC) tumors compared with adjacent non_neoplastic mucosa (Ungerb\u00e4ck et al., 2012; 22843550). Reduced A20 expression has been suggested as a marker of poor prognosis in CRC (Bavi et al., 2011; 22704353). There are no therapies that address the loss of TNFAIP3. A20 has multiple functions and is subject to a wide range of genomic lesions, thereby making it challenging to develop a unified therapeutic approach. Potential avenues targeting dysregulation of ubiquitination pathways include anti_CD20 therapies, such as rituximab, and proteasome inhibitors, such as bortezomib (Hymowitz and Wertz, 2010; 20383180). RNAi_mediated downregulation of TNFAIP3 has been reported to sensitize multiple myeloma cells to bortezomib (Zhu et al., 2011; 21289309).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Fraction", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction Not Detected", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction Not Detected"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor fraction provides an estimate of the percentage of ctDNA present in a cell_free DNA (cfDNA) sample. The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with elevated tumor fraction values have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus high sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at low risk of false negative results. However, if elevated tumor fraction is not detected, it does not exclude the presence of disease burden or compromise the confidence of reported alterations. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels.
