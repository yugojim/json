In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). EGFR L858 is located in the kinase domain and is encoded by exon 21. EGFR L858R has been characterized as activating (Lynch et al., 2004; 15118073, Paez et al., 2004; 15118125, Pao et al., 2004; 15329413) and patients with the L858R mutation have been shown to be sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as erlotinib, gefitinib (Lynch et al., 2004; 15118073, Paez et al., 2004; 15118125, Pao et al., 2004; 15329413), and afatinib (Yang et al., 2015; 25589191). EGFR mutation has been reported in 12_36% of lung adenocarcinomas (Vallee et al., 2013; 23934203, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552) and in 4% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745). EGFR protein expression/overexpression has been reported in up to 70% of NSCLC cases (Watzka et al., 2010; 20353893, Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Grob et al., 2013; 23238037, Park et al., 2012; 22207554, Dobashi et al., 2011; 21040950, Ludovini et al., 2013; 23314677). In addition, expression of EGFR protein has been shown to be higher in lung squamous cell carcinoma samples as compared to lung adenocarcinoma (Skrzypski et al., 2013; 23870818, Kim et al., 2012; 22419022). In patients with lung adenocarcinoma, EGFR mutation was a predictor of poor overall survival (Lee et al., 2013; 23525704, Oakley and Chiosea, 2011; 21587084). However, EGFR mutations have been reported to predict improved survival in patients with resected Stage 1_3 lung adenocarcinoma (Marks et al., 2008; 18303429) or resected Stage 1 NSCLC (Izar et al., 2013; 23932319). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EGFR activating mutations may predict sensitivity to EGFR\u2013TKIs, including erlotinib (Rosell et al., 2011; 22285168), gefitinib (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064, Hayashi et al., 2020; 32673682, Cao et al., 2018; 29780256, Yang et al., 2011; 21422421), afatinib (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960, Bao_Dong Qin et al., 2018; 30127622, Frega et al., 2016; 27131295, Long et al., 2020; 33116645), dacomitinib (Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), and osimertinib (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549, Bao_Dong Qin et al., 2018; 30127622); however, the data for patients with other tumor types are limited (Hong et al., 2020; 32749686, Kim et al., 2015; 26462025, Kim et al., 2015; 25424851, Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840, Cavalieri et al., 2018; 29734047, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Audet et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 6041). The Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study of amivantamab monotherapy or in combination with lazertinib for the treatment of EGFR_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has produced encouraging preliminary results for treatment_naive patients and patients who relapsed after treatment with osimertinib with and without chemotherapy, including osimertinib_relapsed patients with biomarkers indicating EGFR/MET_based osimertinib resistance (Leighl et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 1192MO, Cho et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 1258O, Bauml et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9006, Shu et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 1193MO). In a Phase 1 trial, the HER3_targeted antibody patritumab deruxtecan elicited an ORR of 39% (22/57, 1 CR) and a median PFS of 8.2 months for patients with non_small cell lung cancer previously treated with an EGFR TKI, many of whom displayed TKI resistance alterations (Janne et al., 2022; 34548309). A Phase 1 trial evaluating the EGFR inhibitor AZD3759 reported a reduction in the volume of brain metastases in 40% (8/20) of patients with previously treated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring either the EGFR L858R alteration or EGFR exon 19 deletion, including 3 confirmed PRs and 3 unconfirmed PRs (Ahn et al., 2017; 29056570, Yang et al., 2016; 27928026). In a Phase 1/2 trial for advanced NSCLC, the brain_penetrant third_generation EGFR TKI lazertinib enabled ORRs of 54% (69/127) for all evaluable patients and 44% (8/18, intracranial) for patients with brain metastases (Ahn et al., 2019; 31587882). A Phase 1 trial evaluating the irreversible pan_HER inhibitor FCN_411 for NSCLC patients who had EGFR mutations and experienced disease progression on standard treatments reported an ORR of 15% with 10/67 patients achieving PR, and a DCR of 73% with 39 additional patients achieving SD (Lin et al., 2022; 35248866). OR was observed in a numerically higher proportion of patients with the EGFR T790M mutation than those without this mutation (Lin et al., 2022; 35248866). Patients with EGFR_mutated non_squamous metastatic non_small cell lung cancer previously treated with EGFR TKI have benefited from immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with anti_angiogenic and chemotherapy, particularly atezolizumab plus bevacizumab plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (OS HR 0.61 compared with bevacizumab/chemotherapy) (Reck et al., 2019; 30922878, Socinski et al., 2021; 34311108, Socinski et al., 2018; 29863955) or sintilimab plus bevacizumab biosimilar plus cisplatin and pemetrexed (PFS HR 0.46 compared with chemotherapy alone) (Lu et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract VP9_2021). In retrospective analyses, patients with EGFR_mutated non_small cell lung cancer that transformed to small cell lung cancer demonstrated response rates of 50% to taxane and 54% (with a median PFS of 3.4 months) to platinum_etoposide (Dingemans et al., 2021; 33864941, Marcoux et al., 2019; 30550363).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

This study and meta_analyses attribute the lack of OS benefit to the effectiveness of post_progression salvage therapy in the control arm (Lee et al., 2017; 28376144). A Phase 3 study reported similar efficacy of erlotinib and gefitinib for patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC (Yang et al., 2017; 28103612). Patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC have experienced PFS benefit with the addition of bevacizumab to erlotinib in the first_line setting in Phase 3 trials including the ARTEMIS_CTONG1509 trial for Chinese patients (17.9 vs. 11.2 months, HR=0.55)(Zhou et al., 2021; 34388377), the NEJ026 trial for Japanese patients (16.9 vs. 13.3 months, HR=0.605)(Kawashima et al., 2022; 34454653, Saito et al., 2019; 30975627), and the international BEVERLY trial (15.4 vs. 9.7 months, HR=0.60)(Piccirillo et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 12070); OS benefit has not been observed across these studies. In the maintenance setting, Phase 3 trials have reported significantly improved PFS with maintenance erlotinib following first_line platinum_based chemotherapy, with the largest benefit for patients with EGFR mutations (Cappuzzo et al., 2010; 20493771, Faehling et al., 2018; 29687154). In the neoadjuvant setting, a Phase 2 trial reported a numerically improved ORR and significantly longer PFS with erlotinib compared with chemotherapy for patients with EGFR_mutated advanced NSCLC (Zhong et al., 2019; 31194613). In the placebo_controlled Phase 3 RELAY trial, the addition of ramucirumab to erlotinib improved PFS for previously untreated patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR L858R or exon 19 deletion (19.4 vs. 12.4 months, HR=0.59)(Nakagawa et al., 2019; 31591063). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Osimertinib", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Osimertinib is an irreversible EGFR TKI that is selective for EGFR TKI_sensitizing mutations and the EGFR T790M mutation.

Please see the drug label for full prescribing information. </p> <p><b>Gene Association:</b> EGFR activating mutations may indicate sensitivity to afatinib or dacomitinib for patients with non_small cell lung cancer (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960, Wu et al., 2014; 24439929, Passaro et al., 2019; ELCC Abstract 115O, Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), whereas data for patients with other tumor types are limited (Hong et al., 2020; 32749686, Kim et al., 2015; 26462025, Kim et al., 2015; 25424851, Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840, Cavalieri et al., 2018; 29734047, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Audet et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 6041). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> Afatinib has shown significant clinical activity for patients with NSCLC and the EGFR common sensitizing mutations L858R or exon 19 deletions, based on extensive clinical evidence (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960, Wu et al., 2014; 24439929, Lau et al., 2019; 31178389, Paz_Ares et al., 2017; 28426106, Thongprasert et al., 2019; 31807143, Januszewski et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.13_17). Two randomized Phase 3 trials reported significantly improved median PFS from afatinib compared with chemotherapy for patients with EGFR common sensitizing mutations (LUX_Lung 3, 13.6 vs. 6.9 months, HR 0.47, p<0.001; LUX_Lung 6, 11.0 vs. 5.6 months, HR 0.28, p<0.0001) (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960, Wu et al., 2014; 24439929). However, while afatinib significantly increased OS relative to chemotherapy for patients with EGFR exon 19 alterations in these two trials (LUX_Lung 3, 33.3 vs. 21.1 months, HR=0.54; LUX_Lung 6, 31.4 vs. 18.4 months, HR=0.64), no significant OS differences were observed in treatment for patients with L858R mutation (Yang et al., 2015; 25589191). A similar alteration_specific difference was observed for EGFR_mutated treatment_naive NSCLC in a retrospective analysis, which reported numerically longer median OS from second_ versus first_generation EGFR TKIs (48.8 vs. 26.4 months, HR=0.59) for patients with exon 19 deletions, but no substantial difference for patients with L858R (25.4 vs. 20.6 months, HR=0.90) (Lau et al., 2019; 31178389). A Phase 2b study of first_line afatinib compared with gefitinib, also for NSCLC with exon 19 deletions or L858R, reported similar median OS for the two therapies (27.9 vs. 24.5 months, HR=0.86) but significantly longer time_to_treatment_failure (13.7 vs. 11.5 months, HR=0.75) and higher ORR (73% vs. 56%, p=0.0018) with afatinib (Paz_Ares et al., 2017; 28426106). Patients with metastatic NSCLC and common EGFR mutations who progressed on prior chemotherapy experienced an ORR of 50.0% (30/60) from afatinib in a Phase 4 trial (Thongprasert et al., 2019; 31807143). As first_line therapy for NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletions or L858R, prospective or randomized Phase 2 trials have reported a median PFS of 10.2 months and OS of 24.8 months for patients unfit for chemotherapy (Januszewski et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.13_17) and an ORR of 72.5% (n=40, 1 CR), DCR of 100% (40/40), and median PFS and OS of 15.2 and 30.0 months, respectively, for elderly patients \u226570 years old (Suzuki et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_92). A retrospective study of afatinib administered to Asian patients with NSCLC, 99% of whom were previously treated with erlotinib and/or gefitinib, reported an ORR of 27.4% (63/230) for patients with common sensitizing EGFR mutations and an ORR of 24.4% (105/431) for the entire cohort (Chang et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_11). In a case report, a patient with NSCLC with exon 19 deletion and leptomeningeal metastases experienced an ongoing 16_month PR from afatinib in extracranial, brain, and leptomeningeal lesions (Llin\u00e1s_Quintero et al., 2019; 31637072). For patients with erlotinib_ or gefitinib_resistant NSCLC and EGFR mutations, Phase 2/3 studies of afatinib treatment have generally reported ORRs of only 7 to 9% (Miller et al., 2012; 22452896, Chen et al., 2013; 23664448, Katakami et al., 2013; 23816963, Landi et al., 2014; 25242668, De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2015; 25682316, Yang et al., 2015; 26051236); however, DCRs of more than 50% have been observed (De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2015; 25682316). In a Phase 1b or observational study, patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC who progressed on afatinib experienced further clinical benefit from subsequent treatment with afatinib and cetuximab (Horn et al., 2017; 29110849) or osimertinib (Yamamoto et al., 2020; 31863283), respectively. Extensive clinical data have demonstrated that afatinib is effective for patients with EGFR_mutated advanced NSCLC, including exon 19 deletions and L858 mutations, as well as uncommon sensitizing mutations in exons 18 or 20 (Januszewski et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.13_17, Chang et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_11, Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960, Wu et al., 2014; 24439929, Yang et al., 2015; 25589191, Soria et al., 2015; 26156651, Paz_Ares et al., 2017; 28426106). Afatinib has also shown activity for patients with advanced NSCLC and ERBB2 mutations, most of which were exon 20 insertions (Dziadziuszko et al., 2019; 30825613, Lai et al., 2019; 30685684, Greulich et al., 2012; 22908275, Gow et al., 2015; 26134234, Mazi\u00e8res et al., 2016; 26598547, Mazi\u00e8res et al., 2013; 23610105, De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2015; 25682316, De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2012; 22325357, Li et al., 2015; 26559459, Costa et al., 2016; 26964772, Yuan et al., 2020; 32477948, Fang et al., 2019; 31748336). The randomized Phase 3 LUX_Lung 8 trial comparing afatinib with erlotinib as second_line therapy for advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) reported significantly longer median OS (7.9 vs. 6.8 months, HR=0.81), significantly longer median PFS (2.6 vs. 1.9 months, HR=0.81), and higher DCR (51% vs. 40%, p=0.002) for patients treated with afatinib (Soria et al., 2015; 26156651). For patients who progressed on afatinib monotherapy, additional clinical benefit has been reported from afatinib combined with paclitaxel (Schuler et al., 2016; 26646759). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT02609776", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03114319", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04077463", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02099058", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04721015", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03720873", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04619004", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04058704", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05015608", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05007938", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "RAD54L", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "C391fs*1", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "C391fs*1"}}, "Interpretation": "RAD54L encodes a member of the SNF2/SWI2 superfamily and forms part of the RAD52 complex involved in recombination and DNA repair in response to ionizing radiation (Kanaar et al., 1996; 8805304, Sigurdsson et al., 2002; 12205100, Swagemakers et al., 1998; 9774452, van Veelen et al., 2005; 15914205). Alterations leading to disruption of critical domains with RAD54L are predicted to enhance genomic instability (Smirnova et al., 2004; 15056673). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt RAD54L function or expression (Smirnova et al., 2004; 15056673, Matsuda et al., 1999; 10362365, Golub et al., 1997; 9321665, Spies et al., 2016; 27264870, Goyal et al., 2018; 29295984, Burgess et al. 2013; 24376557, Lengert et al., 2019; 30961891). RAD54L alterations are rare in cancer (cBio_Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at chromosomal region 1p32_34, in which RAD54L resides, has been reported as a frequent event in breast cancer (Rasio et al., 1997; 9192813), oligodendroglioma (Bello et al., 2000; 10640146), nontypical meningioma (Kim et al., 2009; 19347254, Leuraud et al., 2000; 11263500, Lopez_Gines et al., 2004; 14734222, Mendiola et al., 1999; 10326867), and parathyroid adenoma (Carling et al., 1999; 10449612), but it is not clear whether RAD54L loss of function is pathogenic in these cases. Increased RAD54L expression was reported in NSCLC samples in response to increased mutation rate (V\u00e4lk et al., 2010; 21412013) and also in castration_resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells (Li et al., 2017; 28536297). RAD54L polymorphisms have been associated with increased risk of developing meningioma (Leone et al., 2003; 12614485), glioma (Zhang et al., 2016; 26514363), and decreased overall survival (P<0.004) in patients with potentially resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Li et al., 2006; 16520463). Germline mutations of RAD54L has been associated with increased risk of gastric cancer (Li et al., 2013; 23504502) but not lymphoid malignancies (Shinozuka et al., 2015; 26743341). There are no therapies available that directly target RAD54L. Limited clinical evidence in ovarian cancer (O Malley et al., 2017; AACR Abstract LB_A12, Swisher et al., 2017; 27908594) and prostate cancer (de Bono et al., 2020; 32343890) indicates that RAD54L inactivation may confer sensitivity to PARP inhibitors.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "RAD54L inactivation may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04380636", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04624204", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04644068", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04123366", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03742895", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02264678", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04939662", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04659785", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05035745", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03772561", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "ASXL1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "L386*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "L386*"}}, "Interpretation": "ASXL1 regulates epigenetic marks and transcription through interaction with polycomb complex proteins and various transcription activators and repressors (Scheuermann et al., 2010; 20436459, Cho et al., 2006; 16606617, Park et al., 2011; 21047783).

ASXL1 alterations occur infrequently across various solid tumor types (cBio_Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359) and are not known to act as drivers in any specific solid cancer type (Bailey et al., 2018; 29625053). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of ASXL1 alterations in solid tumors are limited (PubMed, May 2022). In the context of clonal hematopoiesis, ASXL1 mutations are significantly enriched in current or former smokers (Bolton et al., 2020; 33106634). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in ASXL1. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

High bTMB levels were not detected in this sample. It is unclear whether the bTMB levels in this sample would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Depending on the clinical context, TMB testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. NSCLC harbors a median bTMB of 16.8 Muts/Mb (range 1.9_52.5 Muts/Mb)(Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950). Retrospective analysis of the Phase 3 OAK and Phase 2 POPLAR trials for patients with advanced or metastatic non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) reported that bTMB \u22657 Muts/Mb was associated with shorter PFS (2.8 vs. 4.2 months) and OS (7.4 vs. 11.9 months) compared with bTMB <7 Muts/Mb for patients treated with docetaxel (Nie et al., 2020; 32380463). In one study of advanced NSCLC in China, bTMB \u22656 Muts/Mb was associated with decreased PFS (10 vs. 18 months) and OS (11 vs. 25 months) compared with bTMB <6 Muts/Mb for patients treated with platinum_based chemotherapy (Ma et al., 2021; 34055609). A meta_analysis of 19 studies of immune checkpoint inhibitor_treated NSCLC (n = 2,315 patients) demonstrated that high TMB predicted a significantly longer OS than low TMB (HR = 0.70), and within the high TMB group, immunotherapy was associated with an improved PFS (HR = 0.62, P<0.001), OS (HR = 0.67, P<0.001) and a higher response rate (OR = 2.35, P<0.001) compared to chemotherapy (Meng et al., 2022; 35113949). In contrast, a large study of Chinese patients with untreated lung adenocarcinoma reported a shorter median OS for tumors with a higher number of mutations in a limited gene set compared with a lower mutation number (48.4 vs. 61.0 months)(Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843). Another study of patients with NSCLC treated with EGFR inhibitors or platinum doublet chemotherapy found elevated TMB to be correlated with poorer prognosis, as well as finding lower TMB in combination with PD_L1 negative status to be significantly associated with longer median survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). However, no significant prognostic association of TMB and/or PD_L1 status with survival has been reported in patients with lung SCC (Yu et al., 2019; 30253973, Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB) may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716), anti_PD_1 (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716), and anti_PD_1/CTLA4 therapies (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P). A Phase 2 multi_solid_tumor trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022). In non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single_agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 Muts/Mb_16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Cannot Be Determined", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Cannot Be Determined"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI_H is generally infrequent in NSCLC, reported in fewer than 1% of samples across several large studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197, Ninomiya et al., 2006; 16641899, Vanderwalde et al., 2018; 29436178, Zang et al., 2019; 31270941, Dudley et al., 2016; 26880610, Takamochi et al., 2017; 28676214, Schrock et al., 2017; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2016.11.487), whereas data on the reported incidence of MSI_H in SCLC has been limited and conflicting (Pylkkanen et al., 1997; 9329646, Gonzalez et al., 2000; 11061602, Chen et al., 1996; 8782463, Merlo et al., 1994; 8174113). One study reported MSI_H in lung adenocarcinoma patients with smoking history, and 3 of 4 MSI_H patients examined also had metachronous carcinomas in other organs, although this has not been investigated in large scale studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of MSI in NSCLC are limited (PubMed, Oct 2021). On the basis of prospective clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD_1_targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143) and PD_L1_targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92).

Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TET2 function or expression (Iyer et al., 2009; 19411852, Ko et al., 2010; 21057493, Yang et al., 2013; 22391558, Hu et al., 2013; 24315485, Wang et al., 2015; 25601757). TET2 alterations have been reported at relatively low frequencies in solid tumors and are more prevalent in hematological malignancies (cBioPortal, Jan 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of TET2 alterations in solid tumors are limited (PubMed, Jan 2022). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in TET2 in solid tumors. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "A138V", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "A138V"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 is one of the most commonly mutated genes in lung cancer; mutations have been reported in 43_80% of non_small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745, Mogi and Kuwano, 2011; 21331359, Tekpli et al., 2013; 23011884, Vignot et al., 2013; 23630207, Maeng et al., 2013; 24222160, Cortot et al., 2014; 24169260, Itakura et al., 2013; 23922113), including 42_52% of lung adenocarcinomas and 58_83% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (cBioPortal, COSMIC, Feb 2022)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, cBio_Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745, Kim et al., 2014; 24323028). TP53 homozygous deletion has been observed in 1.4% of lung adenocarcinoma and <1% of lung squamous cell carcinoma cases (cBioPortal, Feb 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). In one study of 55 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, TP53 alterations correlated with immunogenic features including PD_L1 expression, tumor mutation burden and neoantigen presentation; likely as a consequence of this association TP53 mutations correlated with improved clinical outcomes to PD_1 inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab in this study (Dong et al., 2016; 28039262). Mutations in TP53 have been associated with lymph node metastasis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (Seo et al., 2012; 22975805). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may also be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as APR_246 (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571, Lehmann et al., 2012; 22965953, Mohell et al., 2015; 26086967, Franssonet al., 2016; 27179933). In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, APR_246 combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with elevated tumor fraction values have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus high sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at low risk of false negative results. However, if elevated tumor fraction is not detected, it does not exclude the presence of disease burden or compromise the confidence of reported alterations. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels. In the research setting, changes in tumor fraction estimates have been associated with treatment duration and clinical response and may be a useful indicator for future cancer management (Bronkhorst et al., 2019; 30923679, Raja et al., 2018; 30093454, Hrebien et al., 2019; 30860573, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5039, Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Goodall et al., 2017; 28450425, Goldberg et al., 2018; 29330207).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "EGFR", "Alteration": "L858R", "Title": "A Dose Escalation Study of JNJ_61186372 in Participants With Advanced Non_Small Cell Lung Cancer", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "EGFR, MET", "Locations": "Taipei (Taiwan), Taipei City (Taiwan), Taichung (Taiwan), Kaohsiung (Taiwan), Hangzhou (China), Nanchang (China), Nanjing (China), Hefei (China), Guangzhou (China), Changsha (China)", "NCTID": "NCT02609776", "Note": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.
