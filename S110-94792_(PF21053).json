In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations, such as seen here, have been shown to activate the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR and to confer sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib, gefitinib (Lynch et al., 2004; 15118073, Paez et al., 2004; 15118125, Pao et al., 2004; 15329413), afatinib (Yang et al., 2015; 25589191), osimertinib (Soria et al., 2018; 29151359), and dacomitinib (Wu et al., 2017; 28958502, Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), although limited preclinical data suggest reduced sensitivity to lapatinib (Gilmer et al., 2008; 18199554, Foster et al., 2016; 26996308). EGFR mutation has been reported in 12_36% of lung adenocarcinomas (Vallee et al., 2013; 23934203, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552) and in 4% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745). EGFR protein expression/overexpression has been reported in up to 70% of NSCLC cases (Watzka et al., 2010; 20353893, Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Grob et al., 2013; 23238037, Park et al., 2012; 22207554, Dobashi et al., 2011; 21040950, Ludovini et al., 2013; 23314677). In addition, expression of EGFR protein has been shown to be higher in lung squamous cell carcinoma samples as compared to lung adenocarcinoma (Skrzypski et al., 2013; 23870818, Kim et al., 2012; 22419022). In patients with lung adenocarcinoma, EGFR mutation was a predictor of poor overall survival (Lee et al., 2013; 23525704, Oakley and Chiosea, 2011; 21587084). However, EGFR mutations have been reported to predict improved survival in patients with resected Stage 1_3 lung adenocarcinoma (Marks et al., 2008; 18303429) or resected Stage 1 NSCLC (Izar et al., 2013; 23932319). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer, EGFR activating mutations may predict sensitivity to EGFR TKIs, including erlotinib (Rosell et al., 2011; 22285168), gefitinib (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064), afatinib (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960), dacomitinib (Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), and osimertinib (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549); however, the data for patients with other tumor types are limited (Hong et al., 2020; 32749686, Kim et al., 2015; 26462025, Kim et al., 2015; 25424851, Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840, Cavalieri et al., 2018; 29734047, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Audet et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 6041). The Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study of amivantamab monotherapy or in combination with lazertinib for the treatment of EGFR_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has produced encouraging preliminary results for treatment_naive patients and patients who relapsed after treatment with osimertinib with and without chemotherapy, including osimertinib_relapsed patients with biomarkers indicating EGFR/MET_based osimertinib resistance (Leighl et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 1192MO, Cho et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 1258O, Bauml et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9006, Shu et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 1193MO). In a Phase 1 trial, the HER3_targeted antibody patritumab deruxtecan elicited an ORR of 39% (22/57, 1 CR) and a median PFS of 8.2 months for patients with non_small cell lung cancer previously treated with an EGFR TKI, many of whom displayed TKI resistance alterations (Janne et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9007). A Phase 1 trial evaluating the EGFR inhibitor AZD3759 reported a reduction in the volume of brain metastases in 40% (8/20) of patients with previously treated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring either the EGFR L858R alteration or EGFR exon 19 deletion, including 3 confirmed PRs and 3 unconfirmed PRs (Ahn et al., 2017; 29056570, Yang et al., 2016; 27928026). In a Phase 1/2 trial for advanced NSCLC, the brain_penetrant third_generation EGFR TKI lazertinib enabled ORRs of 54% (69/127) for all evaluable patients and 44% (8/18, intracranial) for patients with brain metastases (Ahn et al., 2019; 31587882). The Phase 3 IMpower150 study showed that the addition of atezolizumab to bevacizumab plus chemotherapy treatment also had clinical efficacy for patients with EGFR_mutated or ALK_rearranged metastatic NSCLC (Socinski et al., 2018; 29863955); therefore, the patient\u2019s clinical context should be considered.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

A pooled subgroup analysis of patients with NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations reported improved clinical efficacy with dacomitinib treatment compared with erlotinib (median PFS, 14.6 vs, 9.6 months, HR=0.717; median OS, 26.6 vs, 23.2 months, HR=0.737)(Ramalingam et al., 2016; 26768165). Reduced efficacy of dacomitinib treatment in patients with NSCLC harboring the EGFR T790M mutation has been reported in multiple studies (Yu et al., 2017; 29191595, Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009, Janne et al., 2011; 21220471). A Phase 1 trial of combination dacomitinib and a MEK1/2 inhibitor for patients with KRAS_mutated CRC, NSCLC, or pancreatic cancer reported 20/36 SDs and 16 PDs, however toxicity from this combination prevented long_term treatment in this patient population (van Geel et al., 2020; 32147669). A Phase 2 study of dacomitinib in patients with NSCLC who had been previously treated with chemotherapy or erlotinib and were not selected for EGFR mutations reported an ORR of 4.5% (3/66) (Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009).

Two randomized Phase 3 trials reported significantly improved median PFS from afatinib compared with chemotherapy for patients with EGFR common sensitizing mutations (LUX_Lung 3, 13.6 vs. 6.9 months, HR 0.47, p<0.001; LUX_Lung 6, 11.0 vs. 5.6 months, HR 0.28, p<0.0001) (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960, Wu et al., 2014; 24439929). However, while afatinib significantly increased OS relative to chemotherapy for patients with EGFR exon 19 alterations in these two trials (LUX_Lung 3, 33.3 vs. 21.1 months, HR=0.54; LUX_Lung 6, 31.4 vs. 18.4 months, HR=0.64), no significant OS differences were observed in treatment for patients with L858R mutation (Yang et al., 2015; 25589191). A similar alteration_specific difference was observed for EGFR_mutated treatment_naive NSCLC in a retrospective analysis, which reported numerically longer median OS from second_ versus first_generation EGFR TKIs (48.8 vs. 26.4 months, HR=0.59) for patients with exon 19 deletions, but no substantial difference for patients with L858R (25.4 vs. 20.6 months, HR=0.90) (Lau et al., 2019; 31178389). A Phase 2b study of first_line afatinib compared with gefitinib, also for NSCLC with exon 19 deletions or L858R, reported similar median OS for the two therapies (27.9 vs. 24.5 months, HR=0.86) but significantly longer time_to_treatment_failure (13.7 vs. 11.5 months, HR=0.75) and higher ORR (73% vs. 56%, p=0.0018) with afatinib (Paz_Ares et al., 2017; 28426106). Patients with metastatic NSCLC and common EGFR mutations who progressed on prior chemotherapy experienced an ORR of 50.0% (30/60) from afatinib in a Phase 4 trial (Thongprasert et al., 2019; 31807143). As first_line therapy for NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletions or L858R, prospective or randomized Phase 2 trials have reported a median PFS of 10.2 months and OS of 24.8 months for patients unfit for chemotherapy (Januszewski et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.13_17) and an ORR of 72.5% (n=40, 1 CR), DCR of 100% (40/40), and median PFS and OS of 15.2 and 30.0 months, respectively, for elderly patients \u226570 years old (Suzuki et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_92). A retrospective study of afatinib administered to Asian patients with NSCLC, 99% of whom were previously treated with erlotinib and/or gefitinib, reported an ORR of 27.4% (63/230) for patients with common sensitizing EGFR mutations and an ORR of 24.4% (105/431) for the entire cohort (Chang et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_11). In a case report, a patient with NSCLC with exon 19 deletion and leptomeningeal metastases experienced an ongoing 16_month PR from afatinib in extracranial, brain, and leptomeningeal lesions (Llin\u00e1s_Quintero et al., 2019; 31637072). For patients with erlotinib_ or gefitinib_resistant NSCLC and EGFR mutations, Phase 2/3 studies of afatinib treatment have generally reported ORRs of only 7 to 9% (Miller et al., 2012; 22452896, Chen et al., 2013; 23664448, Katakami et al., 2013; 23816963, Landi et al., 2014; 25242668, De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2015; 25682316, Yang et al., 2015; 26051236); however, DCRs of more than 50% have been observed (De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2015; 25682316). In a Phase 1b or observational study, patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC who progressed on afatinib experienced further clinical benefit from subsequent treatment with afatinib and cetuximab (Horn et al., 2017; 29110849) or osimertinib (Yamamoto et al., 2020; 31863283), respectively.

Gefitinib achieved an ORR of 69.8% and an OS of 19.2 months as first_line treatment for Caucasian patients with non_small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and EGFR sensitizing mutations (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064). In the retrospective analysis of a Phase 3 study for East Asian patients, gefitinib was reported to have a longer PFS for patients with EGFR mutation_positive NSCLC compared with carboplatin/paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy (Fukuoka et al., 2011; 21670455, Mok et al., 2009; 19692680). Two Phase 3 trials of gefitinib plus pemetrexed and carboplatin compared with gefitinib alone for patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR activating mutations reported significantly higher ORRs (75.3% and 84% vs. 62.5% and 67%), longer median PFSs (16 and 20.9 months vs. 8 and 11.9 months), and longer median OSs (50.9 months and not reached vs. 17 and 38.8 months) with combination treatment; however, combination treatment was associated with increased Grade 3 or higher adverse events (Noronha et al., 2019; 31411950, Hosomi et al., 2020; 31682542).

Amplification of FGFR1 has been correlated with protein expression (Kohler et al., 2012; 22648708, Kim et al., 2013; 23182986) and may predict pathway activation and sensitivity to therapies targeting this pathway (Andr\u00e9 et al., 2014; 24508104, Dienstmann et al., 2014; 24265351). In the TCGA datasets, FGFR1 amplification was found in 3% of lung adenocarcinoma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552) and 17% of lung SCC cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745); FGFR1 mutation was observed in 1% of lung adenocarcinoma and lung SCC (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745). The prognostic significance of FGFR1 alteration in lung adenocarcinoma has not been extensively studied, however, one analysis of 345 NSCLC cases (48% adenocarcinoma, 39% SCC, 7% large cell) suggested that high level amplification of FGFR1 was predictive of shorter survival (Gadgeel et al., 2013; 24255716). The association between FGFR1 amplification and clinical parameters in lung SCC is not clear; some studies have suggested that FGFR1 amplification is associated with poor prognosis, whereas other studies have reported no association (Cote et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract 7063) (Kim et al., 2013; 23182986, Heist et al., 2012; 23154548, Kohler et al., 2012; 22648708, Craddock et al., 2013; 24077455); one study reported significant association between FGFR1 amplification and improved OS in women (p=0.023) but not in men (p=0.423)(Flockerzi et al., 2018; 29270870).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942).

In one study of 55 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, TP53 alterations correlated with immunogenic features including PD_L1 expression, tumor mutation burden and neoantigen presentation; likely as a consequence of this association TP53 mutations correlated with improved clinical outcomes to PD_1 inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab in this study (Dong et al., 2016; 28039262). Mutations in TP53 have been associated with lymph node metastasis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (Seo et al., 2012; 22975805). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss.

A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 31.9% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73.4% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 42.9% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76.2% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24.0% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71.4% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75.0% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Additionally, the combination of a CHK1 inhibitor and irinotecan reportedly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival in a TP53_mutated, but not TP53_wild_type, breast cancer xenotransplant mouse model (Ma et al., 2012; 22446188). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may also be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as APR_246 (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571, Lehmann et al., 2012; 22965953, Mohell et al., 2015; 26086967, Franssonet al., 2016; 27179933). In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, APR_246 combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "04", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "04"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Spigel et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9017, Hellmann et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT077, Ramalingam et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT078, Kowanetz et al., 2016; ESMO Abstract 77P, Gandara et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 12950, Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Velcheti et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12001, Herbst et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA79, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT07, Castellanos et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 2630, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Colli et al., 2016; 27197178, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Wang et al., 2017; 28923100, Carbone et al., 2017; 28636851, Rizvi et al., 2018; 29337640, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Forde et al., 2018; 29658848, Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Miao et al., 2018; 30150660, Chae et al., 2019; 30425022, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526). A large_scale genomic analysis found that unspecified lung non_small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), lung adenocarcinoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) samples harbored median TMBs between 6.3 and 9 Muts/Mb, and 12% to 17% of cases had an elevated TMB of greater than 20 Muts/Mb (FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). Lower TMB is observed more commonly in NSCLCs harboring known driver mutations (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, or MET) with the exception of BRAF or KRAS mutations, which are commonly observed in elevated TMB cases (Spigel et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9017). Although some studies have reported a lack of association between smoking and mutational burden in NSCLC (Schwartz et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 8533, Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843, Shim et al., 2015; 26200269), several other large studies did find a strong association with increased TMB (Govindan et al., 2012; 22980976, Ding et al., 2008; 18948947, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Kim et al., 2014; 24323028). TMB >10 muts/Mb was found to be more frequent in NSCLC metastases compared with primary tumors for both adenocarcinoma (38% vs. 25%) and SCC (41% vs. 35%) subtypes (Stein et al., 2019; DOI: 10.1200/PO.18.00376). A large study of Chinese patients with lung adenocarcinoma reported a shorter median OS for tumors with a higher number of mutations in a limited gene set compared with a lower mutation number (48.4 vs. 61.0 months)(Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843). Another study of patients with NSCLC correlated elevated TMB with poorer prognosis and significantly associated lower TMB in combination with PD_L1 negative status with longer median survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). However, no significant prognostic association of TMB and/or PD_L1 status with survival has been reported in patients with lung SCC (Yu et al., 2019; 30253973, Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). Multiple clinical trials of PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors or combination of PD_1 and CTLA_4 inhibitors in NSCLC have reported that patients with tumors harboring TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb derive greater clinical benefit from these therapies than those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb (based on this assay or others); similarly, higher efficacy of anti_PD_1 or anti_PD_L1 immunotherapy for treatment of patients with NSCLC, compared with the use of chemotherapy, has been observed more significantly in cases of TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (based on this assay or others); (Spigel et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9017, Hellmann et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT077, Ramalingam et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT078, Kowanetz et al., 2016; ESMO Abstract 77P, Gandara et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 12950, Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Velcheti et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12001, Herbst et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA79, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT07, Castellanos et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 2630, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Colli et al., 2016; 27197178, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Wang et al., 2017; 28923100, Carbone et al., 2017; 28636851, Rizvi et al., 2018; 29337640, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Forde et al., 2018; 29658848, Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Miao et al., 2018; 30150660, Chae et al., 2019; 30425022). Improved OS of patients with NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy relative to chemotherapy only (Paz_Ares et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA80), or those treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab also relative to chemotherapy (Hellmann et al., 2019; 31562796), has been observed across all TMB levels.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "EGFR", "Alteration": "exon 19 deletion (S752_I759del)", "Title": "A Global Study to Assess the Effects of Osimertinib Following Chemoradiation in Patients With Stage III Unresectable Non_small Cell Lung Cancer (LAURA)", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 3", "Target": "EGFR", "Locations": "Taipei (Taiwan), Taoyuan (Taiwan), Taichung (Taiwan), Tainan City (Taiwan), Linhai (China), Hangzhou (China), Shanghai (China), Nanjing (China), Beijing (China), Guangzhou (China)", "NCTID": "NCT03521154", "Note": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.
