The PI3K pathway is involved in cell signaling that regulates a number of critical cellular functions, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival (Samuels et al., 2005; 15950905, Engelman, 2009; 19629070). PIK3CA alterations that have been characterized as activating, such as observed here, are predicted to be oncogenic (Kang et al., 2005; 15647370, Ikenoue et al., 2005; 15930273, Gymnopoulos et al., 2007; 17376864, Horn et al., 2008; 18317450, Rudd et al., 2011; 21266528, Hon et al., 2012; 22120714, Burke et al., 2012; 22949682, Wu et al., 2009; 19915146, Dbouk et al., 2010; 2103068, Dan et al., 2010; 20530683, Oda et al., 2008; 18829572, Zhao and Vogt, 2008; 18794883, Lui et al., 2013; 23619167, Ross et al., 2013; 22430209, Riviere et al., 2012; 22729224, Shibata et al., 2009; 19394761, Droguluk et al., 2015; 26627007,Croessmann et al., 2018; 29284706, Ng et al., 2018; 29533785, Spangle et al., 2020; 32929011, Chen et al., 2018; 29636477). PIK3CA amplification has been reported in 5% of cases in the Stomach Adenocarcinoma TCGA dataset (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317). PIK3CA mutation was observed in 20% of gastric adenocarcinoma cases in the TCGA dataset (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317) and in 5.5% of cases in a genomic study of esophageal adenocarcinoma (cBio_Dulak et al., 2013; 23525077). A study of 38 esophagogastric cancer patients did not identify any PIK3CA mutations (Tebbutt et al., 2013; 23412099). Mutations in PIK3CA have been reported to be recurrent driver events in esophageal adenocarcinoma (Dulak et al., 2013; 23525077). PIK3CA alterations have been linked with poor prognosis in gastric carcinoma (Wu, 2010; 20491626, Shi et al., 2012; 22292935). In addition, increased PIK3CA mRNA and p110_alpha expression have been identified in gastric cancer lymph node metastases, suggesting that PIK3CA may be an indicator of gastric cancer metastasis (Liu et al., 2010; 20954287). PIK3CA amplification has been observed in gastric carcinomas and is significantly associated with a poor prognosis (Shi et al., 2012; 22292935). Clinical and preclinical data in various tumor types indicate that PIK3CA activating alterations may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting PI3K (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574, Juric et al., 2018; 29401002, Gallant et al., 2019; 30793038), AKT (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Smyth et al., 2021; 33863913), or mTOR (Park et al., 2016; 27105424, Lim et al., 2016; 26859683, Hou et al., 2014; 25426553, Varnier et al., 2019; 31351267, Janku et al., 2014; 24440717, Moroney et al., 2012; 22927482, Basho et al., 2017; 27893038, Moroney et al., 2011; 21890452). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with PIK3CA_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 33.3% (8/24) ORR with the AKT inhibitor capivasertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). Patients with PIK3CA E542K mutation experienced numerically higher ORR compared to the non_E542K group (50.0% [4/8] vs. 18.8% [3/16]); 0.0% (0/4) patients with H1047R mutation responded to capivasertib (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). Activating mutations in PIK3CA may confer resistance to HER2_targeted therapies; combined inhibition of HER2 and the PI3K pathway may be required in HER2_positive tumors with PIK3CA mutation (Esteva et al., 2010; 20813970, Baselga et al., 2014; 25332247, Chakrabarty et al., 2010; 20581867, Cizkova et al., 2010; San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium Abstract P2_09_30, Kataoka et al., 2010; 19633047, Wang et al., 2011; 21676217).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PIK3CA activating mutations may lead to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may therefore indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.

Studies have reported modest activity of these therapies as single agents (ORRs of 0_4%), but improved activity has been observed when they are combined with other agents such as bevacizumab and doxorubicin (ORRs of 25_44%), for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors (Janku et al., 2014; 24440717, Janku et al., 2013; 23066039, Janku et al., 2012; 22271473, Janku et al., 2011; 21216929, Moroney et al., 2012; 22927482, Moroney et al., 2011; 21890452, Basho et al., 2017; 27893038, Moulder et al., 2015; 25878190, Byeon et al., 2020; doi: 10.21037/tcr.2020.04.07). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> A Phase 3 study of everolimus monotherapy in previously treated patients with advanced gastric cancer reported no significant improvement in overall survival; however, improved progression_free survival of 1.7 months with everolimus monotherapy compared with 1.4 months with placebo was observed (Van Cutsem et al., 2012; GI ASCO Abstract LBA3). A Phase 2 clinical trial of everolimus in advanced gastric cancer reported partial response in 2/54 (4%) patients, although the authors suggested that response rates could be improved with selection based on biomarker status (Yoon et al., 2012; 22343617). A separate Phase 2 clinical trial of everolimus in advanced gastric cancer reported no complete or partial responses, but reported tumor shrinkage in 45% (24/53) of patients (Doi et al., 2010; 20231677). In a Phase 1 trial of everolimus in patients with advanced solid tumors, one patient with esophageal cancer and one patient with gastric adenocarcinoma exhibited marked tumor shrinkage (Okamoto et al., 2010; 19783551). Phase 1 trials of everolimus in combination with capecitabine or mitomycin C in metastatic gastric/gastroesophageal cancer have reported some clinical benefit (Lim et al., 2011; 21526353, Werner et al., 2013; 23930209). Whereas frequent adverse events precluded a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for the combination of trametinib and everolimus in a Phase 1b trial for solid tumors (Tolcher et al., 2014; 25344362), a retrospective study for heavily pretreated patients with solid tumors reported tolerable regimens of the combination for 23/31 patients, with 16 patients treated >3 months and evaluable patients achieving a median PFS of 6.5 months (Patterson et al., 2018; AACR Abstract 3891). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Temsirolimus", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Temsirolimus is an intravenous mTOR inhibitor that is FDA approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma.

High bTMB levels were not detected in this sample. It is unclear whether the bTMB levels in this sample would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Depending on the clinical context, TMB testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. Average bTMB levels in solid tumors other than NSCLC have not been evaluated (cBioPortal, COSMIC, PubMed, Mar 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). For patients with gastric cancer, increased TMB is reported to be associated with prolonged OS (Cai et al., 2020; 32141230, Zhao et al., 2021; 33510848, Wei et al., 2021; 33613701). One study observed that the OS and disease_free survival (DFS) benefits of postoperative chemotherapy were more pronounced in patients with TMB_low gastric cancer (stage Ib/II) compared to those with TMB_high; however, patients with stage III gastric cancer benefitted regardless of TMB level (Wang et al., 2021; 33687617). In esophageal cancer, patients with TMB_high who had not received radiotherapy had significantly reduced OS (p=0.038) compared to those with TMB_low (Yuan et al., 2019; 32165590). On the basis of clinical evidence in NSCLC and HSNCC, increased bTMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511) and anti_PD_1 (Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074) therapies. In NSCLC, multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 to 16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). In HNSCC, a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Cannot Be Determined", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Cannot Be Determined"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. In the context of diffuse_type gastric cancer, a higher frequency of MSI_H tumors has been reported in familial (28%, 7/25) versus sporadic (7%, 7/107) tumors; no difference in frequency of MSI_H tumors was observed for intestinal_type gastric cancer (Fang et al., 2013; 23555086). MSI_H tumors have been frequently associated with hypermethylation and loss of MLH1 expression in cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract, including esophageal, gastroesophageal junction, and gastric adenocarcinomas (Fang et al., 2013; 23555086, Gu et al., 2009; 19621725, Sasaki et al., 2011; 22866067, Fleisher et al., 1999; 10070967, Vasavi et al., 2010; 21045259, Zhang et al., 2013; 24035280). MSI_H gastric cancers are associated with certain clinicopathological and molecular features, including intestinal type differentiation, antral location, advanced age, reduced lymph node metastasis, and better prognosis (Zhu et al., 2015; 26137290, Leung et al., 1999; 9892201, dos Santos et al., 1996; 8536886, Wu et al., 1998; 9537253, Seo et al., 2015; 26078567, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317). A retrospective meta_analysis of the prognostic role of MSI in gastric cancers reported an increased DFS and OS in patients with MSI_H versus MSS/MSI_Low (Pietrantonio et al., 2019; 31513484). Conversely, in the same study, MSI_H was a negative predictor of response and MSS/MSI_Low correlated with increased benefit for patients treated with chemotherapy plus surgery as opposed to surgery alone (Pietrantonio et al., 2019; 31513484). In gastroesophageal cancer, MSI_H status was associated with shorter PFS compared to MSS patients for patients treated with chemotherapy (mPFS 4.8 months vs 6.9 months, HR=0.4) (Janjigian et al., 2018; 29122777). On the basis of prospective clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD_1_targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143) and PD_L1_targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92). As the MSI status of this tumor is unknown, the relevance of these therapeutic approaches is unclear. While approximately 80% of MSI_H tumors arise due to somatic inactivation of an MMR pathway protein, about 20% arise due to germline mutations in one of the MMR genes (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942), which are associated with a condition known as Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC) (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756). Lynch syndrome leads to an increased risk of colorectal, endometrial, gastric, and other cancers (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756, Pande et al., 2012; 22714864, Kastrinos and Syngal, 2007; 17920897) and has an estimated prevalence in the general population ranging from 1:600 to 1:2000 (Silva et al., 2009; 19466295, Sehgal et al., 2014; 24978665, de la Chapelle et al., 2005; 16136383). Therefore, in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "R158G", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "R158G"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 is frequently mutated in cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, with alterations reported in 34\u201372% of esophageal, gastroesophageal junction, and gastric adenocarcinomas (Dulak et al., 2013; 23525077, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317, Sengpiel et al., 2009; 19160092, P\u00fchringer_Oppermann et al., 2006; 16538517). Overexpression of p53 protein, which may occur as a result of mutation, has been reported in approximately 36% of gastric cancers, with p53 expression reported to be more frequent in intestinal_type compared with diffuse_type gastric cancer (Lee et al., 2014; 23969480, Sezer et al., 2013; 23613399, Victorzon et al., 1996; 8664030, Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2011; 21116760). While some studies have reported no association between TP53 mutation status and prognosis in patients with esophageal carcinoma or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (Sengpiel et al., 2009; 19160092, P\u00fchringer_Oppermann et al., 2006; 16538517) others have associated TP53 mutation and elevated p53 expression with poor prognosis for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Han et al., 2007; 17760650, Yamasaki et al., 2010; 19941080) or stomach cancer (Liu et al., 2012; 23285001, Wiksten et al., 2008; 18751407, Migliavacca et al., 2004; 15254976). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% (17/176) and SDs in 53.4% (94/176) of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21.1% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12.1% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wild_type (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 31.9% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73.4% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 42.9% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76.2% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24.0% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71.4% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75.0% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Additionally, the combination of a CHK1 inhibitor and irinotecan reportedly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival in a TP53_mutated, but not TP53_wild_type, breast cancer xenotransplant mouse model (Ma et al., 2012; 22446188). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may also be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as APR_246 (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571, Lehmann et al., 2012; 22965953, Mohell et al., 2015; 26086967, Franssonet al., 2016; 27179933). In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, APR_246 combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Fraction", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor fraction provides an estimate of the percentage of ctDNA present in a cell_free DNA (cfDNA) sample. The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with elevated tumor fraction have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus high sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at low risk of false negative results. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels. In the research setting, changes in tumor fraction estimates have been associated with treatment duration and clinical response and may be a useful indicator for future cancer management (Bronkhorst et al., 2019; 30923679, Raja et al., 2018; 30093454, Hrebien et al., 2019; 30860573, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5039, Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Goodall et al., 2017; 28450425, Goldberg et al., 2018; 29330207).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "PIK3CA", "Alteration": "E542K", "Title": "Tumor_Agnostic Precision Immuno_Oncology and Somatic Targeting Rational for You (TAPISTRY) Platform Study", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "ALK, ROS1, TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, RET, PD_L1, AKTs, ERBB2, MDM2, PI3K_alpha", "Locations": "Zhongzheng Dist.
