APC interacts with beta_catenin and controls signaling in the WNT pathway, which regulates embryonic development and cell differentiation (Logan and Nusse, 2004; 15473860). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt APC function or expression (Eklof et al., 2001; 11707392, Liu et al., 2006; 16753179, Dikovskaya et al., 2010; 20144988, Murphy et al., 2007; 17410430, Aretz et al., 2004; 15459959). APC mutations have been reported in 8.2% (8/97) of sinonasal and nasal cavity tumors analyzed in COSMIC (Jan 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Small studies of sinonasal adenocarcinomas in the literature have reported APC mutations in 0_30% of samples (Yom et al., 2005; 15492756, Frattini et al., 2006; 16906516). Hypermethylation of the APC promoter, likely to result in downregulation of Apc expression, has been frequently reported various types of head and neck carcinomas, including laryngeal papilloma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and mixed exocrine_neuroendocrine carcinoma of the nasal cavity (Stephen et al., 2010; 21603083, Loyo et al., 2011; 20473931, Chen et al., 2007; 18025318, La et al., 2013; 22740238). An analysis of a mixed exocrine_neuroendocrine carcinoma of the nasal cavity found reduced Apc protein expression in the neuroendocrine component only, correlating with APC promoter methylation and copy number loss (La et al., 2013; 22740238). Studies on the prognostic effect of APC alterations in sinonasal and nasal cavity tumors are limited (PubMed, Mar 2021). Solid tumors with WNT/beta_catenin pathway alterations, as seen here, were observed to have significantly less T_cell inflammation in one study (Luke et al., 2019; 30635339). There are no approved drugs targeting APC inactivation in cancer. Loss of APC function leads to accumulation of beta_catenin and upregulation of WNT pathway transcription programs (Zhan et al., 2017; 27617575), and potential therapeutic approaches to target this pathway include CBP/beta_catenin antagonists, which interfere with the ability of beta_catenin to interact with transcriptional co_activator CBP (Jung et al., 2020; 32037398, Krishnamurthy and Kurzrock, 2018; 29169144). In a Phase 1 trial of the CBP/beta_catenin antagonist E7386, 1 patient with APC_mutated small bowel adenocarcinoma achieved a PR with tumor shrinkage of _69% and response duration of 165 days (Kawazoe et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 473P); preclinical data support sensitivity of APC_deficient gastric or colorectal cancer models to E7386 (Yamada et al., 2021; 33408116, Kanda et al., 2022; 34837838). Germline mutations in APC are found in more than 90% of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) (Kerr et al., 2013; 23159591, Fearon, 2011; 21090969, Kastritis et al., 2009; 18844223). The prevalence for FAP in the general population is estimated to be 1:8,300 from birth (Half et al., 2009; 19822006), and in the appropriate clinical context germline testing of APC is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Based on preclinical and limited clinical data, APC inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to CBP/beta_catenin interaction inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT03833700", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04008797", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03264664", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "CCND1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "CCND1 encodes cyclin D1, a binding partner of the kinases CDK4 and CDK6, that regulates RB activity and cell cycle progression. Amplification of CCND1 has been positively correlated with cyclin D1 overexpression (Elsheikh et al., 2008; 17653856) and may lead to excessive proliferation (Fu et al., 2004; 15331580, Takahashi_Yanaga and Sasaguri, 2008; 18023328). Amplification of CCND1 has been observed in 28_45% of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cases, including 63% of pharyngeal carcinomas, 37% of laryngeal, and 25% of oral carcinomas (HNSCC_Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2015; 25631445, Hanken et al., 2014; 23494454, Rodrigo et al., 2009; 18991334). A study reported cyclin D1 expression in 66% of HNSCC samples (Sakashita et al., 2013; 23692432). CCND1 amplification or overexpression has been associated with advanced disease, lymph node metastasis, and decreased overall and disease_free survival in patients with HNSCC (Maruyama et al., 2010; 19963131, Rasamny et al., 2012; 22323434, Rodrigo et al., 2009; 18991334, Sakashita et al., 2013; 23692432, Sugahara et al., 2011; 21701773). CCND1 or CCND3 protein expression may also associate with cisplatin resistance in HNSCC (Zhang et al., 2006; 16978399). Amplification or overexpression of CCND1 may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib (Juric et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 568, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Tolaney et al., 2016; SABCS P4_22_12, Morschhauser et al., 2020; 32381571, Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27217383, Leonard et al., 2012; 22383795), although as monotherapy these agents have shown limited activity in tumor types other than breast cancer (Dickler et al., 2017; 28533223, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27217383). In refractory advanced solid tumors with CCND1 (n=39) or CCND3 (n=1) amplification and retinoblastoma protein expression, palbociclib resulted in SD for 39% (14/36) of patients and a median PFS of 1.8 months in the NCI_MATCH trial (Clark et al., 2019; AACR Abstract LB_010/2); 4 patients (13%, 4/36 overall) with squamous cell carcinomas (lung, esophageal, or laryngeal) or adenoid cystic carcinoma experienced prolonged SD in this study (Clark et al., 2019; AACR Abstract LB_010/2). Among 9 patients with CCND1_amplified advanced solid tumors, 1 patient with bladder cancer responded to ribociclib in a Phase 2 trial (Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528). Two of 3 patients with advanced solid tumors and concurrent alterations in CCND1/3 and NOTCH1, as seen here, achieved prolonged SD on palbociclib in the exploratory analysis of NCI_MATCH (Clark et al., 2019; AACR Abstract LB_010/2). CCND1 amplification may predict worse outcomes on immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti_PD_1/PD_L1/CTLA_4) in solid tumors on the basis of 2 meta_analyses (Chen et al., 2020; 32903763, Litchfield et al., 2021; 33508232); in these studies, CCND1 amplification was associated with significantly decreased response rate (Litchfield et al., 2021; 33508232) and OS (HR=1.6_2.0)(Chen et al., 2020; 32903763, Litchfield et al., 2021; 33508232) across various tumor types and significantly shorter OS specifically in urothelial carcinoma (HR=2.2_3.6), melanoma (HR=1.6_2.5), and solid tumors harboring elevated TMB (HR=2.8)(Chen et al., 2020; 32903763, Litchfield et al., 2021; 33508232).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "CCND1 amplification or overexpression may activate CDK4/6 and may predict sensitivity to single_agent CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04282031", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03297606", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05252416", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02896335", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "CDK6", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "true", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "CDK6 encodes cyclin_dependent kinase 6, which regulates the cell cycle, differentiation, senescence, and apoptosis (Meyerson et al., 1994; 8114739, Grossel and Hinds, 2006; 16294322, Choi et al., 2014; 23644662). CDK6 and its functional homolog CDK4 are activated by D_type cyclins and promote cell cycle progression by inactivating the tumor suppressor Rb (Weinberg et al., 1995; 7736585, Musgrove et al., 2011; 21734724). Amplification of the chromosomal region that includes CDK6 has been reported in multiple cancer types, and has been associated with overexpression of CDK6 protein (Ismail et al., 2011; 21593195, van Dekken et al., 2009; 19167610). No alterations in CDK6 were reported in 56 samples analyzed in the Singapore Nasopharynx TCGA dataset (cBio_Lin et al., 2014; 24952746). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of CDK6 alterations in head and neck carcinomas are limited (PubMed, Jan 2021). Tumors with CDK6 activation may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib (Infante et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 2528, Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Finn et al., 2014; 25524798, Turner et al., 2015; 26030518, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27217383). Clinical benefit has been reported for patients with CDK6_amplified or mutated solid tumors in response to treatment with ribociclib (Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Konecny et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5557).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Tumors with CDK6 amplification may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04282031", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03239015", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04594005", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02693535", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03994796", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05252416", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02896335", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03310879", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "MTAP", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "loss exons 6_8", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "loss exons 6_8"}}, "Interpretation": "MTAP encodes S_methyl_5 _thioadenosine (MTA) phosphorylase, a tumor suppressor involved in polyamine metabolism and methionine synthesis, although its enzymatic function is dispensable for its tumor suppressor activity (Limm et al., 2016; 27479139, Tang et al., 2014; 25387827). Decreased expression of MTAP leads to MTA accumulation within tumor cells and their microenvironment (Kirovski et al., 2011; 21356366, Limm et al., 2013; 23265702, Stevens et al., 2009; 19097084), thereby reducing intracellular arginine methylation (Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473, Mavrakis et al., 2016; 26912361, Kryukov et al., 2016; 26912360) and altering cell signaling (Limm et al., 2014; 25087184, Stevens et al., 2009; 19097084). MTAP is located at 9p21, adjacent to CDKN2A and CDKN2B, with which it is frequently co_deleted in various cancers. Other alterations in MTAP are rare and have not been extensively characterized. MTAP loss/homozygous deletion as well as loss of expression has been reported in a wide variety of solid tumors and hematologic cancers (Wei et al., 2016; 27929028, Zhao and Zhao, 2016; 27556634); such events have been correlated with poor prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (Kirovski et al., 2011; 21356366), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (Huang et al., 2009; 19887491), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)(Marce et al., 2006; 16778103), melanoma (Meyer et al., 2010; 20500769, Wild et al., 2006; 16618867), gastric cancer (Kim et al., 2011; 21412930), myxofibrosarcoma (Li et al., 2014; 25426549), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (He et al., 2015; 26656376), ovarian carcinoma (Wei et al., 2016; 27929028) and non_small cell lung cancer (Su et al., 2014; 24969958). MTAP loss was not prognostic in pediatric B_cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (Mirebeau et al., 2006; 16818274) or in astrocytoma (Becker et al., 2015; 26088413). However, MTAP has also been reported to be overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (Snezhkina et al., 2016; 27433286), and MTAP retention is thought to be important for prostate cancer growth due to continuous supply of SAM (Bistulfi et al., 2016; 26910893). Germline SNPs in MTAP have been correlated with the development of cutaneous melanoma (Antonopoulou et al., 2015; 25407435, Mccioni et al., 2013; 23816148), esophageal cancer (Hyland et al., 2016; 26635288, Lin et al., 2017; 27960044), osteosarcoma (Zhi et al., 2016; 27994653), and CRC (Gu et al., 2013; 23361049). Preclinical and limited clinical evidence indicate that MTAP inactivation produces specific metabolic vulnerabilities. MTAP inactivation may confer sensitivity to MAT2A inhibitors (Heist et al., 2019; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract B116, Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473). A Phase 1 trial of MAT2A inhibitor AG_270 reported 1 PR and 2 SDs lasting longer than 6 months for patients with advanced solid tumors displaying MTAP loss (Heist et al., 2019; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract B116). Although preclinical data have suggested that MTAP loss sensitizes cells to PRMT5 inhibition (Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473, Mavrakis et al., 2016; 26912361, Kryukov et al., 2016; 2691236), MTAP loss may not be a biomarker of response to previously developed small_molecule SAM_uncompetitive PRMT5 inhibitors (Guccione and Richard, 2019; 31350521); dual PRMT1 and PRMT5 inhibition may be more effective (Fedoriw et al., 2019; 31257072, Srour et al., 2019; 31287990, Gao et al., 2019; 30916320). In preclinical cancer models, MTAP inactivation showed increased sensitivity to inhibitors of purine synthesis or purine analogs, especially upon addition of exogenous MTA, which is converted to adenine in normal cells, thereby providing competition to purine poisons lacking in MTAP_deficient cells (Hansen et al., 2019; 31040154, Tang et al., 2018; 29844120, Munshi et al., 2014; 24928612, de Oliveira et al., 2016; 26751376, Lubin and Lubin, 2009; 19478948, Tang et al., 2012; 22825330, Collins et al., 2012; 22252602, Bertino et al., 2011; 21301207, Coulthard et al., 2011; 21282358, Miyazaki et al., 2007; 17912432, Efferth et al., 2002; 11987241). A Phase 2 study of L_alanosine, an inhibitor of adenine synthesis, as a monotherapy for 65 patients with MTAP_deficient cancers reported no responses and stable disease in 23.6% (13/55) of patients (Kindler et al., 2009; 18618081).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "MTAP loss may predict sensitivity to MAT2A inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": {"nctId": "NCT03435250", "Include": "true"}}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "PIK3CA", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "E726K", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "E726K"}}, "Interpretation": "PIK3CA encodes p110_alpha, which is the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3_kinase (PI3K).

PIK3CA alterations that have been characterized as activating, such as observed here, are predicted to be oncogenic (Kang et al., 2005; 15647370, Ikenoue et al., 2005; 15930273, Gymnopoulos et al., 2007; 17376864, Horn et al., 2008; 18317450, Rudd et al., 2011; 21266528, Hon et al., 2012; 22120714, Burke et al., 2012; 22949682, Wu et al., 2009; 19915146, Dbouk et al., 2010; 2103068, Dan et al., 2010; 20530683, Oda et al., 2008; 18829572, Zhao and Vogt, 2008; 18794883, Lui et al., 2013; 23619167, Ross et al., 2013; 22430209, Riviere et al., 2012; 22729224, Shibata et al., 2009; 19394761, Droguluk et al., 2015; 26627007, Croessmann et al., 2018; 29284706, Ng et al., 2018; 29533785, Spangle et al., 2020; 32929011, Chen et al., 2018; 29636477, Jin et al., 2021; 34779417). Two studies have reported PIK3CA mutation in 4.9_9.6% of nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC)(Chou et al., 2009; 19012001, Zhang et al., 2014; 24672248), whereas several studies have reported that PIK3CA amplification and overexpression occur frequently in NPC, but that PIK3CA mutations are infrequent (cBio_Lin et al., 2014; 24952746, Or et al., 2006; 16114017, Fendri et al., 2009; 19735264, Jiang et al., 2014; 25109408, Zhang et al., 2015; 25963410, Hui et al., 2002; 11836556). PIK3CA amplification and expression have been reported in 20% and 44% of NPCs, respectively (Yip et al., 2016; 26581613). PIK3CA mutations were detected in 7.1% of head and neck carcinomas (COSMIC, Jun 2021)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). In one study, PI3K mutations were prevalent in advanced Stage 4 HNSCC tumors and associated with tumor progression (Lui et al., 2013; 23619167). PIK3CA amplification has been found to be associated with poor prognosis in HNSCC (Suda et al., 2012; 22994622, Fenic et al., 2007; 17549376, Sticht et al., 2005; 15700036). PIK3CA amplification has been associated with more aggressive disease in NPC (Fendri et al., 2009; 19735264), although another study found that PIK3CA mutation did not affect disease_specific survival (Chou et al., 2009; 19012001). Clinical and preclinical data in various tumor types indicate that PIK3CA activating alterations may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting PI3K (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574, Juric et al., 2018; 29401002, Gallant et al., 2019; 30793038, Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23, Delestre et al., 2021; 34613809, Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Santin et al., 2020; 31934607, Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871), AKT (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Smyth et al., 2021; 33863913), or mTOR (Park et al., 2016; 27105424, Lim et al., 2016; 26859683, Hou et al., 2014; 25426553, Varnier et al., 2019; 31351267, Janku et al., 2014; 24440717, Moroney et al., 2012; 22927482, Basho et al., 2017; 27893038, Moroney et al., 2011; 21890452). The Phase 2 NCI_MATCH study of copanlisib for patients with refractory solid tumors harboring PIK3CA mutations with or without PTEN loss met its primary endpoint with an ORR of 16% (4/25 PRs); responses (PR or SD >6 months) were seen in patients with ameloblastoma, liposarcoma, and carcinomas of the endometrium, ovary, esophagus, lung, and prostate (Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871). However, the Phase 2 study of copanlisib for patients with endometrial carcinoma harboring PIK3CA hotspot mutations failed to report any objective responses (n=11)(Santin et al., 2020; 31934607). Two other studies of copanlisib for patients with genomically unselected tumors reported 1 CR and 2 PRs (1 unconfirmed) among 16 total patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors with or without PTEN alterations (Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108). In the Phase 2 MATCH trial for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors, 28% (18/65) of patients experienced PFS lasting at least 6 months after treatment with taselisib; however, no ORs were observed in this study (Krop et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 101). A separate Phase 1b study of taselisib in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors reported an ORR of 0% (n=12) and a DCR of 17% (2/12) (Pascual et al., 2021; 32958578). In a Phase 1 trial of the dual PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitor apitolisib, 79% (11/14) of patients with PIK3CA_mutated advanced solid tumors experienced disease control (3 PRs, 8 SDs) (Dolly et al., 2016; 26787751). The PI3K inhibitor alpelisib is approved as a single agent for the treatment of patients with PIK3CA_related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) (Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23), but has shown limited activity as monotherapy for PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors with a Phase 1a study reporting an ORR of 6.0% (8/134) and a DCR of 58% (78/134) (Juric et al., 2018; 2941002).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PIK3CA activating mutations may lead to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may therefore indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.

A Phase 2 study of everolimus therapy has reported no objective responses in any of nine patients with refractory head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (Varadarajan et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract 5541). A Phase 1 trial in patients with advanced solid tumors reported that everolimus in combination with low dose weekly cisplatin showed activity in several tumor types, with three partial responses and prolonged stable disease observed in five patients out of 28 evaluable patients; one patient with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma obtained stable disease after more than 6 cycles of treatments (Fury et al., 2012; 21913034).

This sample harbors a TMB level that may be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors in multiple solid tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). Head and neck carcinoma, including squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, harbors a median TMB of 3.8 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), with a higher median TMB of 5 muts/Mb in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) specifically, and 5.8% of cases [10.1% of HNSCC cases specifically] have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of TMB in nasopharyngeal and sinonasal carcinoma are limited (PubMed, Oct 2021). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, higher TMB has been reported to be associated with increased ORR and OS from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). Higher TMB was found to be significantly associated with improved OS upon immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment for patients with 9 types of advanced tumors (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254). Analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy, compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386). However, the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors found significant improvement in ORR for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (based on this assay or others) compared to those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb, in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types; similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). Together, these studies suggest that patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb may derive clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1 inhibitors. In the first_line setting for patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), the Phase 3 JUPITER_02 study of the anti_PD_1 antibody toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy reported significantly improved median PFS relative to chemotherapy plus placebo (11.7 vs. 8.0 months, HR=0.52); median PFS improved regardless of PD_L1 status (Mai et al., 2021; 34341578).

Both p15INK4b and p16INK4a bind to and inhibit CDK4 and CDK6, thereby maintaining the growth_suppressive activity of the Rb tumor suppressor; loss or inactivation of either p15INK4b or p16INK4a contributes to dysregulation of the CDK4/6_cyclin_Rb pathway and loss of cell cycle control (Gazzeri et al., 1998; 9484839, Roussel, 1999; 10498883). The tumor suppressive functions of p14ARF involve stabilization and activation of p53, via a mechanism of MDM2 inhibition (Sherr et al., 2005; 16869746, Ozenne et al., 2010; 20549699).

One or more alterations seen here are predicted to result in p14ARF loss of function (Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Itahana and Zhang, 2008; 18538737, Zhang and Xiong, 1999; 10360174, Zhang et al., 1998; 9529249, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). CDKN2B alterations such as seen here are predicted to inactivate p15INK4b (Jafri et al., 2015; 25873077). Mutation in CDKN2A or CDKN2B has been detected in 1.1% (1/90) and 0% (0/21) sinonasal carcinomas analyzed in COSMIC, respectively (Jan 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). In a genomic analysis of 56 nasopharyngeal carcinoma cases, mutation of CDKN2B was detected in 2% (1/56) of samples, while CDKN2A mutation was absent (cBio_Lin et al., 2014; 24952746, (Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). In another study of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, p16INK4a homozygous deletion was observed in 35% (7/20) of cases (Lo et al., 1995; 7743498). CDKN2A and CDKN2B were identified as susceptibility loci in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Bei et al., 2010; 20512145). Inactivation of CDKN2A and CDKN2B by gene methylation was reported to be common in undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma, with CDKN2A methylation occurring in 23_42% of cases and CDKN2B methylation occurring in 20_50% of cases (Wong et al., 2003; 12632081, Wong et al., 2004; 15073117). CDKN2A is also often inactivated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) through deletion, promoter methylation, or mutation (Pierini et al., 2013; 23804521, Lechner et al., 2013; 23718828, Reed et al., 1996; 8705996). In the context of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, loss of p16INK4a correlated with worse overall survival (Makitie et al., 2003; 12796384) and local recurrence (Hwang et al., 2002; 12181248). Preclinical data suggest that tumors with loss of p16INK4a function may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, ribociclib, and palbociclib (Konecny et al., 2011; 21278246, Katsumi et al., 2011; 21871868, Cen et al., 2012; 22711607, Logan et al., 2013; 23898052). Although case studies have reported that patients with breast cancer or uterine leiomyosarcoma harboring CDKN2A loss responded to palbociclib treatment (Elvin et al., 2017; 28283584, Gao et al., 2015; 26715889), multiple other clinical studies have shown no significant correlation between p16INK4a loss or inactivation and therapeutic benefit of these agents (Gopalan et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8077, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Konecny et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5557)(DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Johnson et al., 2014; 24797823); it is not known whether CDK4/6 inhibitors would be beneficial in this case. Although preclinical studies have suggested that loss of p14ARF function may be associated with reduced sensitivity to MDM2 inhibitors (Van Maerken et al., 2011; 21460101, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357), the clinical relevance of p14ARF as a predictive biomarker is not clear. There are no drugs that directly target the mutation or loss of CDKN2B in cancer. Because the p15INK4b protein encoded by CDKN2B is known to inhibit CDK4, tumors with CDKN2B mutation or loss may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as ribociclib, abemaciclib, and palbociclib (Infante et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 2528, Shapiro et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 2500)(Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126). Germline CDKN2A mutation is associated with melanoma_pancreatic cancer syndrome, a condition marked by increased risk of developing malignant melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer (Whelan et al., 1995; 7666917). Mutation carriers within families may develop either or both types of cancer, and melanoma cases may be referred to as familial or hereditary melanoma (Hansson, 2010; 20687502, Hogg et al., 1998; 9479083). CDKN2A is the most implicated gene in familial melanoma, with germline mutations present in 16% to 20% of familial melanoma cases (De Unamuno et al., 2018; 29543703, Soura et al., 2016; 26892650, Huerta et al., 2018; 29405243). CDKN2A alteration has also been implicated in familial melanoma_astrocytoma syndrome, an extremely rare tumor association characterized by dual predisposition to melanoma and nervous system tumors (Kaufman et al., 1993; 8414022, Bahuau et al., 1998; 9622062, Chan et al., 2017; 28699883).

One or more alterations seen here are predicted to result in p14ARF loss of function (Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Itahana and Zhang, 2008; 18538737, Zhang and Xiong, 1999; 10360174, Zhang et al., 1998; 9529249, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). CDKN2B alterations such as seen here are predicted to inactivate p15INK4b (Jafri et al., 2015; 25873077). Mutation in CDKN2A or CDKN2B has been detected in 1.1% (1/90) and 0% (0/21) sinonasal carcinomas analyzed in COSMIC, respectively (Jan 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). In a genomic analysis of 56 nasopharyngeal carcinoma cases, mutation of CDKN2B was detected in 2% (1/56) of samples, while CDKN2A mutation was absent (cBio_Lin et al., 2014; 24952746, (Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). In another study of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, p16INK4a homozygous deletion was observed in 35% (7/20) of cases (Lo et al., 1995; 7743498). CDKN2A and CDKN2B were identified as susceptibility loci in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Bei et al., 2010; 20512145). Inactivation of CDKN2A and CDKN2B by gene methylation was reported to be common in undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma, with CDKN2A methylation occurring in 23_42% of cases and CDKN2B methylation occurring in 20_50% of cases (Wong et al., 2003; 12632081, Wong et al., 2004; 15073117). CDKN2A is also often inactivated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) through deletion, promoter methylation, or mutation (Pierini et al., 2013; 23804521, Lechner et al., 2013; 23718828, Reed et al., 1996; 8705996). In the context of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, loss of p16INK4a correlated with worse overall survival (Makitie et al., 2003; 12796384) and local recurrence (Hwang et al., 2002; 12181248). Preclinical data suggest that tumors with loss of p16INK4a function may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, ribociclib, and palbociclib (Konecny et al., 2011; 21278246, Katsumi et al., 2011; 21871868, Cen et al., 2012; 22711607, Logan et al., 2013; 23898052). Although case studies have reported that patients with breast cancer or uterine leiomyosarcoma harboring CDKN2A loss responded to palbociclib treatment (Elvin et al., 2017; 28283584, Gao et al., 2015; 26715889), multiple other clinical studies have shown no significant correlation between p16INK4a loss or inactivation and therapeutic benefit of these agents (Gopalan et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8077, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Konecny et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5557)(DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Johnson et al., 2014; 24797823); it is not known whether CDK4/6 inhibitors would be beneficial in this case. Although preclinical studies have suggested that loss of p14ARF function may be associated with reduced sensitivity to MDM2 inhibitors (Van Maerken et al., 2011; 21460101, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357), the clinical relevance of p14ARF as a predictive biomarker is not clear. There are no drugs that directly target the mutation or loss of CDKN2B in cancer. Because the p15INK4b protein encoded by CDKN2B is known to inhibit CDK4, tumors with CDKN2B mutation or loss may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as ribociclib, abemaciclib, and palbociclib (Infante et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 2528, Shapiro et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 2500)(Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126). Germline CDKN2A mutation is associated with melanoma_pancreatic cancer syndrome, a condition marked by increased risk of developing malignant melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer (Whelan et al., 1995; 7666917). Mutation carriers within families may develop either or both types of cancer, and melanoma cases may be referred to as familial or hereditary melanoma (Hansson, 2010; 20687502, Hogg et al., 1998; 9479083). CDKN2A is the most implicated gene in familial melanoma, with germline mutations present in 16% to 20% of familial melanoma cases (De Unamuno et al., 2018; 29543703, Soura et al., 2016; 26892650, Huerta et al., 2018; 29405243). CDKN2A alteration has also been implicated in familial melanoma_astrocytoma syndrome, an extremely rare tumor association characterized by dual predisposition to melanoma and nervous system tumors (Kaufman et al., 1993; 8414022, Bahuau et al., 1998; 9622062, Chan et al., 2017; 28699883). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of CDKN2A is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "EPHB4", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "true", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "EPHB4 encodes a member of the EPH family of receptor tyrosine kinases (Noren et al., 2007; 17483308). Ephrin signaling has been implicated in multiple processes, including cell adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, and cell migration (Pasquale, 2008; 18394988), and signaling between EPHB4 and its ligand EphrinB2 is particularly important for angiogenesis (Salvucci and Tosato, 2012; 22588055, Pitulescu and Adams, 2010; 21078817). EPHB receptors, including EPHB4, have been shown to undergo dysregulation (amplification, mutation, under_ or overexpression) in a number of different cancer types (Pasquale, 2010; 20179713). EPHB4 amplification has been reported in several solid tumor types (Hasina et al., 2013; 23100466, Boberg et al., 2013; 23063927, Masood et al., 2006; 16615113, Sinha et al., 2006; 17043250, Cromer et al., 2004; 14676830) and was associated with advanced disease stage in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (Sinha et al., 2006; 17043250). Activating missense mutations in or near the tyrosine kinase domain, including G723S, A742V, and P881S, have also been identified in lung cancer (Ferguson et al., 2015; 26073592). Increased EPHB4 mRNA and/or protein expression has been reported in a variety of cancer types, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (Sinha et al., 2006; 17043250, Masood et al., 2006; 16615113, Ferguson et al., 2014; 25391996, Yavrouian et al., 2008; 18794445), gastric and esophageal (Liersch_L\u00f6hn et al., 2016; 26414866, Hu et al., 2014; 24771266, Hasina et al., 2013; 23100466, Li et al., 2011; 20686847, Yin et al., 2017; 28739744), colorectal carcinoma (CRC) (Stephenson et al., 2001; 11801186, Liu et al., 2002; 11920461, McCall et al., 2016; 27273865, Stremitzer et al., 2016; 27535973, Lv et al., 2016; 27072105, Guijarro_Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2013; 23579861, Kumar et al., 2009; 19366806), breast (Wu et al., 2004; 15029258, Berclaz et al., 2002; 12168060, Brantley_Sieders et al., 2011; 21935409, Huang et al., 2015; 26191333, Pradeep et al., 2015; 26481148), ovarian (Pradeep et al., 2015; 26481148, Alam et al., 2008; 18231102, Kumar et al., 2007; 17353927), endometrial (Takai et al., 2001; 11295082, Dong et al., 2017; 28454369, Berclaz et al., 2003; 12562648), thyroid (Sharma et al., 2015; 24634162, Giaginis et al., 2016; 26220827, Xuqing et al., 2012; 22528941), lung (Ferguson et al., 2013; 23844053, Zheng et al., 2012; 22684742), glioma (Chen et al., 2013; 23138393, Tu et al., 2012; 22374425), and other solid tumors (Li and Zhao, 2013; 23079712, Xia et al., 2005; 15930280, Alam et al., 2009; 19356789, Ozg\u00fcr et al., 2011; 19272799, Li et al., 2014; 25148033, Pierscianek et al., 2017; 27388534, Pierscianek et al., 2016; 26951238, Becerikli et al., 2015; 25274141, Xia et al., 2005; 15958611). In several of these studies, increased EPHB4 expression has been associated with clinicopathologic features, including disease stage (Sinha et al., 2006; 17043250, Li and Zhao, 2013; 23079712, Wu et al., 2004; 15029258, Alam et al., 2008; 18231102, Kumar et al., 2007; 17353927, Alam et al., 2009; 19356789, Zheng et al., 2012; 22684742, Li et al., 2014; 25148033), histological grade (Hasina et al., 2013; 23100466, Wu et al., 2004; 15029258, Takai et al., 2001; 11295082, Tu et al., 2012; 22374425), and hormone receptor status (Huang et al., 2015; 26191333, Dong et al., 2017; 28454369). High EPHB4 expression has been associated with inferior survival in multivariate analyses for patients with CRC treated with bevacizumab [hazard ratio (HR) = 5.95] (Guijarro_Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2013; 23579861), HNSCC (HR = 2.95) (Yavrouian et al., 2008; 18794445), epithelial ovarian cancer (HR = 4.53) (Pradeep et al., 2015; 26481148), or glioma (HR = 3.21) (Tu et al., 2012; 22374425). There are no approved therapies available to target EPHB4 alterations in cancer. sEPHB4 is a soluble monomeric extracellular domain of EPHB4 that functions as an antagonist of EphrinB2_EPHB4 interaction (Kertesz et al., 2006; 16322467), and fusion of sEPHB4 with human serum albumin (HSA) increases its stability (Shi et al., 2012; 22411527). Recombinant sEPHB4_HSA is under investigation in clinical trials. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that sEPHB4_HSA inhibits cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth, including for cells expressing cancer_associated EPHB4 mutants or overexpressing wild_type EPHB4 (Kertesz et al., 2006; 16322467, Li et al., 2014; 25148033, Liu et al., 2013; 23721559, Bhatia et al., 2016; 27941840, Scehnet et al., 2009; 18836096, Ferguson et al., 2015; 26073592). In addition, small_molecule inhibitors targeting multiple tyrosine kinases including EPHB4, such as JI_101 and XL647, have been under preclinical and clinical investigation (Werner et al., 2015; 26365907, Pietanza et al., 2012; 22011666, Pietanza et al., 2012; 22722787).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "FGF19", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "FGF19 encodes fibroblast growth factor 19, an FGFR4 ligand involved with bile acid synthesis and hepatocyte proliferation in the liver (Xie et al., 1999; 10525310, Hagel et al., 2015; 25776529). FGF19 lies in a region of chromosome 11q13 that also contains FGF3, FGF4, and CCND1; this region is frequently amplified in a diverse range of malignancies (Katoh et al., 2002; 12429977). Correlation between FGF19 amplification and protein expression has been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)(Kan et al., 2013; 23788652), lung squamous cell carcinoma (Li et al., 2020; 32111983, Caruso et al., 2019; 31063779), and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)(Gao et al., 2019; 30518874), but was not observed in other cancers (Sawey et al., 2011; 21397858, Kanzaki et al., 2021; 33674622). For patients with solid tumors, FGF19 amplification has been reported most frequently in breast cancer (17%), head and neck cancer (12%), lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC; 12%), and urothelial carcinoma cancer (11%)(cBio_Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359, cBio_Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2012; 22960745, cBio_Robertson et al., 2017; 28988769). FGF19 mutations are rare in solid tumors (cBio_Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359). FGF19 expression or amplification has been associated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)(Miura et al., 2012; 22309595, Kang et al., 2019; 30815392), and in prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy (Nagamatsu et al., 2015; 25854696). Studies suggest FGF19 expression may also be a poor prognostic indicator in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)(Gao et al., 2019; 30518874) and lung SCC (Li et al., 2020; 32111983). A Phase 1 study of the FGFR4 inhibitor fisogatinib (BLU_554) for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) reported a 17% ORR (11/66, 1 CR, ongoing for >1.5 years) and 3.3_month PFS for FGF19 IHC\u2013positive patients; patients with negative or unknown FGF19 IHC scores experienced poorer outcomes (0% ORR, 2.3_month PFS)(Kim et al., 2019; 31575541). A Phase 1/2 study evaluating another FGFR4 inhibitor, FGF401, demonstrated an ORR of 7.5% (4/53) and SD rate of 53% (28/53) for patients with HCC (Chan et al., 2017; AACR Abstract CT106). A Phase 1 study of the FGFR4 inhibitor H3B_6527 reported a 17% ORR (OS of 10.3 months, 46% clinical benefit rate) among patients with HCC; enrollment of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) was suspended due to efficacy (Macarulla et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4090). A retrospective analysis reported that 50% (2/4) of patients with HCC harboring FGF19 amplification experienced a CR to sorafenib (Kaibori et al., 2016; 27384874), though another retrospective study found patients with higher pretreatment serum levels of FGF19 experienced reduced benefit from sorafenib compared with those with lower serum FGF19 (PFS of 86 vs. 139 days, OS of 353 vs. 494 days); no difference was observed for lenvatinib (Kanzaki et al., 2021; 33674622). A patient with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with 11q13 (FGF3, FGF4, FGF19) and 12p13 (FGF6 and FGF23) amplification experienced a CR lasting 9 months from a pan_FGFR inhibitor (Dumbrava et al., 2018; 31123723).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "FGF3", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "FGF3 encodes fibroblast growth factor 3, a growth factor that plays a central role in development of the inner ear.

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942).

MSI_high (MSI_H) has been observed at high frequency in endometrial cancers (14_33%)(Santin et al., ASCO 2016; Abstract 414, Zighelboim et al., 2007; 17513808, Hampel et al., 2006; 16885385, Stelloo et al., 2016; 27006490, Kanopiene et al., 2014; 25458958, Black et al., 2006; 16549821, Nout et al., 2012; 22609107, Steinbakk et al., 2011; 21547578, Bilbao et al., 2010; 20005452), colorectal cancers (CRCs; 10_15%)(Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), and gastric cancers (12_35%)(Hiyama et al., 2004; 15209621, Wu et al., 1998; 9537253, dos Santos et al., 1996; 8536886, Fang et al., 2013; 23555086) and at lower frequencies in many other tumor types, including esophageal (Hall et al., 2016; ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancer Symposium Abstract 528, Farris et al., 2011; 21422910), small bowel (Gingras et al., 2015; AACR Pancreatic Cancer Abstract PR06, Agaramet al., 2010; 20395525, Ruemmele et al., 2009; 19252434, Planck et al., 2003; 12627520, Hibi et al., 1995; 7775257, Muneyuki et al., 2000; 11117578), hepatobiliary (Zhang et al., 2005; 15918185, Chiappini et al., 2004; 14656944, Suto et al., 2001; 11223838, Momoi et al., 2001; 11580146, Liengswangwong et al., 2003; 14506736, Moy et al., 2015; 25680569, Yoshida et al., 2000; 11063221), prostate (Cheng et al., 2016; Genitourinary Cancers Symposium Abstract 251, Pritchard et al., 2014; 25255306, Azzouzi et al., 2007; 17233803, Burger et al., 2006; 16924473), and urinary tract carcinomas (Harper et al., 2015; USCAP Abstract 905, Bai et al., 2013; 23690119, Giedl et al., 2014; 25319978, Yamamoto et al., 2006; 16675567). In one study, MSI_H status was associated with a positive prognostic effect in patients with gastric cancer treated with surgery alone and a negative predictive effect in patients treated with chemotherapy (Smyth et al., 2015; ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium Abstract 62). Data regarding the role of MSI_H on prognosis and survival in endometrial cancer are conflicting (Zighelboim et al., 2007; 17513808, Kanopiene et al., 2014; 25458958, Bilbao_Sieyro et al., 2014; 25026289, Mackay et al., 2010; 20304627, Steinbakk et al., 2011; 21547578, Arabi et al., 2009; 19275958, Black et al., 2006; 16549821). However, studies specifically analyzing early stage endometrial cancer have reported a correlation between MSI_H and decreased survival (Stelloo et al., 2016; 27006490, Mackay et al., 2010; 20304627, Nout et al., 2012; 22609107, Bilbao et al., 2010; 20005452), thereby suggesting that MSI_H predicts for poor prognosis in this subset of endometrial tumors. On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "NOTCH1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "P1443fs*36", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "P1443fs*36"}}, "Interpretation": "NOTCH1 encodes a member of the NOTCH family of receptors, which are involved in cell fate determination and various developmental processes. Depending on cellular context, NOTCH1 can act as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene (Wang et al., 2011; 22006338, Klinakis et al., 2011; 21562564). Upon binding of membrane_bound ligands, the NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD) is cleaved and forms part of a transcription factor complex that regulates downstream target genes involved in cell fate determination, proliferation, and apoptosis (Penton et al., 2012; 22306179, Kopan and Ilagan, 2009; 19379690). NOTCH1 alterations that disrupt ligand binding (Andrawes et al., 2013; 23839946, Rebay et al., 1991; 1657403, Ge et al., 2008; 18445292) or remove the transmembrane domain (amino acids 1736_1756), RAM domain (amino acids 1757_1926), ankyrin repeats (amino acids 1927_2122) and/or transactivation domain (amino acids 2123_2374) that are necessary for NOTCH1 function, such as observed here, are predicted to be inactivating (Aster et al., 2000; 11003647, Weng et al., 2004; 15472075, Kopan and Ilagan, 2009; 19379690, Deregowski et al., 2006; 16869730). Several point mutations, including D469G, A465T, C478F, R1594Q, and P1770S, have also been reported to inactivate NOTCH1 (Wang et al., 2011; 22006338, Uchibori et al., 2017; 28791383, Liu et al., 2013; 24277854). NOTCH1 mutation has been reported in 13% (4/30) of upper aerodigestive tract adenocarcinoma cases (COSMIC, Mar 2021)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Studies have reported NOTCH1 mutations in 15_26% of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) analyzed, suggesting that NOTCH1 acts as a tumor suppressor in HNSCC (cBio_Agrawal et al., 2011; 21798897, cBio_Stransky et al., 2011; 21798893). NOTCH1 mutations have been reported in 3% of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and 22% (2/9) of sinonasal adenocarcinomas analyzed in COSMIC (Aug 2021)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of NOTCH1 alterations in head and neck adenocarcinoma are limited (PubMed, Mar 2021). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of NOTCH1 alteration in head and neck carcinomas outside of the context of HNSCC are limited (PubMed, Aug 2021). NOTCH1 inhibitors and gamma_secretase inhibitors (GSIs) may be potential therapeutic approaches in the case of NOTCH1 activating mutations (Debeb et al., 2012; 22547109, Fouladi et al., 2011; 21825264, Groth and Fortini, 2012; 22309842, Kamstrup et al., 2010; 20538790, Kridel et al., 2012; 22210878, Krop et al., 2012; 22547604, Rosati et al., 2013; 23001755, Samon et al., 2012; 22504949, Lehal et al., 2020; 32601208, Lopez_Miranda et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3020). In a Phase 2 study, the GSI AL101 (BMS_906024) elicited PRs in 15% (6/39) and SDs in 54% (21/39) of patients with metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) harboring NOTCH activating alterations (Ferrarotto et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 919MO). Additional responses to AL101 have been reported in a patient with gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma harboring multiple NOTCH1 mutations, a patient with T_cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T_ALL) harboring a NOTCH1 HD domain mutation, and a patient with ACC harboring a single NOTCH1 mutation (El_Khoueiry et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 2515, Knoechel et al., 2015; 27148573). A Phase 1 study of the pan_NOTCH inhibitor CB_103 for patients with advanced or recurrent solid tumors reported a preliminary mPFS of 21.7 weeks for patients with ACC, with 2 patients harboring NOTCH1_mutated ACC demonstrating SD > 6 months as best response (Lopez_Miranda et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3020). On the basis of clinical data in non_Hodgkin lymphoma, NOTCH1 activating alterations may be associated with sensitivity to the approved PI3K inhibitor copanlisib (Dreyling et al., 2017; 28633365); this is further supported by limited preclinical data that suggest that NOTCH1 may be a negative regulator of PTEN (Palomero et al., 2007; 17873882, Liu et al., 2013; 21993533). Two of 3 patients with advanced solid tumors and concurrent alterations in CCND1/3 and NOTCH1, as seen here, achieved prolonged SD on palbociclib in the exploratory analysis of NCI_MATCH (Clark et al., 2019; AACR Abstract LB_010/2). While activating mutations may be targeted via gamma_secretase inhibitors or PI3K inhibitors, there are no therapies available to address NOTCH1 inactivation, as seen here.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "R273H", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "R273H"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). Mutations of TP53 have been reported in 36_51% of head and neck carcinomas, across numerous subtypes including in 40% of adenocarcinomas (Bolt et al., 2005; 16139561, Yamazaki et al., 2003; 12509970, McBride et al., 2013; 23852799, Pickering et al., 2013; 23619168). In one study of 78 patients with undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma, p53 protein expression was associated with worse disease_free survival (Ma et al., 2003; 12966511). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may also be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as APR_246 (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571, Lehmann et al., 2012; 22965953, Mohell et al., 2015; 26086967, Franssonet al., 2016; 27179933). In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, APR_246 combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true",
