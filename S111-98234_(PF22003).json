TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a bTMB level that may be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). NSCLC harbors a median bTMB of 16.8 Muts/Mb (range 1.9_52.5 Muts/Mb)(Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950). Retrospective analysis of the Phase 3 OAK and Phase 2 POPLAR trials for patients with advanced or metastatic non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) reported that bTMB \u22657 Muts/Mb was associated with shorter PFS (2.8 vs. 4.2 months) and OS (7.4 vs. 11.9 months) compared with bTMB <7 Muts/Mb for patients treated with docetaxel (Nie et al., 2020; 32380463). In one study of advanced NSCLC in China, bTMB \u22656 Muts/Mb was associated with decreased PFS (10 vs. 18 months) and OS (11 vs. 25 months) compared with bTMB <6 Muts/Mb for patients treated with platinum_based chemotherapy (Ma et al., 2021; 34055609). A large study of Chinese patients with lung adenocarcinoma reported a shorter median OS for tumors with a higher number of mutations in a limited gene set compared with a lower mutation number (48.4 vs. 61.0 months)(Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843). Another study of patients with NSCLC correlated elevated TMB with poorer prognosis and significantly associated lower TMB in combination with PD_L1 negative status with longer median survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). However, no significant prognostic association of TMB and/or PD_L1 status with survival has been reported in patients with lung SCC (Yu et al., 2019; 30253973, Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). On the basis of clinical evidence in NSCLC and HSNCC, increased bTMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511) and anti_PD_1 (Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074) therapies. In NSCLC, multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 to 16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). In HNSCC, a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Increased tumor mutational burden may predict response to anti_PD_1 (alone or in combination with anti_CTLA_4) or anti_PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Nivolumab", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Nivolumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD_1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD_L1 and PD_L2, reducing inhibition of the antitumor immune response.

In advanced squamous NSCLC, second_line nivolumab resulted in longer mOS (9.2 vs. 6.0 months) and higher ORR (20% vs. 9%) than docetaxel in the Phase 3 CheckMate 017 study; PD_L1 expression was neither prognostic nor predictive of nivolumab efficacy (Brahmer et al., 2015; 26028407, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25704439). Pooled analysis of CheckMate 057 and CheckMate 017 showed improved long_term OS and PFS benefit for nivolumab over docetaxel, with 5_year OS rates of 13% versus 2.6% (HR=0.68) and PFS rates of 8.0% versus 0% (HR=0.79)(Lind et al., 2020; BTOG Abstract 113).

The superiority of pembrolizumab over platinum chemotherapy as first_line treatment for patients with PD_L1_positive non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lacking EGFR or ALK alterations was demonstrated in the Phase 3 KEYNOTE_042 and _024 studies, which reported improved median OS (mOS) for PD_L1 tumor proportion scores (TPS) \u22651% (16.7 vs. 12.1 months, HR=0.81) (Mok et al., 2019; 30955977) and \u226550% (26.3 vs. 13.4 months, HR=0.62_0.69) (Brahmer et al., 2020; ESMO LBA51), with estimated 5_year OS rates of 32% versus 16% in the KEYNOTE_024 study (Brahmer et al., 2020; ESMO LBA51). In the Phase 1b KEYNOTE_100 study of pembrolizumab, mOS was numerically higher for patients with NSCLC and PD_L1 TPS \u226550% relative to those with lower levels of PD_L1 expression in both the first_line (35.4 vs. 19.5 months) and previously treated (15.4 vs. 8.5 months) settings (Garon et al., 2019; 31154919). A retrospective study showed that among patients with NSCLC and high PD_L1 expression treated with first_line pembrolizumab, mOS was improved for patients with TPS of 90_100% relative to those with TPS of 50_89% (not reached vs. 15.9 months, HR=0.39) (Aguilar et al., 2019; 31435660). Phase 3 studies showed that the addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy alone in the first_line setting for patients with either non_squamous (KEYNOTE_189) (Gadgeel et al., 2020; 32150489) or squamous (KEYNOTE_407) (Paz_Ares et al., 2018; 30280635, Paz_Ares et al., 2020; 32599071) NSCLC, regardless of PD_L1 or tumor mutational burden (TMB) status (Paz_Ares et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA80). An exploratory analysis of KEYNOTE_189 demonstrated the superiority of the pembrolizumab combination therapy, regardless of blood TMB (bTMB) status (Garassino et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 9521). For the first_line treatment of patients with NSCLC and high PD_L1 expression (TPS \u226550%), a meta_analysis of KEYNOTE_024 and _189 reported the combination of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy to be non_superior to pembrolizumab alone in terms of survival benefit; however, the combination did increase ORR (+22%, p=0.011) (Doherty et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P1.01_16). In the Phase 2/3 KEYNOTE_010 study, pembrolizumab extended mOS relative to docetaxel (10.4_12.7 vs. 8.2 months) for patients with previously treated PD_L1_positive NSCLC (Herbst et al., 2016; 26712084). Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of pembrolizumab, both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy, to treat patients with NSCLC and brain metastases (Powell et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 1483PD, Mansfield et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 1482O, Goldberg et al., 2016; 27267608).

In the first_line setting, the Phase 3 IMpower130, IMpower150, and IMpower132 studies have shown that the addition of atezolizumab to chemotherapy_based regimens significantly improves survival for patients with non_squamous NSCLC without EGFR or ALK alterations (Socinski et al., 2018; 29863955, West et al., 2019; 31122901, Barlesi et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract LBA54).

In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). EGFR L858 is located in the kinase domain and is encoded by exon 21. EGFR L858R has been characterized as activating (Lynch et al., 2004; 15118073, Paez et al., 2004; 15118125, Pao et al., 2004; 15329413) and patients with the L858R mutation have been shown to be sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as erlotinib, gefitinib (Lynch et al., 2004; 15118073, Paez et al., 2004; 15118125, Pao et al., 2004; 15329413), and afatinib (Yang et al., 2015; 25589191). EGFR mutation has been reported in 12_36% of lung adenocarcinomas (Vallee et al., 2013; 23934203, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552) and in 4% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745). EGFR protein expression/overexpression has been reported in up to 70% of NSCLC cases (Watzka et al., 2010; 20353893, Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Grob et al., 2013; 23238037, Park et al., 2012; 22207554, Dobashi et al., 2011; 21040950, Ludovini et al., 2013; 23314677). In addition, expression of EGFR protein has been shown to be higher in lung squamous cell carcinoma samples as compared to lung adenocarcinoma (Skrzypski et al., 2013; 23870818, Kim et al., 2012; 22419022). In patients with lung adenocarcinoma, EGFR mutation was a predictor of poor overall survival (Lee et al., 2013; 23525704, Oakley and Chiosea, 2011; 21587084). However, EGFR mutations have been reported to predict improved survival in patients with resected Stage 1_3 lung adenocarcinoma (Marks et al., 2008; 18303429) or resected Stage 1 NSCLC (Izar et al., 2013; 23932319). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer, EGFR activating mutations may predict sensitivity to EGFR TKIs, including erlotinib (Rosell et al., 2011; 22285168), gefitinib (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064), afatinib (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960), dacomitinib (Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), and osimertinib (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549); however, the data for patients with other tumor types are limited (Hong et al., 2020; 32749686, Kim et al., 2015; 26462025, Kim et al., 2015; 25424851, Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840, Cavalieri et al., 2018; 29734047, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Audet et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 6041). The Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study of amivantamab monotherapy or in combination with lazertinib for the treatment of EGFR_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has produced encouraging preliminary results for treatment_naive patients and patients who relapsed after treatment with osimertinib with and without chemotherapy, including osimertinib_relapsed patients with biomarkers indicating EGFR/MET_based osimertinib resistance (Leighl et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 1192MO, Cho et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 1258O, Bauml et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9006, Shu et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 1193MO). In a Phase 1 trial, the HER3_targeted antibody patritumab deruxtecan elicited an ORR of 39% (22/57, 1 CR) and a median PFS of 8.2 months for patients with non_small cell lung cancer previously treated with an EGFR TKI, many of whom displayed TKI resistance alterations (Janne et al., 2022; 34548309). A Phase 1 trial evaluating the EGFR inhibitor AZD3759 reported a reduction in the volume of brain metastases in 40% (8/20) of patients with previously treated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring either the EGFR L858R alteration or EGFR exon 19 deletion, including 3 confirmed PRs and 3 unconfirmed PRs (Ahn et al., 2017; 29056570, Yang et al., 2016; 27928026).

In the maintenance setting, the placebo_controlled Phase 3 SATURN trial reported significantly improved PFS with maintenance erlotinib following first_line platinum_based chemotherapy irrespective of EGFR status; however, the largest effect was seen for patients with EGFR mutations (HR=0.10)(Cappuzzo et al., 2010; 20493771). In the neoadjuvant setting, a Phase 2 trial reported a numerically improved ORR and significantly longer PFS with erlotinib compared with chemotherapy for patients with advanced EGFR_mutated NSCLC (Zhong et al., 2019; 31194613). In the placebo_controlled Phase 3 RELAY trial, the addition of ramucirumab to erlotinib improved PFS for previously untreated patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR L858R or exon 19 deletion (19.4 vs. 12.4 months, HR=0.59)(Nakagawa et al., 2019; 31591063). In a Phase 2 trial, no clinical benefit was observed from the addition of bevacizumab to erlotinib for patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation (Stinchcombe et al., 2019; 31393548).

A Phase 2b study of first_line afatinib compared with gefitinib, also for NSCLC with exon 19 deletions or L858R, reported similar median OS for the two therapies (27.9 vs. 24.5 months, HR=0.86) but significantly longer time_to_treatment_failure (13.7 vs. 11.5 months, HR=0.75) and higher ORR (73% vs. 56%, p=0.0018) with afatinib (Paz_Ares et al., 2017; 28426106). Patients with metastatic NSCLC and common EGFR mutations who progressed on prior chemotherapy experienced an ORR of 50.0% (30/60) from afatinib in a Phase 4 trial (Thongprasert et al., 2019; 31807143). As first_line therapy for NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletions or L858R, prospective or randomized Phase 2 trials have reported a median PFS of 10.2 months and OS of 24.8 months for patients unfit for chemotherapy (Januszewski et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.13_17) and an ORR of 72.5% (n=40, 1 CR), DCR of 100% (40/40), and median PFS and OS of 15.2 and 30.0 months, respectively, for elderly patients \u226570 years old (Suzuki et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_92). A retrospective study of afatinib administered to Asian patients with NSCLC, 99% of whom were previously treated with erlotinib and/or gefitinib, reported an ORR of 27.4% (63/230) for patients with common sensitizing EGFR mutations and an ORR of 24.4% (105/431) for the entire cohort (Chang et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_11).

CREBBP mutations have been observed at high frequency in follicular lymphoma (FL, 26%) and diffuse large B_cell lymphoma (DLBCL, 16%), and at lower frequency in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, 7%), and tumors of the urinary tract (15%), skin (12%), liver (9%), stomach (9%), and endometrium (8%)(COSMIC, 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). These mutations include missense substitutions clustered in the CREBBP histone acetyltransferase domain and truncating mutations throughout the gene sequence, suggesting a role for CREBBP inactivation in these diseases. CREBBP mutations have been reported to occur in the transition from prostate acinar carcinoma to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (Grasso et al., 2015; 25735316), which may indicate significance for CREBBP in SCC. In two cases of relapsed pediatric B_cell ALL, CREBBP mutation conferred resistance to glucocorticoid therapy (Ma et al., 2015; 25790293). Reports have found CREBBP mutation in 62_68% of patients with FL (Green et al., 2015; 25713363, Loeffler et al., 2015; 25027518), which was associated with immune evasion (Green et al., 2015; 25713363). AML with MYST3/CREBBP fusion was reported to occur in 60_80% of cases 9_72 months after adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer and was associated with a poor prognosis (Gervais et al., 2008; 18528428, Haferlach et al., 2009; 19194466). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in CREBBP. The use of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are being investigated in clinical trials that are recruiting patients with either lymphoma or urothelial carcinoma harboring CREBBP alterations. However, it has been reported that there is no correlation between CREBBP mutation status and response to HDAC inhibitors in DLBCL (Mensah et al., 2015; 25671298).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "MSH6", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "S321*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "S321*"}}, "Interpretation": "MSH6 encodes MutS homolog 6 protein, a member of the mismatch repair (MMR) gene family. Defective MMR occurring as a result of mutation(s) in the MMR family (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2) can result in microsatellite instability (MSI), common in colon, endometrium, and stomach cancers (You et al., 2010; 21081928). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt MSH6 function or expression (Li et al., 2013; 23622243, Wu et al., 2011; 21720545, Edelbrock et al., 2013; 23391514, Berends et al., 2002; 11709755, Warren et al., 2007; 17531815, Geng et al., 2012; 22277660). MSH6 mutation has been observed in 1.3% of lung adenocarcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552) and in 2% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745). Although mutations in genes that serve to maintain genomic stability are generally found at low frequencies in sporadic cancers, mutations in MSH6 and DNA repair gene PRKDC have been identified in lung adenocarcinomas, and mutation rates were suggested to be influenced by defects in DNA repair genes (but not MSH6 specifically) (Ding et al., 2008; 18948947, Negrini et al., 2010; 20177397). Reports on the role of MSH6 mutations in prognosis have been conflicting. One study reported a correlation between reduced MMR gene mRNA and increased lymph node metastasis in patients with lung cancer, while other studies reported that MSH6 mutations may be a marker for MSI and may be associated with better prognosis in patients with certain tumor types (Johannsdottir et al., 1999; 10470121, de la Chapelle and Hampel, 2010; 20516444, Popat et al., 2005; 15659508, Chen et al., 2000; 20937204). Numerous studies in various cancer types have shown that MSH6 loss or inactivation is associated with MSI and increased mutation burden (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, You et al., 2010; 21081928, Joly et al., 2015; 25504677, Pritchard et al., 2014; 25255306, Rosty et al., 2014; 25117503, McConechy et al., 2015; 25636458). Clinical studies have shown that MSI is associated with patient responses to anti_programmed death 1 (PD_1) immune checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab (Le et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract LBA100)(Le et al., 2015; 26028255) and nivolumab (Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436). Higher mutation burden was also reported to be associated with response to pembrolizumab (Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070). Furthermore, MSI status correlates with higher PD_1 and PD_L1 expression (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179), potential biomarkers of response to PD_1 targeted immunotherapies. Therefore, inactivation of MSH6 may confer sensitivity to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors. Germline mutations in MSH6 are associated with both \"typical\" and \"atypical\" forms of autosomal dominant Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC), which accounts for 1_7% of all colorectal cancers (Silva et al., 2009; 19466295). Approximately 10% of all Lynch syndrome_associated mutations have been attributed to alterations in MSH6 (Peltomaki, 2005; 16083711). Carriers of mutations in MSH6 have a 60_80% risk of colorectal cancer (Kastrinos and Syngal, 2007; 17920897). Lynch syndrome has an estimated prevalence in the general population ranging from 1:600 to 1:2000 (Silva et al., 2009; 19466295, Sehgal et al., 2014; 24978665, de la Chapelle et al., 2005; 16136383). Biallelic germline mutation of MSH6 has been shown to account for 20% of cases of the very rare syndrome Constitutional Mismatch Repair Deficiency (CMMRD), which is characterized by a 95% incidence rate of childhood onset lymphoma, leukemia and brain tumors, followed by early_onset colorectal cancer (reviewed in Wimmer et al., 2008; 18709565, Wimmer et al., 2014; 24737826, Scott et al., 2007; 17259933, Ripperger et al., 2010; 20015892, Baris et al., 2016; 26544533). Given the association between MSH6 and these inherited syndromes, in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of MSH6 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Cannot Be Determined", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Cannot Be Determined"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI_H is generally infrequent in NSCLC, reported in fewer than 1% of samples across several large studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197, Ninomiya et al., 2006; 16641899, Vanderwalde et al., 2018; 29436178, Zang et al., 2019; 31270941, Dudley et al., 2016; 26880610, Takamochi et al., 2017; 28676214, Schrock et al., 2017; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2016.11.487), whereas data on the reported incidence of MSI_H in SCLC has been limited and conflicting (Pylkkanen et al., 1997; 9329646, Gonzalez et al., 2000; 11061602, Chen et al., 1996; 8782463, Merlo et al., 1994; 8174113). One study reported MSI_H in lung adenocarcinoma patients with smoking history, and 3 of 4 MSI_H patients examined also had metachronous carcinomas in other organs, although this has not been investigated in large scale studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of MSI in NSCLC are limited (PubMed, Oct 2021). On the basis of prospective clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD_1_targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143) and PD_L1_targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92).

NRF2 activity is antagonized by KEAP1, which binds NRF2 to promote its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (Kobayashi et al., 2004; 15282312). NRF2 missense mutations tend to cluster within the KEAP1 binding domain (especially amino acids 21_36 and 74_86); these mutations prevent degradation and lead to high levels of NRF2 protein and constitutive expression of NRF2 target genes (Shibata et al., 2008; 18757741). These mutations are considered activating. NFE2L2 alterations have been reported in several cancer types, including tumors affecting the head and neck (13_25%), lung (4_11%), esophagus (11%), or skin (6%)(Kim et al., 2010; 19967722, Shibata et al., 2008; 18757741, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014; 25079552). In the context of lung cancer, NFE2L2 mutations are most prevalent in smokers and patients with squamous cell carcinomas (SCC); NFE2L2 mutations also correlate with poor survival in multivariate analysis (mean survival 55 months vs. 81 months) (Shibata et al.,2008; 18757741; Sasaki et al., 2013; 23545629). NRF2 protein expression correlates with poor patient prognosis in lung cancer (Yang et al., 2011; 21663859), colorectal cancer (Ji et al., 2014; 24695690), gastric cancer (Hu et al., 2013; 24175806, Kawasaki et al., 2015; 25588809), esophageal SCC (Kawasaki et al., 2014; 24599410), and osteosarcoma (Park et al., 2012; 23172081), among others. Additionally, cancers with increased NRF2 activity show increased resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Wang et al., 2008; 18413364, Kawasaki et al., 2014; 24599410, Hu et al., 2013; 24175806, Kawasaki et al., 2015; 25588809). A study of patients with localized non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) identified pathogenic KEAP1 and NFE2L2 mutations as predictors of local recurrence following radiotherapy but not surgery; limited preclinical data also showed that treatment with a glutaminase inhibitor sensitized KEAP1_mutated NSCLC cells to radiation (Binkley et al., 2020; 33071215). In other preclinical studies, treatment with AKT inhibitors sensitized lung cancer cells harboring KEAP1 or NFE2L2 mutations to both chemotherapy and radiation therapy (Chowdhry et al., 2013; 22964642, Abazeed et al., 2013; 23980093). There are no approved therapies that directly target NFE2L2 alterations; however, activating alterations in NFE2L2 may indicate sensitivity to mTORC1/2 inhibitors (Paik et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9085, Shibata et al., 2010; 21062981, Bendavit et al., 2016; 27784786). A Phase 2 study of the mTORC1/2 inhibitor sapanisertib for patients with advanced or recurrent lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) reported a 29% (2/7) ORR and a 100% (7/7) DCR for patients with NFE2L2 alterations (Paik et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9085).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "RBM10", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "A184fs*80", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "A184fs*80"}}, "Interpretation": "RBM10 encodes RNA binding motif protein 10, a nuclear RNA_binding protein involved in the regulation of alternative splicing (Wang et al., 2013; 24000153, Inoue et al., 2014; 24530524). Germline mutations in RBM10 cause TARP syndrome, an X_linked recessive disorder characterized by development of micrognathia, glossoptosis, and cleft palate (Johnston et al., 2010; 20451169, Gripp et al., 2011; 21910224). Recurrent somatic mutations in RBM10 have been identified in breast, colorectal, ovarian, pancreatic, lung, and prostate cancers and in <1.0% of hematopoietic and lymphoid samples analyzed in COSMIC (Jul 2021)(Sj\u00f6blom et al., 2006; 16959974, Kan et al., 2010; 20668451, Furukawa et al., 2011; 22355676, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). In breast cancer, RBM10 expression, as well as the other RBM genes on the X chromosome, RBMX and RBM3, has been shown to be correlated with expression of both caspase_3 and the pro_apoptotic gene BAX, leading the authors to hypothesize that RBM10 may play a role in apoptosis in breast cancer (Mart\u00ednez_Arribas et al., 2006; 16552754, Mart\u00edn_Garabato et al., 2008; 18820371).

TP53 is one of the most commonly mutated genes in lung cancer; mutations have been reported in 43_80% of non_small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745, Mogi and Kuwano, 2011; 21331359, Tekpli et al., 2013; 23011884, Vignot et al., 2013; 23630207, Maeng et al., 2013; 24222160, Cortot et al., 2014; 24169260, Itakura et al., 2013; 23922113), including 42_52% of lung adenocarcinomas and 58_83% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (cBioPortal, COSMIC, Feb 2021)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, cBio_Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745, Kim et al., 2014; 24323028). TP53 homozygous deletion has been observed in 1.4% of lung adenocarcinoma and <1% of lung squamous cell carcinoma cases (cBioPortal, Feb 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). In one study of 55 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, TP53 alterations correlated with immunogenic features including PD_L1 expression, tumor mutation burden and neoantigen presentation; likely as a consequence of this association TP53 mutations correlated with improved clinical outcomes to PD_1 inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab in this study (Dong et al., 2016; 28039262). Mutations in TP53 have been associated with lymph node metastasis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (Seo et al., 2012; 22975805). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Fraction", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor fraction provides an estimate of the percentage of ctDNA present in a cell_free DNA (cfDNA) sample. The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with elevated tumor fraction have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus high sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at low risk of false negative results. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels. In the research setting, changes in tumor fraction estimates have been associated with treatment duration and clinical response and may be a useful indicator for future cancer management (Bronkhorst et al., 2019; 30923679, Raja et al., 2018; 30093454, Hrebien et al., 2019; 30860573, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5039, Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Goodall et al., 2017; 28450425,
