These kinases function downstream of RAS as part of the MAPK (RAF_MEK_ERK) signaling cascade that facilitates cell proliferation, survival and transformation (Holderfield et al., 2014; 24957944, Burotto et al., 2014; 24948110). BRAF mutations have been reported in up to 20% of all cancers, with the majority of mutations occurring at the V600 position (Davies et al., 2002; 12068308, Kandoth et al., 2013; 24132290). BRAF amplification has been reported and correlated with overexpression of the BRAF protein in various tumor types (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tanami et al., 2004; 15467732, Modrek et al., 2009; 19671679, Ciampi et al., 2005; 16199894). Among the V600 mutations, V600E accounts for 70_80% of observations, V600K for 10_30%, and V600R for 5_7%, with V600D comprising the majority of the rest (Davies et al., 2002; 12068308, Greaves et al., 2013; 23273605, Klein et al., 2013; 23237741). Mutations at V600 have been shown to constitutively activate BRAF kinase and hyperactivate the downstream MEK_ERK signaling, promoting oncogenic transformation (Wellbrock et al., 2004; 15059882, Davies et al., 2002; 12068308). In multiple cancer types, multiple mutations at V600, including V600E, V600K, V600R, V600D, and V600M exhibited sensitivity to V600_targeted therapies (Hauschild et al., 2012; 22735384, McArthur et al., 2014; 24508103, Fisher et al., 2012; 22904646, Yang et al., 2010; 20551065, Gentilcore et al., 2013; 23317446, Klein et al., 2013; 23237741, van den Brom et al., 2013; 23473613, Klein et al., 2013; 23490649, Ponti et al., 2013; 23463675, Ponti et al., 2012; 23031422, Parakh et al., 2015; 25382067, Lee et al., 2017; 28194436); other mutations at this position are predicted to behave similarly. BRAF mutations have been reported in approximately 5_19% of colorectal cancer samples (De Roock et al., 2011; 21163703, Di Nicolantonio et al., 2008; 19001320, Dienstmann et al., 2012; 22723336, Safaee et al., 2012; 23056577, Guedes et al., 2013; 23548132). BRAF V600E is a strong adverse prognostic marker in colorectal cancer (NCCN Colon Cancer Guidelines, v2.2021). BRAF mutations have been associated with poor prognosis and shorter survival in patients with colorectal cancer, particularly those with metastatic disease, as well as with smoking history (Sinicrope et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract 3514, Hassabo et al., 2014; ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium Abstract 473) (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Bokemeyer et al., 2012; 22446022, Gavin et al., 2012; 23045248, Laurent_Puig et al., 2009; 19884556, Ogino et al., 2012; 22147942, Roth et al., 2010; 20008640, Douillard et al., 2013; 24024839, Hsu et al., 2016; 26989027). Analysis of individual BRAF mutations in 2127 patients with advanced colorectal cancer treated with chemotherapy with or without cetuximab revealed that BRAF V600E associated with poor prognosis (HR 2.60, P=1.0e_15, with median reduction of survival being 320 days) and distinct clinicopathological features, including correlation with increased peritoneal metastases compared to BRAF wild_type tumors (24% vs. 12%, P=0.0015), while BRAF D594G inactivating mutation was not prognostic (HR 1.30, P=0.37) and had similar clinicopathologic features as BRAF wild_type tumors (Summers et al., 2016; 27815357). Significant benefit for patients with BRAF V600_mutated colorectal cancers (CRC) has been achieved with combinatorial approaches involving BRAF inhibitors, EGF_targeting antibodies, and MEK inhibitors (Kopetz et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 4001, Corcoran et al., 2018; 29431699, Hyman et al., 2015; 26287849, Yaeger et al., 2015; 25589621, Kopetz et al., 2020; 33356422). In a Phase 3 study for patients with metastatic CRC on second_ or third_line treatments, doublet therapy with the RAF inhibitor encorafenib and the EGFR antibody cetuximab showed superior mOS to cetuximab plus chemotherapy (9.3 vs. 5.9 months, HR=0.61, n=220 and n=221), and similar benefit was seen for a triplet therapy cohort adding the MEK inhibitor binimetinib (OS of 9.3 months, n=224) (Kopetz et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 4001). Combinations of other RAF inhibitors such as dabrafenib or vemurafenib with EGFR antibodies such as panitumumab have also resulted in clinical benefit for similar patient populations in Phase 1 and 2 studies. A trial of dabrafenib and panitumumab with or without the MEK inhibitor trametinib reported a 21% ORR and 86% DCR (n=91) for the triplet combination and a 10% ORR and 90% DCR (n=20) for the doublet therapy (Corcoran et al., 2018; 29431699). Multiple similar studies of vemurafenib with panitumumab or cetuximab doublet therapy have also reported a benefit (Hyman et al., 2015; 26287849, Yaeger et al., 2015; 25589621). In a randomized Phase 2 study for patients with 0_4 previous lines of therapy, the addition of vemurafenib to cetuximab and irinotecan significantly improved ORR (17% vs. 4.2%, n=50 and n=50) and DCR (65% vs. 21%) (Kopetz et al., 2020; 33356422). A Phase 2 trial evaluating the investigational agent spartalizumab, an anti_PD_1 antibody, with dabrafenib and trametinib reported an ORR of 35% (n=20) and DCR of 75% (Corcoran et al., 2020; ESMO GI Abstract SO_26). Extensive clinical evidence also supports a significant benefit in BRAF_inhibitor and MEK_inhibitor doublet therapy for patients with BRAF V600E_mutated metastatic CRC. A Phase 2 study of vemurafenib plus cobimetinib for patients with advanced BRAF V600E_mutated CRC reported an ORR of 29% (n=28) and DCR of 57% (Klute et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 122), and a similar trial of dabrafenib and trametinib reported a 12% ORR (n=43) and 67% DCR (Corcoran et al., 2015; 26392102). A basket trial of the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib for patients with BRAF V600_mutated solid cancers elicited 1 PR and 1 SD for 3 patients with CRC (Ascierto et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 9518). Outcomes for patients with BRAF amplifications have been studied almost exclusively in the context of concurrent activating alterations and resistance mechanisms (Rizos et al., 2014; 24463458, Stagni et al., 2018; 29626128, Wilson et al., 2015; 26307133); the evidence that BRAF amplification without a concurrent activating mutation is responsive to BRAF_pathway_targeting MEK or RAF inhibitors is very limited. A patient with triple_negative breast cancer with a high_level BRAF amplification and loss of PTEN and INPP4B achieved a major response to a combination of a MEK inhibitor and an AKT inhibitor (O Shaughnessy et al., 2011; SABC Abstract S3_5). Investigational ERK (Sullivan et al., 2018; 29247021) and second_generation BRAF inhibitors (Janku et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT212) are also in development; however, it is uncertain whether these strategies would be of benefit for patients with BRAF amplifications. On the basis of extensive clinical data, BRAF V600 mutation does not generally associate with significant clinical benefit from addition of cetuximab or panitumumab to chemotherapy (NCCN Colon Cancer Guidelines, v2.2021) (Pietrantonio et al., 2015; 25673558, Rowland et al., 2015; 25989278, Van Custem et al., 2011; 21502544, Smith et al., 2013; 23741067, Douillard et al., 2013; 24024839, Karapetis et al., 2014; 24218517, Peeters et al., 2013; 23325582, Peeters et al., 2015; 26341920, Guren et al., 2017; 28399112, Seymour et al., 2013; 23725851). Low response rates to cetuximab or panitumumab monotherapy or combination with chemotherapy have been frequently observed among patients with BRAF V600_mutated CRC, although similarly low response rates in this patient population were also often observed to chemotherapy alone; additionally, response rates were generally lower for patients with BRAF_mutated tumors than for those whose tumors were BRAF_wild_type (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Peeters et al., 2013; 23325582, Seymour et al., 2013; 23725851, Karapetis et al., 2014; 24218517, Di Nicolantonio et al., 2008; 19001320, Stintzing et al., 2017; 28463756, Tol et al., 2009; 19571295). In a limited number of patients with CRC treated with cetuximab_ or panitumumab_containing chemotherapy regimens, BRAF V600E was found to be present at the time of progression (Freeman et al., 2008; 18621636, Gao et al., 2011; 23357879, Soeda et al., 2013; 22638623, Molinari et al., 2011; 21632860, Andre et al., 2013; 23041588, Benvenuti et al., 2007; 17363584), to be a mechanism of acquired (Arena et al., 2015; 25623215, Montagut et al., 2012; 22270724) or primary (Todelo et al., 2017; 27852040) resistance, or to be enriched in nonresponders versus responders (Molinari et al., 2011; 21632860).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "BRAF activating alterations may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of BRAF, MEK, or ERK.

In addition, preclinical investigations have shown sensitivity to trametinib in cell lines with activating KRAS mutations in codons 12, 13, and 61 (Gilmartin et al., 2011; 21245089). Phase 1 and Phase 1b studies of trametinib, alone or in combination with gemcitabine, reported some activity in several types of solid tumors (Infante et al., 2013; 23583440, Infante et al., 2012; 22805291). However, Phase 1 monotherapy trials of RO4987655, another MEK inhibitor, have shown no responses and only 1 incidence of stable disease in 31 evaluable patients with CRC, including an expansion cohort of 24 patients with KRAS mutations (Leijen et al., 2012; 22767668, Zimmer et al., 2014; 24947927). In contrast, a trial of combination treatment with selumetinib (another MEK inhibitor) and irinotecan in patients with KRAS_mutated CRC reported confirmed partial responses (PR) in 3/31 (10%) patients, an unconfirmed PR in one patient (3%), and stable disease in 15/31 (48%) patients, improving upon historical clinical trial data of irinotecan single_agent treatment; longer progression_free survival compared to historical controls was also achieved (Hochster et al., 2013; ASCO GI Abstract 380). A Phase 1b trial of combination treatment with the MEK inhibitor MEK162 and the PI3K_alpha inhibitor BYL719 reported stable disease in 43% of patients with KRAS_mutated CRC, with responses independent of PIK3CA mutation status (Juric et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 9051). Another Phase 1b combination trial of trametinib and the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib in solid tumors observed ongoing partial responses in 2/28 (7%) of patients, including one patient with CRC harboring a NRAS Q61K mutation (Sullivan et al., 2015; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract PR06). Although the presence of a KRAS mutation in CRC has been associated with lack of efficacy to monotherapy MEK inhibitors (Infante et al., 2012; 22805291, Zimmer et al., 2014; 24947927, Bennouna et al., 2011; 20127139, Weekes et al., 2013; 23434733), the extent to which other alterations affecting this pathway, such as observed here, confers sensitivity to MEK inhibitors is unclear (Tsimberidou et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract e22086). Whereas frequent adverse events precluded a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for the combination of trametinib and everolimus in a Phase 1b trial for solid tumors (Tolcher et al., 2014; 25344362), a retrospective study for heavily pretreated patients with solid tumors reported tolerable regimens of the combination for 23/31 patients, with 16 patients treated >3 months and evaluable patients achieving a median PFS of 6.5 months (Patterson et al., 2018; AACR Abstract 3891). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Dabrafenib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Dabrafenib is a BRAF V600_selective inhibitor that is FDA approved as a monotherapy to treat melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations.

One case report describes a patient with colon adenocarcinoma who responded to a combination of dabrafenib, trametinib, and oxaliplatin (Williams et al., 2015; 26664139).

These kinases function downstream of RAS as part of the MAPK (RAF_MEK_ERK) signaling cascade that facilitates cell proliferation, survival and transformation (Holderfield et al., 2014; 24957944, Burotto et al., 2014; 24948110). BRAF mutations have been reported in up to 20% of all cancers, with the majority of mutations occurring at the V600 position (Davies et al., 2002; 12068308, Kandoth et al., 2013; 24132290). BRAF amplification has been reported and correlated with overexpression of the BRAF protein in various tumor types (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tanami et al., 2004; 15467732, Modrek et al., 2009; 19671679, Ciampi et al., 2005; 16199894). Among the V600 mutations, V600E accounts for 70_80% of observations, V600K for 10_30%, and V600R for 5_7%, with V600D comprising the majority of the rest (Davies et al., 2002; 12068308, Greaves et al., 2013; 23273605, Klein et al., 2013; 23237741). Mutations at V600 have been shown to constitutively activate BRAF kinase and hyperactivate the downstream MEK_ERK signaling, promoting oncogenic transformation (Wellbrock et al., 2004; 15059882, Davies et al., 2002; 12068308). In multiple cancer types, multiple mutations at V600, including V600E, V600K, V600R, V600D, and V600M exhibited sensitivity to V600_targeted therapies (Hauschild et al., 2012; 22735384, McArthur et al., 2014; 24508103, Fisher et al., 2012; 22904646, Yang et al., 2010; 20551065, Gentilcore et al., 2013; 23317446, Klein et al., 2013; 23237741, van den Brom et al., 2013; 23473613, Klein et al., 2013; 23490649, Ponti et al., 2013; 23463675, Ponti et al., 2012; 23031422, Parakh et al., 2015; 25382067, Lee et al., 2017; 28194436); other mutations at this position are predicted to behave similarly. BRAF mutations have been reported in approximately 5_19% of colorectal cancer samples (De Roock et al., 2011; 21163703, Di Nicolantonio et al., 2008; 19001320, Dienstmann et al., 2012; 22723336, Safaee et al., 2012; 23056577, Guedes et al., 2013; 23548132). BRAF V600E is a strong adverse prognostic marker in colorectal cancer (NCCN Colon Cancer Guidelines, v2.2021). BRAF mutations have been associated with poor prognosis and shorter survival in patients with colorectal cancer, particularly those with metastatic disease, as well as with smoking history (Sinicrope et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract 3514, Hassabo et al., 2014; ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium Abstract 473) (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Bokemeyer et al., 2012; 22446022, Gavin et al., 2012; 23045248, Laurent_Puig et al., 2009; 19884556, Ogino et al., 2012; 22147942, Roth et al., 2010; 20008640, Douillard et al., 2013; 24024839, Hsu et al., 2016; 26989027). Analysis of individual BRAF mutations in 2127 patients with advanced colorectal cancer treated with chemotherapy with or without cetuximab revealed that BRAF V600E associated with poor prognosis (HR 2.60, P=1.0e_15, with median reduction of survival being 320 days) and distinct clinicopathological features, including correlation with increased peritoneal metastases compared to BRAF wild_type tumors (24% vs. 12%, P=0.0015), while BRAF D594G inactivating mutation was not prognostic (HR 1.30, P=0.37) and had similar clinicopathologic features as BRAF wild_type tumors (Summers et al., 2016; 27815357). Significant benefit for patients with BRAF V600_mutated colorectal cancers (CRC) has been achieved with combinatorial approaches involving BRAF inhibitors, EGF_targeting antibodies, and MEK inhibitors (Kopetz et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 4001, Corcoran et al., 2018; 29431699, Hyman et al., 2015; 26287849, Yaeger et al., 2015; 25589621, Kopetz et al., 2020; 33356422). In a Phase 3 study for patients with metastatic CRC on second_ or third_line treatments, doublet therapy with the RAF inhibitor encorafenib and the EGFR antibody cetuximab showed superior mOS to cetuximab plus chemotherapy (9.3 vs. 5.9 months, HR=0.61, n=220 and n=221), and similar benefit was seen for a triplet therapy cohort adding the MEK inhibitor binimetinib (OS of 9.3 months, n=224) (Kopetz et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 4001). Combinations of other RAF inhibitors such as dabrafenib or vemurafenib with EGFR antibodies such as panitumumab have also resulted in clinical benefit for similar patient populations in Phase 1 and 2 studies. A trial of dabrafenib and panitumumab with or without the MEK inhibitor trametinib reported a 21% ORR and 86% DCR (n=91) for the triplet combination and a 10% ORR and 90% DCR (n=20) for the doublet therapy (Corcoran et al., 2018; 29431699). Multiple similar studies of vemurafenib with panitumumab or cetuximab doublet therapy have also reported a benefit (Hyman et al., 2015; 26287849, Yaeger et al., 2015; 25589621). In a randomized Phase 2 study for patients with 0_4 previous lines of therapy, the addition of vemurafenib to cetuximab and irinotecan significantly improved ORR (17% vs. 4.2%, n=50 and n=50) and DCR (65% vs. 21%) (Kopetz et al., 2020; 33356422). A Phase 2 trial evaluating the investigational agent spartalizumab, an anti_PD_1 antibody, with dabrafenib and trametinib reported an ORR of 35% (n=20) and DCR of 75% (Corcoran et al., 2020; ESMO GI Abstract SO_26). Extensive clinical evidence also supports a significant benefit in BRAF_inhibitor and MEK_inhibitor doublet therapy for patients with BRAF V600E_mutated metastatic CRC. A Phase 2 study of vemurafenib plus cobimetinib for patients with advanced BRAF V600E_mutated CRC reported an ORR of 29% (n=28) and DCR of 57% (Klute et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 122), and a similar trial of dabrafenib and trametinib reported a 12% ORR (n=43) and 67% DCR (Corcoran et al., 2015; 26392102). A basket trial of the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib for patients with BRAF V600_mutated solid cancers elicited 1 PR and 1 SD for 3 patients with CRC (Ascierto et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 9518). Outcomes for patients with BRAF amplifications have been studied almost exclusively in the context of concurrent activating alterations and resistance mechanisms (Rizos et al., 2014; 24463458, Stagni et al., 2018; 29626128, Wilson et al., 2015; 26307133); the evidence that BRAF amplification without a concurrent activating mutation is responsive to BRAF_pathway_targeting MEK or RAF inhibitors is very limited. A patient with triple_negative breast cancer with a high_level BRAF amplification and loss of PTEN and INPP4B achieved a major response to a combination of a MEK inhibitor and an AKT inhibitor (O Shaughnessy et al., 2011; SABC Abstract S3_5). Investigational ERK (Sullivan et al., 2018; 29247021) and second_generation BRAF inhibitors (Janku et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT212) are also in development; however, it is uncertain whether these strategies would be of benefit for patients with BRAF amplifications. On the basis of extensive clinical data, BRAF V600 mutation does not generally associate with significant clinical benefit from addition of cetuximab or panitumumab to chemotherapy (NCCN Colon Cancer Guidelines, v2.2021) (Pietrantonio et al., 2015; 25673558, Rowland et al., 2015; 25989278, Van Custem et al., 2011; 21502544, Smith et al., 2013; 23741067, Douillard et al., 2013; 24024839, Karapetis et al., 2014; 24218517, Peeters et al., 2013; 23325582, Peeters et al., 2015; 26341920, Guren et al., 2017; 28399112, Seymour et al., 2013; 23725851). Low response rates to cetuximab or panitumumab monotherapy or combination with chemotherapy have been frequently observed among patients with BRAF V600_mutated CRC, although similarly low response rates in this patient population were also often observed to chemotherapy alone; additionally, response rates were generally lower for patients with BRAF_mutated tumors than for those whose tumors were BRAF_wild_type (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Peeters et al., 2013; 23325582, Seymour et al., 2013; 23725851, Karapetis et al., 2014; 24218517, Di Nicolantonio et al., 2008; 19001320, Stintzing et al., 2017; 28463756, Tol et al., 2009; 19571295). In a limited number of patients with CRC treated with cetuximab_ or panitumumab_containing chemotherapy regimens, BRAF V600E was found to be present at the time of progression (Freeman et al., 2008; 18621636, Gao et al., 2011; 23357879, Soeda et al., 2013; 22638623, Molinari et al., 2011; 21632860, Andre et al., 2013; 23041588, Benvenuti et al., 2007; 17363584), to be a mechanism of acquired (Arena et al., 2015; 25623215, Montagut et al., 2012; 22270724) or primary (Todelo et al., 2017; 27852040) resistance, or to be enriched in nonresponders versus responders (Molinari et al., 2011; 21632860).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "BRAF activating alterations may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of BRAF, MEK, or ERK.

In addition, preclinical investigations have shown sensitivity to trametinib in cell lines with activating KRAS mutations in codons 12, 13, and 61 (Gilmartin et al., 2011; 21245089). Phase 1 and Phase 1b studies of trametinib, alone or in combination with gemcitabine, reported some activity in several types of solid tumors (Infante et al., 2013; 23583440, Infante et al., 2012; 22805291). However, Phase 1 monotherapy trials of RO4987655, another MEK inhibitor, have shown no responses and only 1 incidence of stable disease in 31 evaluable patients with CRC, including an expansion cohort of 24 patients with KRAS mutations (Leijen et al., 2012; 22767668, Zimmer et al., 2014; 24947927). In contrast, a trial of combination treatment with selumetinib (another MEK inhibitor) and irinotecan in patients with KRAS_mutated CRC reported confirmed partial responses (PR) in 3/31 (10%) patients, an unconfirmed PR in one patient (3%), and stable disease in 15/31 (48%) patients, improving upon historical clinical trial data of irinotecan single_agent treatment; longer progression_free survival compared to historical controls was also achieved (Hochster et al., 2013; ASCO GI Abstract 380). A Phase 1b trial of combination treatment with the MEK inhibitor MEK162 and the PI3K_alpha inhibitor BYL719 reported stable disease in 43% of patients with KRAS_mutated CRC, with responses independent of PIK3CA mutation status (Juric et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 9051). Another Phase 1b combination trial of trametinib and the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib in solid tumors observed ongoing partial responses in 2/28 (7%) of patients, including one patient with CRC harboring a NRAS Q61K mutation (Sullivan et al., 2015; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract PR06). Although the presence of a KRAS mutation in CRC has been associated with lack of efficacy to monotherapy MEK inhibitors (Infante et al., 2012; 22805291, Zimmer et al., 2014; 24947927, Bennouna et al., 2011; 20127139, Weekes et al., 2013; 23434733), the extent to which other alterations affecting this pathway, such as observed here, confers sensitivity to MEK inhibitors is unclear (Tsimberidou et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract e22086). Whereas frequent adverse events precluded a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for the combination of trametinib and everolimus in a Phase 1b trial for solid tumors (Tolcher et al., 2014; 25344362), a retrospective study for heavily pretreated patients with solid tumors reported tolerable regimens of the combination for 23/31 patients, with 16 patients treated >3 months and evaluable patients achieving a median PFS of 6.5 months (Patterson et al., 2018; AACR Abstract 3891). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Dabrafenib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Dabrafenib is a BRAF V600_selective inhibitor that is FDA approved as a monotherapy to treat melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations.

For patients with BRAF V600E_mutated mCRC, a combination of dabrafenib, trametinib, and panitumumab resulted in an ORR of 26% (9/35) (Atreya et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 103). A Phase 2 trial evaluating dabrafenib and trametinib in combination with the anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitor spartalizumab reported an ORR of 33% (7/21) for patients with BRAF V600_mutated mCRC, with a median duration of response of 5.6 months (Corcoran et al., 2020; ESMO GI Abstract SO_26). One case report describes a patient with colon adenocarcinoma who responded to a combination of dabrafenib, trametinib, and oxaliplatin (Williams et al., 2015; 26664139). Dabrafenib can induce adverse effects such as the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and keratoacanthomas caused by inactivation of wildtype BRAF that leads to paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway, but it has been reported to be well tolerated in patients with BRAF V600E_mutated thyroid cancer (Gibney et al., 2013; 23712190, Hauschild et al., 2012; 22735384, Falchook et al., 2015; 25285888).

It is an oncogene and may be activated in as many as 20% of cancers (Dang et al., 2006; 16904903). MYC dysregulation (amplification, overexpression, translocation) has been identified in a number of different cancer types (Nesbit et al., 1999; 10378696). MYC amplification has been significantly linked with increased mRNA and protein levels and results in the dysregulation of a large number of target genes (Blancato et al., 2004; 15083194, Dang et al., 2006; 16904903, Fromont et al., 2013; 23574779). Mutation and amplification of MYC have been observed in up to 2% and 5% of patients with colorectal cancer, respectively (cBioPortal, COSMIC, Sep 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Overexpression of MYC in colorectal carcinoma has been reported to occur in the absence of MYC amplification (Erisman et al., 1985; 3837853, Erisman et al., 1988; 3283655, Wang et al., 1994; 8086630). MYC is a target gene of beta_catenin and may be upregulated by aberrant WNT signaling in colorectal cancer (Herbst et al., 2014; 24467841). MYC overexpression has been reported in 62_91% of colorectal carcinomas studied (Huang et al., 2013; 24240588, Toon et al., 2014; 24503701, Erisman et al., 1985; 3837853, Wang et al., 1994; 8086630). MYC protein overexpression was reported to be a favorable prognostic biomarker in patients with colorectal cancer, and patients with low_level MYC amplification have been found to have significantly longer survival (Toon et al., 2014; 24503701, Augenlicht et al., 1997; 9135021). However, MYC amplification and high expression have been associated with metastatic and aggressive colorectal tumors (Wang et al., 1994; 8086630, Monnat et al., 1987; 3040597). There are no available therapies that directly target MYC. However, preclinical data indicate that MYC overexpression may predict sensitivity to investigational agents targeting CDK1 (Horiuchi et al., 2012; 22430491, Goga et al., 2007; 17589519), CDK2 (Molenaar et al., 2009; 19525400), Aurora kinase A (Dammert et al., 2019; 31375684, Mollaoglu et al., 2017; 28089889, Robert et al., 2017; 29088717, Wang et al., 2017; 28417568, Takahashi et al., 2015; 25632068, Li et al., 2018; 30226440, Kong et al., 2017; DOI: 10.21037/tcr.2017.06.41, Mahadeva et al.,2014; 24893165, Park et al., 2019; 31429028), Aurora kinase B (Helfrich et al., 2016; 27496133, Hook et al., 2012; 22222631, Yang et al., 2010; 20643922, He et al., 2019; 30540594), glutaminase (Shroff et al., 2015; 25964345, Effenberger et al., 2017; 29156762, Shen et al., 2018; 30103944, Xiang et al., 2015; 25915584), or BET bromodomain_containing proteins (Delmore et al., 2011; 21889194, Bandopadhayay et al., 2013; 24297863, Loven et al., 2013; 23582323, Otto et al., 2019; 31734632), as well as agents targeting both HDAC and PI3K (Dong et al., 2013; 23866964, Pei et al., 2016; 26977882; Fu et al., 2019; 30224636). A Phase 2 study reported a PFS benefit associated with a combination of the Aurora A kinase inhibitor alisertib and paclitaxel as second_line therapy for patients with MYC_overexpressed small cell lung cancer but not for patients without MYC overexpression (Simmons et al., 2020; 31655296). A patient with MYC_amplified invasive ductal breast carcinoma experienced a PR to an Aurora kinase inhibitor (Ganesan et al., 2014; 25253784). The glutaminase inhibitor CB_839, in combination with either everolimus or cabozantinib, has demonstrated encouraging efficacy in Phase 1 and 2 studies enrolling patients with pretreated advanced renal cell carcinoma (Tannir et al., 2018; ASCO GU Abstract 603, Motzer et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA54). MYC amplification has also been suggested to predict response to chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer in some studies (Pereira et al., 2013; 23555992, Yasojima et al., 2011; 21741827). Preclinical evidence suggests that colon cancer cells with MYC amplification may be more sensitive to 5_fluorouracil and paclitaxel (Arango et al., 2001; 11406570, Bottone et al., 2003; 14516787).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "MYC overexpression may predict sensitivity to inhibition of CDKs, especially CDK1 and CDK2, of Aurora kinases, including Aurora kinase A and B, and of BET domain proteins, which are reported to downregulate MYC expression and MYC_dependent transcriptional programs.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT03220347", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03297424", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04555837", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT01434316", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "RNF43", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "A193fs*6", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "A193fs*6"}}, "Interpretation": "RNF43 encodes a ubiquitin ligase (Sugiura et al., 2008; 18313049) that was discovered because it is overexpressed in colon cancer (Yagyu et al., 2004; 15492824). RNF43 and the homologous E3 ubiquitin ligase ZNRF3 are tumor suppressors that function as negative regulators of WNT signaling (Hao et al., 2012; 22575959, Koo et al., 2012; 22895187, Jiang et al., 2013; 23847203, Koo et al., 2015; 26023187, Tsukiyama et al., 2015; 25825523). An additional tumor_suppressor_like role for RNF43 in colon cancer is hypothesized to occur via its interaction with the ubiquitin_protein ligase NEDL1, which is predicted to enhance the pro_apoptotic effects of p53 (Shinada et al., 2011; 21108931). Mutations in RNF43 have been reported in 18_27% of endometrial cancers (Kinde et al., 2013; 23303603, Giannakis et al., 2014; 25344691), 3_5% of pancreatic cancers (Madan and Virshup, 2015; 25901018), 21% of ovarian mucinous carcinomas (Ryland et al., 2013; 23096461), 9% of liver fluke_associated cholangiocarcinomas (Ong et al., 2012; 22561520), and up to 18% of colorectal cancers (Giannakis et al., 2014; 25344691, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696). RNF43 mutations are associated with mismatch repair deficiency and microsatellite instability (MSI) in colorectal (Giannakis et al., 2014; 25344691), endometrial (Giannakis et al., 2014; 25344691), and gastric cancers (Wang et al., 2014; 24816253, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317); one study reported RNF43 alterations in more than 50% of MSI gastric carcinomas (Wang et al., 2014; 24816253). Preclinical studies have reported that RNF43 is a negative regulator of WNT signaling, and RNF43 loss or inactivation leads to WNT activation and confers sensitivity to WNT pathway inhibitors, particularly Porcupine inhibitors, in multiple tumor types (Hao et al., 2012; 22575959, Koo et al., 2012; 22895187, Jiang et al., 2013; 23847203, Koo et al., 2015; 26023187, Tsukiyama et al., 2015; 25825523).

No alterations in KRAS were identified in this case. Approximately 50_65% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) have been reported to lack KRAS mutations (Lievre et al., 2006; 16618717, De Roock et al., 2011; 21163703, Chen et al., 2014; 25367198, Li et al., 2015; 25929517, Hu et al., 2016; 27977612, Zekri et al., 2017; 28218784, Staudacher et al., 2017; 29048416, Wang et al., 2018; 29705968, Guo et al., 2018; 29666387). Numerous studies have reported that KRAS wild_type status is associated with decreased metastasis, better clinicopathological features, and longer survival of patients with CRC (Chen et al., 2014; 25367198, Li et al., 2015; 25929517, Hu et al., 2016; 27977612, M\u00e1rmol et al., 2017; 28106826, Zekri et al., 2017; 28218784, Kwak et al., 2017; 28858102).

Decreased expression of MTAP leads to MTA accumulation within tumor cells and their microenvironment (Kirovski et al., 2011; 21356366, Limm et al., 2013; 23265702, Stevens et al., 2009; 19097084), thereby reducing intracellular arginine methylation (Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473, Mavrakis et al., 2016; 26912361, Kryukov et al., 2016; 26912360) and altering cell signaling (Limm et al., 2014; 25087184, Stevens et al., 2009; 19097084). MTAP is located at 9p21, adjacent to CDKN2A and CDKN2B, with which it is frequently co_deleted in various cancers. Other alterations in MTAP are rare and have not been extensively characterized. MTAP loss/homozygous deletion as well as loss of expression has been reported in a wide variety of solid tumors and hematologic cancers (Wei et al., 2016; 27929028, Zhao and Zhao, 2016; 27556634); such events have been correlated with poor prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (Kirovski et al., 2011; 21356366), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (Huang et al., 2009; 19887491), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)(Marce et al., 2006; 16778103), melanoma (Meyer et al., 2010; 20500769, Wild et al., 2006; 16618867), gastric cancer (Kim et al., 2011; 21412930), myxofibrosarcoma (Li et al., 2014; 25426549), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (He et al., 2015; 26656376), ovarian carcinoma (Wei et al., 2016; 27929028) and non_small cell lung cancer (Su et al., 2014; 24969958). MTAP loss was not prognostic in pediatric B_cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (Mirebeau et al., 2006; 16818274) or in astrocytoma (Becker et al., 2015; 26088413). However, MTAP has also been reported to be overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (Snezhkina et al., 2016; 27433286), and MTAP retention is thought to be important for prostate cancer growth due to continuous supply of SAM (Bistulfi et al., 2016; 26910893). Germline SNPs in MTAP have been correlated with the development of cutaneous melanoma (Antonopoulou et al., 2015; 25407435, Mccioni et al., 2013; 23816148), esophageal cancer (Hyland et al., 2016; 26635288, Lin et al., 2017; 27960044), osteosarcoma (Zhi et al., 2016; 27994653), and CRC (Gu et al., 2013; 23361049). Preclinical and limited clinical evidence indicate that MTAP inactivation produces specific metabolic vulnerabilities. MTAP inactivation may confer sensitivity to MAT2A inhibitors (Heist et al., 2019; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract B116, Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473). A Phase 1 trial of MAT2A inhibitor AG_270 reported 1 PR and 2 SDs lasting longer than 6 months for patients with advanced solid tumors displaying MTAP loss (Heist et al., 2019; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract B116). Although preclinical data have suggested that MTAP loss sensitizes cells to PRMT5 inhibition (Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473, Mavrakis et al., 2016; 26912361, Kryukov et al., 2016; 2691236), MTAP loss may not be a biomarker of response to previously developed small_molecule SAM_uncompetitive PRMT5 inhibitors (Guccione and Richard, 2019; 31350521); dual PRMT1 and PRMT5 inhibition may be more effective (Fedoriw et al., 2019; 31257072, Srour et al., 2019; 31287990, Gao et al., 2019; 30916320). In preclinical cancer models, MTAP inactivation showed increased sensitivity to inhibitors of purine synthesis or purine analogs, especially upon addition of exogenous MTA, which is converted to adenine in normal cells, thereby providing competition to purine poisons lacking in MTAP_deficient cells (Hansen et al., 2019; 31040154, Tang et al., 2018; 29844120, Munshi et al., 2014; 24928612, de Oliveira et al., 2016; 26751376, Lubin and Lubin, 2009; 19478948, Tang et al., 2012; 22825330, Collins et al., 2012; 22252602, Bertino et al., 2011; 21301207, Coulthard et al., 2011; 21282358, Miyazaki et al., 2007; 17912432, Efferth et al., 2002; 11987241). A Phase 2 study of L_alanosine, an inhibitor of adenine synthesis, as a monotherapy for 65 patients with MTAP_deficient cancers reported no responses and stable disease in 23.6% (13/55) of patients (Kindler et al., 2009; 18618081).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS colorectal cancers (CRCs) make up 70_85% of CRC cases (Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894). MSS colorectal cancers are molecularly heterogeneous, driven by diverse mechanisms such as extensive DNA methylation, oncogenic mutations in KRAS or BRAF, or chromosomal instability (Jass, 2007; 17204026). Multiple studies have shown that MSS CRCs have a worse prognosis than MSI_high tumors (Samowitz et al., 2001; 11535541, Elsaleh and Iacopetta, 2001; 12445368, Brueckl et al., 2003; 12820457, Guidoboni et al., 2001; 11438476, Gryfe et al., 2000; 10631274, Sinicrope et al., 2006; 16952542, Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Laghi and Malesci, 2012; 22722556). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60). For patients with chemotherapy_refractory metastatic colorectal cancer, 92% of which were MSS or MSI_Intermediate, a Phase 3 trial reported no OS advantage from the combination of the PD_L1 inhibitor atezolizumab plus cobimetinib relative to regorafenib (8.9 vs. 8.5 months, HR=1.00); atezolizumab monotherapy similarly did not prolong OS (7.1 vs. 8.5 months, HR=1.19) (Ciardiello et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract LBA_004). MSI has not been found to be a predictive biomarker for combination chemotherapy regimens, including FOLFOX (Sinicrope et al., 2013; 24019539, Gavin et al., 2012; 23045248) and FOLFIRI (Bertagnolli et al., 2009; 19273709, Van Cutsem et al., 2009; 19451425). Patients with MSS CRC are more likely to benefit from postsurgical fluorouracil (FU)_based adjuvant therapy (Ribic et al., 2003; 12867608, Sargent et al., 2010; 20498393) but less likely to benefit from irinotecan chemotherapy (Fallik et al., 2003; 14522894).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "NRAS", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "wildtype", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "wildtype"}}, "Interpretation": "NRAS encodes a member of the RAS family of small GTPases that mediate transduction of growth signals. Activation of RAS signaling causes cell growth, differentiation, and survival by activating the RAF_MAPK_ERK, PI3K, and other pathways (Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244). No alterations in NRAS were identified in this case. The majority of colorectal cancers (CRCs) (91_98%) have been reported to lack NRAS mutations (Pentheroudakis et al., 2013; 23374602, Vaughn et al., 2011; 21305640, Janku et al., 2013; 23400451, De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739, Irahara et al., 2010; 20736745, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Schirripa et al., 2015; 24806288, Guo et al., 2018; 29666387). NRAS wild_type status has been reported to be associated with decreased frequency of metastasis (Guo et al., 2018; 29666387) and longer survival (Schirripa et al., 2015; 24806288, Cercek et al., 2017; 28446505) of patients with CRC.

SMAD4 alterations that result in loss or disruption of the MH1 domain (aa 18_142), MH2 domain (aa 323_552), or SAD domain (aa 275_320) are predicted to be inactivating (Massague et al., 2005; 16322555, Mor\u00e9n et al., 2000; 10980615, Xu and Attisano, 2000; 10781087, Luo et al., 1999; 10485843, Jones and Kern, 2000; 10871368, Fink et al., 2001; 11196171, De Bosscher et al., 2004; 14715079, Shi et al., 1997; 9214508, Miyaki et al., 1999; 10340381, Prokova et al., 2007; 17994767, Wu et al., 2001; 11274206, Ding et al., 2009; 19139564, Kuang et al., 2004; 14647410, Watanabe et al., 2000; 11265759, Bosscher et al., 2004; 14715079). SMAD4 mutation or homozygous deletion is most frequently observed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (43%)(cBio_Witkiewicz et al., 2015; 25855536), pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (Jiao et al., 2014; 24293293), cholangiocarcinoma (25%)(Churi et al., 2014; 25536104), appendiceal adenocarcinoma (14_20% mutation; 57% deletion)(Liu et al., 2014; 24821835, Maru et al., 2004; 14647445), colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC; 14%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696), esophageal adenocarcinoma (14%)(Wang et al., 2015; 26336083), and stomach adenocarcinoma (13%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317). In preclinical studies, SMAD4 loss of function has been implicated in the development of mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas, including mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN)(Izeradjene et al., 2007; 17349581) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN)(Bardeesy et al., 2006; 17114584); in clinical samples, SMAD4 homozygous deletion has been observed in 10% of IPMNs and 8% of MCNs, and mutation was also observed in 5% of IPMNs (Springer et al., 2015; 26253305). SMAD4 gene alterations have been associated with reduced overall survival for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Blackford et al., 2009; 19584151). Reduced SMAD4 expression has been associated with worse prognosis in various cancer types, including CRC (Yan et al., 2016; 26861460, Kozak et al., 2015; 25681512, Roth et al., 2012; 23104212), appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (Davison et al., 2014; 24618609), gastric adenocarcinoma (Kim et al., 2004; 15033661, Xiangming et al., 2001; 11234879), esophageal adenocarcinoma (Singhi et al., 2015; 25634752), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Natsugoe et al., 2002; 12060625), breast cancer (de Kruijf et al., 2013; 23022998), and prostate cancer (Shipitsin et al., 2014; 25032733). There are no therapies to address SMAD4 alterations in cancer. Preclinical studies (Cui et al., 2012; 22753594, Haeger et al., 2016; 25893305) and a clinical study of pancreatic cancer suggest that low SMAD4 expression exhibit increased responsiveness to chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin and irinotecan (Bachet et al., 2012; 22377565). One or more of the SMAD4 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with juvenile polyposis syndrome (ClinVar, Mar 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline SMAD4 mutations, including those at the R361 hotspot, have been observed in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome (Houlston et al., 1998; 9811934, Woodford_Richens et al., 2000; 10764709, Howe et al., 2004; 15235019, Howe et al., 2004; 15235019, Howe et al., 2004; 15235019), which is associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal cancers (Brosens et al., 2011; 22171123). The penetrance of deleterious SMAD4 mutations in patients with colon cancer is estimated at 20% by age 35 and 70% by age 65 (Kalia et al., 2017; 27854360). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of SMAD4 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "D228fs*1", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "D228fs*1"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 mutations have been reported in up to 60% of colorectal cancer cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Goh et al., 1995; 7585578, Berg et al., 2010; 21103049, Han et al., 2013; 23700467, Peeters et al., 2013; 23325582, Malhotra et al., 2013; 23526092, Di Bartolomeo et al., 2013; 23821376). A study reported p53 expression in 49% of analyzed colorectal cancer cases (Wangefjord et al., 2013; 23337059). TP53 mutation has not been consistently demonstrated to be a significant independent prognostic marker in the context of CRC (Russo et al., 2005; 16172461). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% (17/176) and SDs in 53.4% (94/176) of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21.1% (4/19) in patients with TP53 mutations versus 12.1% (4/33) in patients who were TP53 wild_type (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 31.9% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73.4% (69/94) DCR in patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 42.9% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76.2% (16/21) DCR in patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24.0% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71.4% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel in patients with solid tumors, 75.0% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Additionally, the combination of a CHK1 inhibitor and irinotecan reportedly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival in a TP53_mutated, but not TP53_wild_type, breast cancer xenotransplant mouse model (Ma et al., 2012; 22446188). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "04", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "04"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen.

This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Fabrizio et al., 2018; 30151257, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526). Elevated TMB has been reported in 8_25% of colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (George et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3587, Nagahashi et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e15103)(Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). Multiple studies have reported that the majority (up to 90%) of hypermutant CRC cases exhibit high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI_H) and mismatch repair deficiency (MMR_D) (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). Increased TMB is significantly associated with MSI_H and MMR_D, with studies reporting that 100% of MSI_H CRCs harbor elevated TMB and, conversely, that 100% of tumors with low TMB harbor intact MMR (George et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3587, Nagahashi et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e15103)(Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). A subset of CRCs that harbor increased TMB but not MSI_H are driven by mutations in POLE, which lead to an \u201cultramutated\u201d phenotype with especially high TMB (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). Tumors with increased TMB harbor BRAF V600E mutations more frequently than those with low TMB (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117), whereas TMB_low tumors more frequently harbor mutations in TP53 and APC (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696). In a study for 61 patients with metastatic, microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC treated with best standard of care, plasma TMB scores \u226528 muts/Mb (approximately 14 muts/Mb as measured by this assay) were associated with reduced OS as compared with plasma TMB scores <28 muts/Mb (3.0 vs. 5.3 months, HR 0.76, p=0.007), whereas tissue TMB was not found to be prognostic in this population (Chen et al., 2020; 32379280, Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, higher TMB has been reported to be associated with increased ORR and OS from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). Higher TMB was found to be significantly associated with improved OS upon immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment for patients with 9 types of advanced tumors (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254). Analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy, compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386). However, the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors found significant improvement in ORR for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (based on this assay or others) compared to those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb, in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types; similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). Together, these studies suggest that patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb may derive clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1 inhibitors. In CRC specifically, a retrospective analysis of immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy reported significantly improved OS for patients with tumors harboring TMB \u22659.8 Muts/MB compared with those with tumors with TMB <9.8 Muts/Mb (~ equivalency <12 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254). Another retrospective study reported that a TMB \u226512 Muts/Mb cutoff identifies >99% of MSI_High CRC cases but only 3% of MSS cases, indicating the utility of this cutoff for identification of patients with CRC likely to benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Fabrizio et al., 2018; 30151257).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "BRAF", "Alteration": "V600Eamplification", "Title": "Efficacy and Safety of Targeted Precision Therapy in Refractory Tumor With Druggable Molecular Event", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB4, PARP, mTOR, MET, RET, ROS1, VEGFRs, BRAF, CDK4, CDK6", "Locations": "Shanghai (China)", "NCTID": "NCT03239015", "Note": "BRAF activating alterations may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of BRAF, MEK, or ERK.
