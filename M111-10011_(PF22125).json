APC interacts with beta_catenin and controls signaling in the WNT pathway, which regulates embryonic development and cell differentiation (Logan and Nusse, 2004; 15473860). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt APC function or expression (Eklof et al., 2001; 11707392, Liu et al., 2006; 16753179, Dikovskaya et al., 2010; 20144988, Murphy et al., 2007; 17410430, Aretz et al., 2004; 15459959). APC mutations have been found in 73% of tumors in the colorectal adenocarcinoma TCGA dataset (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696). In 1 study, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of APC was observed in 32% of colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (Christie et al., 2013; 23085758). The prognostic significance of APC mutations in sporadic CRC remains unclear (Quyn et al., 2008; 19110823). Solid tumors with WNT/beta_catenin pathway alterations, as seen here, were observed to have significantly less T_cell inflammation in one study (Luke et al., 2019; 30635339). There are no approved drugs targeting APC inactivation in cancer. Loss of APC function leads to accumulation of beta_catenin and upregulation of WNT pathway transcription programs (Zhan et al., 2017; 27617575), and potential therapeutic approaches to target this pathway include CBP/beta_catenin antagonists, which interfere with the ability of beta_catenin to interact with transcriptional co_activator CBP (Jung et al., 2020; 32037398, Krishnamurthy and Kurzrock, 2018; 29169144). In a Phase 1 trial of the CBP/beta_catenin antagonist E7386, 1 patient with APC_mutated small bowel adenocarcinoma achieved a PR with tumor shrinkage of _69% and response duration of 165 days (Kawazoe et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 473P); preclinical data support sensitivity of APC_deficient gastric or colorectal cancer models to E7386 (Yamada et al., 2021; 33408116, Kanda et al., 2022; 34837838). One or more of the APC variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (ClinVar, Sep 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in APC are found in more than 90% of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) (Kerr et al., 2013; 23159591, Fearon, 2011; 21090969, Kastritis et al., 2009; 18844223).

Activating mutations in RAS genes can cause uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor formation (Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Kahn et al., 1987; 3310850). KRAS alterations affecting amino acids G12, G13, Q22, P34, A59, Q61, and A146, as well as mutations G10_A11insG, G10_A11insAG (also reported as G10_A11dup and G12_G13insAG), A18D, L19F, D33E, G60_A66dup/E62_A66dup, E62K, E63K, R68S, and K117N have been characterized as activating and oncogenic (Akagi et al., 2007; 17150185, Bollag et al., 1996; 8955068, Buhrman et al., 2010; 20194776, Colicelli, 2004; 15367757, Edkins et al., 2006; 16969076, Feig and Cooper, 1988; 3043178, Gremer et al., 2011; 20949621, Janakiraman et al., 2010; 20570890, Kim et al., 2016; 27147599, Lukman et al., 2010; 20838576, Naguib et al., 2011; 21371307, Prior et al., 2012; 22589270, Priv\u00e9 et al., 1992; 1565661, Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Scheffzek et al., 1997; 9219684, Scholl et al., 2009; 19490892, Smith et al., 2010; 20147967, Tyner et al., 2009; 19075190, Valencia et al., 1991; 2029511, White et al., 2016; 26854029, Wiest et al., 1994; 8058307, Kim et al., 2016; 27147599, Angeles et al., 2019; 31289513, Tong et al., 2014; 24642870, Loree et al., 2021; 34117033). Mutations in KRAS have been reported in approximately 35_50% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) (Lievre et al., 2006; 16618717, De Roock et al., 2011; 21163703, Chen et al., 2014; 25367198, Li et al., 2015; 25929517, Hu et al., 2016; 27977612, Zekri et al., 2017; 28218784, Staudacher et al., 2017; 29048416, Wang et al., 2018; 29705968, Guo et al., 2018; 29666387). Numerous studies have reported that KRAS mutations are associated with increased metastasis, adverse clinicopathological features, and shorter survival of patients with CRC (Chen et al., 2014; 25367198, Li et al., 2015; 25929517, Hu et al., 2016; 27977612, M\u00e1rmol et al., 2017; 28106826, Zekri et al., 2017; 28218784, Kwak et al., 2017; 28858102). Preclinical evidence suggests that KRAS activation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, such as trametinib, binimetinib, cobimetinib, and selumetinib (Nakano et al., 1984; 6320174, Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Yamaguchi et al., 2011; 21523318, Watanabe et al., 2013; 23438367, Gilmartin et al., 2011; 21245089, Yeh et al., 2009; 19372556). However, multiple clinical trials have reported lack of efficacy of trametinib and other MEK inhibitors when used as monotherapy for treatment of patients with KRAS_mutant CRC (Tsimberidou et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract e22086)(Infante et al., 2012; 22805291, Zimmer et al., 2014; 24947927, Bennouna et al., 2011; 20127139, Weekes et al., 2013; 23434733). Both clinical (Hochster et al., 2013; ASCO GI Abstract 380, Juric et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 9051) and preclinical (Lamba et al., 2014; 25199829, Sun et al, 2014; 24685132) studies suggest that combinatorial approaches including MEK inhibitors are likely to be more effective for the treatment of CRC, including strategies such as combination of MEK inhibitors with PI3K inhibitors (Juric et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 9051), RAF inhibitors (Lamba et al., 2014; 25199829), pan_ERBB inhibitors (Sun et al, 2014; 24685132), or chemotherapeutic agents (Hochster et al., 2013; ASCO GI Abstract 380). In a Phase 1 study evaluating the MEK_pan_RAF dual inhibitor CH5126766, 6 patients harboring KRAS mutations experienced PRs, including 3 with non_small cell lung cancer (NCSLC), 1 with low_grade serous ovarian carcinoma (LGSOC), 1 with endometrial adenocarcinoma, and 1 with multiple myeloma (Guo et al., 2020; 33128873). Combination of CH5126766 with the FAK inhibitor defactinib elicited PR rates of 50% (4/8) for patients with KRAS_mutated low_grade serous ovarian cancer and 12% (2/17) for patients with KRAS_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a Phase 1 study (Krebs et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT019, Shinde et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT143). Preclinical and clinical data suggest that KRAS mutations may predict clinical benefit from SHP2 inhibitors (Lu et al., 2019; 31068384, Mainardi et al., 2018; 29808006, Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001, Brana et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3005, Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). A Phase 1 study of RMC_4630 for relapsed/refractory solid tumors reported a DCR of 58% (23/40) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS mutations and a DCR of 75% (12/16) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS G12C mutations (Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001). Interim results from a Phase 1/2 study of RMC_4630 plus cobimetinib reported tumor reduction in 3 of 8 patients with KRAS_mutated colorectal cancer (Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). Preclinical data suggest that KRAS mutation may confer sensitivity to SOS1 inhibitors (Hillig et al., 2019; 30683722, Hofmann et al., 2021; 32816843, Gerlach et al., 2020; AACR Abstract 1091). Phase 1 studies of the SOS1 inhibitor BI 1701963 alone or in combination with MEK inhibitors, KRAS G12C inhibitors, or irinotecan are recruiting for patients with solid tumors harboring KRAS mutations (Hofmann et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT210, Gort et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract TPS3651). Preclinical and limited clinical evidence suggest that KRAS mutation may predict sensitivity to PLK1 inhibitors (Luo et al., 2009; 19490893, Lenz et al., 2020; ASCO GI Abstract TPS265). A Phase 1b/2 study of PLK1 inhibitor onvansertib in combination with FOLFIRI and bevacizumab for patients with KRAS_mutated metastatic CRC previously treated with chemotherapy reported an 87.5% (7/8; 3 PR, 4 SD) clinical benefit rate, with 1 patient going on to successful curative surgery (Barzi et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT235). Activating mutations in KRAS or NRAS are associated with lack of clinical benefit from cetuximab (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Bokemeyer et al., 2011; 21228335, Karapetis et al., 2008; 18946061, De Roock et al., 2008; 17998284) or panitumumab (Douillard et al., 2014; 24718886, Douillard et al., 2012; 24024839, Amado et al., 2008; 18316791) for patients with CRC.

Activating mutations in either KRAS (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Bokemeyer et al., 2011; 21228335, Karapetis et al., 2008; 18946061, De Roock et al., 2008; 17998284) or NRAS (Di Bartolomeo et al., 2013; 23821376, De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739), which function downstream of EGFR, are associated with lack of benefit of cetuximab for patients with CRC and indicate against the use of cetuximab (NCCN Guidelines v1.2022). A study comparing PIK3CA exon 9 and 20 mutations reported that for patients with chemotherapy_refractory CRC, PIK3CA exon 20 mutations were associated with less benefit from cetuximab compared with PIK3CA wildtype (ORR of 0.0% [0/9] vs. 37% [121/329], PFS of 11.5 vs. 24 weeks, and OS of 34 vs. 51 weeks); this effect was not observed with PIK3CA exon 9 mutations (ORR of 29% [6/21] vs. 36% [115/317], PFS of 23.5 vs. 24 weeks, and OS of 46 vs. 51 weeks) (De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739). The presence of PIK3CA exon 9 and 20 mutations showed no correlation with objective tumor response to cetuximab but was associated with reduced PFS in response to cetuximab salvage therapy (HR=2.1) (Souglakos et al., 2009; 19603024). In contrast, multiple studies and case reports of cetuximab treatment of CRC have reported similar responses in patients with PIK3CA exon 9 or 20 mutations compared with PIK3CA wildtype (Cappuzzo et al., 2008; 18577988, Tol et al., 2010; 20413299, Prenan et al., 2009; 19366826, Bray et al., 2019; 31653970, Lambrechts et al., 2009; ASCO Abstract 4020, Karapetis et al., 2013; 24218517, Moiseyenko et al., 2018; 29470838, Fu et al., 2021; 33842311). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> Cetuximab has been shown to improve OS, PFS, and response rate for patients with KRAS_wildtype colorectal cancer (CRC), both in combination with FOLFIRI, FOLFOX4, or irinotecan (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Bokemeyer et al., 2011; 21228335, Jonker et al., 2007; 18003960, Cunningham et al., 2004; 15269313, Papamichael et al., 2022; 35033994) and as monotherapy for chemotherapy_refractory patients (De Roock et al., 2008; 17998284, Karapetis et al., 2014; 24218517). The Phase 3 study STRATEGIC_1 reported a similar duration of disease control (DDC) for patients with unresectable metastatic CRC (mCRC) and KRAS_, NRAS_, and BRAF_wildtype status treated with mFOLFOX_bevacizumab alternated with a cetuximab regimen in first or second line, respectively (overall DDC 22.5 vs. 23.5 months); in addition, the study reported similar OS (37.8 vs. 34.4 months) and higher numerical ORR for patients treated with cetuximab in the first line followed by mFOLFOX_bevacizumab compared with those receiving EGFR_directed antibodies in the second or third line (Chibaudel et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 3504). A prospective study of cetuximab monotherapy for patients with KRAS_, NRAS_, and BRAF_wildtype mCRC reported 11% (2/19) PRs and 58% (11/19) SDs (Moiseyenko et al., 2018; 29470838).

In a similar patient population, a Phase 2 study of combination panitumumab and irinotecan versus combination cetuximab and irinotecan also demonstrated non_inferiority with respect to median PFS (5.4 vs. 4.3 months, HR = 0.64) and median OS (14.9 vs. 11.5 months, HR=0.66)(Sakai et al., 2020; 32526634). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Resistant", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04985604", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04803318", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03284502", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04303403", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04870034", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04720976", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04965818", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04214418", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03905148", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "PIK3CA", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "H1047L", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "H1047L"}}, "Interpretation": "PIK3CA encodes p110_alpha, which is the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3_kinase (PI3K). The PI3K pathway is involved in cell signaling that regulates a number of critical cellular functions, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival (Samuels et al., 2005; 15950905, Engelman, 2009; 19629070). PIK3CA alterations that have been characterized as activating, such as observed here, are predicted to be oncogenic (Kang et al., 2005; 15647370, Ikenoue et al., 2005; 15930273, Gymnopoulos et al., 2007; 17376864, Horn et al., 2008; 18317450, Rudd et al., 2011; 21266528, Hon et al., 2012; 22120714, Burke et al., 2012; 22949682, Wu et al., 2009; 19915146, Dbouk et al., 2010; 2103068, Dan et al., 2010; 20530683, Oda et al., 2008; 18829572, Zhao and Vogt, 2008; 18794883, Lui et al., 2013; 23619167, Ross et al., 2013; 22430209, Riviere et al., 2012; 22729224, Shibata et al., 2009; 19394761, Droguluk et al., 2015; 26627007, Croessmann et al., 2018; 29284706, Ng et al., 2018; 29533785, Spangle et al., 2020; 32929011, Chen et al., 2018; 29636477, Jin et al., 2021; 34779417). PIK3CA mutations have been reported in up to 19% of colorectal cancers (CRCs)(Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, cBio_Brannon et al., 2014; 25164765). A meta_analysis of 864 patients with colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab_ or panitumumab_based therapy showed that PIK3CA mutations, particularly in exon 20 (H1047R), are significantly associated with worse response (Huang et al., 2014; 24701207) and shorter progression_free and overall survival (De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739). A study of 354 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer observed no difference in overall survival between patients with PIK3CA mutations versus those without (21.7 months vs. 22.4 months, respectively); however, the study did not include treatment information for the patients (Fong et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 57). Clinical and preclinical data in various tumor types indicate that PIK3CA activating alterations may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting PI3K (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574, Juric et al., 2018; 29401002, Gallant et al., 2019; 30793038, Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23, Delestre et al., 2021; 34613809, Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Santin et al., 2020; 31934607, Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871), AKT (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Smyth et al., 2021; 33863913), or mTOR (Varnier et al., 2019; 31351267, Basse et al., 2018; 32914004, Sultova et al., 2021; 33277683, Mackay et al., 2014; 24166148, Myers et al., 2016; 27016228, Dhami et al., 2018; 29588307, Harris et al., 2019; 30863722, Hanna et al., 2018; 29301825). The Phase 2 NCI_MATCH study of copanlisib for patients with refractory solid tumors harboring PIK3CA mutations with or without PTEN loss met its primary endpoint with an ORR of 16% (4/25 PRs); responses (PR or SD >6 months) were seen in patients with ameloblastoma, liposarcoma, and carcinomas of the endometrium, ovary, esophagus, lung, and prostate (Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871). However, the Phase 2 study of copanlisib for patients with endometrial carcinoma harboring PIK3CA hotspot mutations failed to report any objective responses (n=11)(Santin et al., 2020; 31934607). Two other studies of copanlisib for patients with genomically unselected tumors reported 1 CR and 2 PRs (1 unconfirmed) among 16 total patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors with or without PTEN alterations (Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108). Emerging evidence suggests that the glutaminase inhibitor telaglenastat has clinical activity in PIK3CA_mutated colorectal cancer (CRC). A Phase 1 trial of telaglenastat and capecitabine for patients with CRC who progressed on fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy observed numerically increased median PFS for patients with PIK3CA mutation compared with patients with wildtype PIK3CA status (24.8 vs. 16 weeks, n=7 vs. n=4), including SD >30 weeks for 3 patients with PIK3CA mutation (Zhao et al., 2020; 32907836). Multiple clinical studies report that inhibitors of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway have not produced significant clinical benefit as monotherapies to treat CRC, even for tumors that harbor alterations in PIK3CA or PTEN; data are more limited for alterations in other genes in this pathway (Ng et al., 2013; 23743569, Ganesan et al., 2013; 24092809, Janku et al., 2014; 24440717). Based on clinical data, it is unclear whether the presence of PIK3CA mutations is associated with reduced sensitivity to cetuximab in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Detection of PIK3CA mutations at progression was observed for patients with CRC following treatment with cetuximab (Xu et al., 2017; 28424201, Kim et al., 2021; 34315006, Soeda et al., 2013; 22638623). A study comparing PIK3CA exon 9 and 20 mutations reported that for patients with chemotherapy_refractory CRC, PIK3CA exon 20 mutations were associated with less benefit from cetuximab compared with PIK3CA wildtype; this effect was not observed with PIK3CA exon 9 mutations (De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739). In contrast, multiple studies and case reports of cetuximab treatment of CRC have reported similar responses in patients with PIK3CA exon 9 or 20 mutations compared with PIK3CA wildtype (Cappuzzo et al., 2008; 18577988, Tol et al., 2010; 20413299, Prenan et al., 2009; 19366826, Bray et al., 2019; 31653970, Lambrechts et al., 2009; ASCO Abstract 4020, Karapetis et al., 2013; 24218517, Moiseyenko et al., 2018; 29470838, Fu et al., 2021; 33842311).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PIK3CA activating mutations may lead to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may therefore indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.

Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance.

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS colorectal cancers (CRCs) make up 70_85% of CRC cases (Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894). MSS colorectal cancers are molecularly heterogeneous, driven by diverse mechanisms such as extensive DNA methylation, oncogenic mutations in KRAS or BRAF, or chromosomal instability (Jass, 2007; 17204026). Multiple studies have shown that MSS CRCs have a worse prognosis than MSI_high tumors (Samowitz et al., 2001; 11535541, Elsaleh and Iacopetta, 2001; 12445368, Brueckl et al., 2003; 12820457, Guidoboni et al., 2001; 11438476, Gryfe et al., 2000; 10631274, Sinicrope et al., 2006; 16952542, Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Laghi and Malesci, 2012; 22722556). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60). For patients with chemotherapy_refractory microsatellite_stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), a Phase 3 trial reported no OS advantage from the combination of the PD_L1 inhibitor atezolizumab plus cobimetinib relative to regorafenib (8.9 vs. 8.5 months, HR=1.00); atezolizumab monotherapy similarly did not prolong OS (7.1 vs. 8.5 months, HR=1.19) (Ciardiello et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract LBA_004). For patients with MSS CRC, a Phase 2 study combining ipilimumab and nivolumab reported an overall DCR of 25% (10/40) (Parikh et al., 2021; DOI: 10.1038/s43018_021_00269_7). Two Phase 1 studies for patients with MSS CRC treated with regorafenib and nivolumab reported PFSs of 7.9 months (Fukuoka et al., 2020; 32343640) and 5.7 months (Kim et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1016/j.annonc.2020.04.073), and a patient with MSS CRC refractory to chemotherapy treated with the PD_1 inhibitor sintilimab and regorafenib reported a CR (Zhang et al., 2021; 34688262). MSI has not been found to be a predictive biomarker for combination chemotherapy regimens, including FOLFOX (Sinicrope et al., 2013; 24019539, Gavin et al., 2012; 23045248) and FOLFIRI (Bertagnolli et al., 2009; 19273709, Van Cutsem et al., 2009; 19451425). Patients with MSS CRC are more likely to benefit from postsurgical fluorouracil (FU)_based adjuvant therapy (Ribic et al., 2003; 12867608, Sargent et al., 2010; 20498393) but less likely to benefit from irinotecan chemotherapy (Fallik et al., 2003; 14522894).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "NRAS", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "wildtype", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "wildtype"}}, "Interpretation": "NRAS encodes a member of the RAS family of small GTPases that mediate transduction of growth signals.

No alterations in NRAS were identified in this case. The majority of colorectal cancers (CRCs) (91_98%) have been reported to lack NRAS mutations (Pentheroudakis et al., 2013; 23374602, Vaughn et al., 2011; 21305640, Janku et al., 2013; 23400451, De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739, Irahara et al., 2010; 20736745, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Schirripa et al., 2015; 24806288, Guo et al., 2018; 29666387).

Therefore, these agents are indicated to treat patients with CRC lacking such mutations (NCCN Guidelines v1.2022). Based on clinical data, it is unclear whether the presence of PIK3CA mutations is associated with reduced sensitivity to cetuximab in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).

A study comparing PIK3CA exon 9 and 20 mutations reported that for patients with chemotherapy_refractory CRC, PIK3CA exon 20 mutations were associated with less benefit from cetuximab compared with PIK3CA wildtype (ORR of 0.0% [0/9] vs. 37% [121/329], PFS of 11.5 vs. 24 weeks, and OS of 34 vs. 51 weeks); this effect was not observed with PIK3CA exon 9 mutations (ORR of 29% [6/21] vs. 36% [115/317], PFS of 23.5 vs. 24 weeks, and OS of 46 vs. 51 weeks) (De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739).

In the Phase 3 ASPECCT study, panitumumab was found to be non_inferior to cetuximab with respect to median OS (10.4 vs. 10.0 months, HR=0.97) for patients with previously treated KRAS exon 2 wildtype metastatic colorectal cancer; median PFS was also similar between the two treatment groups (4.4 vs. 4.1 months, HR=1.00)(Price et al., 2014; 24739896). In a similar patient population, a Phase 2 study of combination panitumumab and irinotecan versus combination cetuximab and irinotecan also demonstrated non_inferiority with respect to median PFS (5.4 vs. 4.3 months, HR = 0.64) and median OS (14.9 vs. 11.5 months, HR=0.66)(Sakai et al., 2020; 32526634). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Resistant", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Panitumumab", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Panitumumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets EGFR.

The Phase 3 PARADIGM trial comparing panitumumab plus mFOLFOX6 versus bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6 as first_line treatment for patients with RAS_wildtype left_sided metastatic CRC demonstrated that treatment with panitumumab significantly improved median OS (mOS; 36.2 months vs. 31.3 months) compared with bevacizumab (Yoshino et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract LBA1). A Phase 2 trial reported that, for patients with unresectable RAS_wildtype colorectal adenocarcinoma treated with panitumumab plus FOLFOX4, maintenance with a combination of panitumumab plus fluorouracil and leucovorin was superior to panitumumab monotherapy (10_month PFS OF 59% vs. 49%)(Pietrantonio et al., 2019; 31268481). In the Phase 3 ASPECCT study, panitumumab was found to be non_inferior to cetuximab with respect to median OS (10.4 vs. 10.0 months, HR=0.97) for patients with previously treated KRAS exon 2 wildtype metastatic colorectal cancer; median PFS was also similar between the two treatment groups (4.4 vs. 4.1 months, HR=1.00)(Price et al., 2014; 24739896).

SMAD4 alterations that result in loss or disruption of the MH1 domain (aa 18_142), MH2 domain (aa 323_552), or SAD domain (aa 275_320) are predicted to be inactivating (Massague et al., 2005; 16322555, Mor\u00e9n et al., 2000; 10980615, Xu and Attisano, 2000; 10781087, Luo et al., 1999; 10485843, Jones and Kern, 2000; 10871368, Fink et al., 2001; 11196171, De Bosscher et al., 2004; 14715079, Shi et al., 1997; 9214508, Miyaki et al., 1999; 10340381, Prokova et al., 2007; 17994767, Wu et al., 2001; 11274206, Ding et al., 2009; 19139564, Kuang et al., 2004; 14647410, Watanabe et al., 2000; 11265759, Bosscher et al., 2004; 14715079). SMAD4 mutation or homozygous deletion is most frequently observed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (43%)(cBio_Witkiewicz et al., 2015; 25855536), pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (26%)(Jiao et al., 2014; 24293293), cholangiocarcinoma (25%)(Churi et al., 2014; 25536104), small intestine cancer (20%) (Takeda et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 642), appendiceal adenocarcinoma (14_20% mutation; 57% deletion)(Liu et al., 2014; 24821835, Maru et al., 2004; 14647445), colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC; 14%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696), esophageal adenocarcinoma (14%)(Wang et al., 2015; 26336083), and stomach adenocarcinoma (13%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317). In preclinical studies, SMAD4 loss of function has been implicated in the development of mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas, including mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN)(Izeradjene et al., 2007; 17349581) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN)(Bardeesy et al., 2006; 17114584); in clinical samples, SMAD4 homozygous deletion has been observed in 10% of IPMNs and 8% of MCNs, and mutation was also observed in 5% of IPMNs (Springer et al., 2015; 26253305). SMAD4 gene alterations have been associated with reduced overall survival for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Blackford et al., 2009; 19584151). Reduced SMAD4 expression has been associated with worse prognosis in various cancer types, including CRC (Yan et al., 2016; 26861460, Kozak et al., 2015; 25681512, Roth et al., 2012; 23104212), appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (Davison et al., 2014; 24618609), gastric adenocarcinoma (Kim et al., 2004; 15033661, Xiangming et al., 2001; 11234879), esophageal adenocarcinoma (Singhi et al., 2015; 25634752), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Natsugoe et al., 2002; 12060625), breast cancer (de Kruijf et al., 2013; 23022998), and prostate cancer (Shipitsin et al., 2014; 25032733). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in SMAD4. Preclinical studies in colorectal cancer have reported associations of SMAD4 inactivation or loss with sensitivity to inhibitors of Aurora kinase A (Shi et al., 2022; 35393542) and the Wnt/beta_catenin pathway (Park et al., 2022; 35274815). Clinical studies have reported associations of SMAD4 loss or low SMAD4 expression with improved responses to chemotherapeutic agents in patients with pancreatic cancer (Ormanns et al., 2017; 28534865, Fei et al., 2021; 34002944, Bachet et al., 2012; 22377565) and non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Ziemke et al., 2017; 28577946). Other clinical studies in pancreatic cancer have reported an association of high SMAD4 expression with better responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Kassardjian and Wang, 2020; 32897998) and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (Pen et al., 2021; 33667587). One or more of the SMAD4 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with juvenile polyposis syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline SMAD4 mutations, including those at the R361 hotspot, have been observed in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome (Houlston et al., 1998; 9811934, Woodford_Richens et al., 2000; 10764709, Howe et al., 2004; 15235019, Howe et al., 2004; 15235019, Howe et al., 2004; 15235019), which is associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal cancers (Brosens et al., 2011; 22171123). The penetrance of deleterious SMAD4 mutations in patients with colon cancer is estimated at 20% by age 35 and 70% by age 65 (Kalia et al., 2017; 27854360).

TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Fabrizio et al., 2018; 30151257, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526). Elevated tumor mutational burden (TMB) has been reported in 8_25% of colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (George et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3587, Nagahashi et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e15103, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117, Shao et al., 2020; 33119110). Multiple studies have reported that up to 90% of hypermutated CRC cases exhibit high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI_H) and mismatch repair deficiency (MMR_D) (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). Increased TMB is significantly associated with MSI_H and MMR_D, with studies reporting that 100% of MSI_H CRCs harbor elevated TMB and conversely that 100% of tumors with low TMB harbor intact MMR (George et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3587, Nagahashi et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e15103, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). A subset of CRCs that harbor increased TMB but not MSI_H are driven by mutations in POLE, which leads to an \u201cultramutated\u201d phenotype with especially high TMB (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). Tumors with increased TMB harbor BRAF V600E mutations more frequently than those with low TMB (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117), whereas TMB_low tumors more frequently harbor mutations in TP53 and APC (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696). The prognostic value of tumor mutational burden (TMB) in colorectal cancer (CRC) is context_ and therapy_dependent. A study of tissue TMB (tTMB) in 145 CRC samples showed longer OS in TMB_high samples compared with TMB_low ones (Schwartz et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 572). Similarly, for patients with metastatic CRC treated with first_line chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab or cetuximab, high tissue TMB (tTMB_H) was associated with longer OS (Innocenti et al., 2019; 30865548). For patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, tTMB_H was associated with better 5_year relapse_free survival (Lee et al., 2019; 31285374). However, for patients with EGFR/BRAF_inhibitor_treated, BRAF_mutated microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic CRC, intermediate tTMB was associated with significantly poorer PFS and OS compared with TMB_low status; patients with primary resistance to EGFR/BRAF blockage had higher TMB than those sensitive to these therapies (Randon et al., 2022; 34933155). In a study for 61 patients with metastatic, MSS CRC treated with best standard of care, plasma TMB scores \u226528 Muts/Mb (approximately 14 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) were associated with reduced OS compared with plasma TMB scores <28 Muts/Mb (3.0 vs. 5.3 months, HR=0.76, p=0.007), whereas tTMB was not found to be prognostic in this population (Chen et al., 2020; 32379280, Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, increased tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Ott et al., 2019; 30557521, Cristescu et al., 2022; 35101941, Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). In the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors, significant improvement in ORR was observed for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) compared with those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526); similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). At the same TMB cutpoint, retrospective analysis of patients with solid tumors treated with any checkpoint inhibitor identified that tissue TMB scores \u2265 10 Muts/Mb were associated with prolonged time to treatment failure compared with scores <10 muts/Mb (HR=0.68) (Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). For patients with solid tumors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the CheckMate 848 trial, improved responses were observed in patients with a tissue TMB \u2265 10 Muts/Mb independent of blood TMB at any cutpoint in matched samples (Schenker at al., 2022; AACR Abstract 7845). However, support for higher TMB thresholds and efficacy was observed in the prospective Phase 2 MyPathway trial of atezolizumab for patients with pan_solid tumors, where improved ORR and DCR was seen in patients with TMB \u2265 16 Muts/Mb than those with TMB \u2265 10 and <16 Muts/Mb (Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409). Similarly, analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386). In CRC specifically, a retrospective analysis of immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy reported significantly improved OS for patients with tumors harboring TMB \u22659.8 Muts/MB compared with those with tumors with TMB <9.8 Muts/Mb (~ equivalency <12 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254). Another retrospective study reported that a TMB \u226512 Muts/Mb cutoff identifies >99% of MSI_High CRC cases but only 3% of MSS cases, indicating the utility of this cutoff for identification of patients with CRC likely to benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Fabrizio et al., 2018; 30151257).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "APC", "Alteration": "R1450*", "Title": "A Study of E7386 in Combination With Other Anticancer Drug in Participants With Solid Tumor", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "CBP, Beta_catenin, FGFRs, RET, PDGFRA, VEGFRs, KIT", "Locations": "Kurume (Japan), Matsuyama (Japan), Osakasayama (Japan), Nagoya (Japan), Chuo_Ku (Japan), Chiba (Japan), Kashiwa (Japan)", "NCTID": "NCT04008797", "Note": "Based on preclinical and limited clinical data, APC inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to CBP/beta_catenin interaction inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "APC", "Alteration": "R1450*", "Title": "A Study of E7386 in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Previously Treated Participants With Selected Solid Tumors", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1/2", "Target": "CBP, Beta_catenin, PD_1", "Locations": "Osaka (Japan), Tokyo (Japan), Chiba_shi (Japan), Kashiwa (Japan), California", "NCTID": "NCT05091346", "Note": "Based on preclinical and limited clinical data, APC inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to CBP/beta_catenin interaction inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "APC", "Alteration": "R1450*", "Title": "Study of E7386 in Participants With Selected Advanced Neoplasms", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "CBP, Beta_catenin", "Locations": "Glasgow (United Kingdom), Manchester (United Kingdom), Sutton (United Kingdom)", "NCTID": "NCT03264664", "Note": "Based on preclinical and limited clinical data, APC inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to CBP/beta_catenin interaction inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "KRAS", "Alteration": "G12V", "Title": "DAY101 Monotherapy or in Combination With Other Therapies for Patients With Solid Tumors", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1/2", "Target": "BRAF, MEK", "Locations": "Busan (Korea, Republic of), Seoul (Korea, Republic of), Oregon, Barcelona (Spain), Madrid (Spain), California, Colorado, Toronto (Canada), Indiana", "NCTID": "NCT04985604", "Note": "KRAS activating mutations or amplification may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of MAPK pathway components, including MEK inhibitors.
