FGFR3 fusions that retain the kinase domain (exons 11_17) have been shown to be activating and oncogenic (Singh et al., 2012; 22837387, Nakanishi et al., 2015; 25589496). Additionally, fusions that disrupt a binding site of the regulatory microRNA miR_99a in the FGFR3 3\u2019 UTR have been demonstrated to increase FGFR3 expression (Parker et al., 2013; 23298836). Rearrangements that include the N_terminal portion of FGFR3 (exons 1_17), such as observed here, are predicted to be activating and oncogenic. FGFR3 V555L has been shown to reduce sensitivity to infigratinib in a preclinical study; however, V555L has not been fully characterized and therefore the effects of this mutation on FGFR3 activity are unclear (Goyal et al., 2016; 28034880). FGFR3 mutation and amplification have been reported in 26_59% and 18% of bladder urothelial carcinoma cases, respectively (van Oers et al., 2009; 18584939, Gust et al., 2013; 23657946, Dodurga et al., 2011; 21264819, The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014; 24476821). FGFR3 mutations are detected more frequently in upper tract urothelial carcinoma (26_40%) compared to bladder urothelial carcinoma (19_26%) (Necchi et al., 2020; 32861617, Audenet et al., 2018; 30352907, Sfakianos et al., 2015; 26278805). S249C has been reported to be the most frequent FGFR3 mutation in urothelial tumors, with similar incidences of 62% and 58% in bladder tumors and upper urothelial tract tumors, respectively (van Oers et al., 2009; 18584939). FGFR3 and TP53 have been reported to be the most frequently mutated genes in bladder cancer, and it has been suggested that urothelial carcinomas develop through at least two molecular pathways: one related to FGFR3, typically in less invasive tumors, and one related to TP53, characterized by higher grade invasive tumors (Wu, 2005; 16110317). FGFR3 expression has been found in 70% of bladder urothelial carcinomas, with high expression in 36% and 22% of low_grade and high_grade samples, respectively (Gust et al., 2013; 23657946). FGFR3 mutation has been associated by univariate analysis with low tumor stage in bladder tumors and with a lower risk of death for patients with bladder tumors; in multivariate analysis, FGFR3 mutations were associated with lower risk only in ureter tumors (van Oers et al., 2009; 18584939). For patients with non_muscle_invasive bladder cancer, a meta_analysis of 62 studies reported that FGFR3 mutation was associated with worse recurrence_free survival but better PFS (Parizi et al., 2021; 33642228). In another study of metastatic urothelial cancer cases, FGFR2 or FGFR3 mutations or fusions were associated with significantly worse OS outcomes (n=77) (Sevillano et al., 2022; ASCO GU Abstract 537). For muscle_invasive bladder cancer, a study of samples across multiple datasets reported that FGFR3 pathway activation was associated with luminal_papillary subtypes and with better OS outcomes than other subtypes (De Jong et al., 2019; 31619281); a second meta_analysis also associated muscle_invasive bladder and upper urinary tract tumors with better prognosis (Parizi et al., 2021; 33642228). Alterations that activate FGFR3 may predict sensitivity to selective FGFR kinase inhibitors, including erdafitinib (Loriot et al., 2019; 31340094, Tabernero et al., 2015; 26324363, Karkera et al., 2017; 28416604, Park et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 4117), pemigatinib (Necchi et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 900P, Subbiah et al., 2022; 35176457), infigratinib (Pal et al., 2018; 29848605, Pal et al., 2020; 32208524), rogaratinib (Schuler et al., 2019; 31405822), Debio 1347 (Nakanishi et al., 2015; 25589496, Voss et al., 2019; 30745300), and derazantinib (Papadopoulos et al., 2017; 28972963); multikinase inhibitors such as pazopanib (Bellmunt et al., 2018; 30220708, Palma et al., 2015; 25766722) and ponatinib (Gozgit et al., 2012; 22238366, Liao et al., 2013; 23786770); and vofatamab, an antibody targeting FGFR3 (Bellmunt et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 4534, Necchi et al., 2019; ASCO GU Abstract 409, Siefker_Radtke et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 4511). A study of the tumor immune microenvironment in urothelial bladder cancer found enhanced FGFR3 pathway activation in non_T_cell_inflamed tumors compared with T_cell_inflamed tumors, suggesting that FGFR3_altered tumors may be resistant to immunotherapy (Sweis et al., 2016; 27197067). However, clinical data from the IMvigor_210/211, CheckMate_275, and PURE_01 studies have not reported statistically significant associations between FGFR3 status and response to PD_1/PD_L1 inhibition (Wang et al., 2019; 31272788, Necchi et al., 2020; 32417369). Phase 2 studies have shown activity of erdafitinib, pemigatinib, and infigratinib in FGFR3_altered urothelial carcinoma, with ORRs ranging from 25_40% (Loriot et al., 2019; 31340094, Necchi et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 900P, Pal et al., 2018; 29848605, Pal et al., 2020; 32208524, Subbiah et al., 2022; 35176457). Early analysis of the Phase 2 FIERCE_21 study for patients with pretreated urothelial carcinoma harboring FGFR3 mutations or fusions showed better median PFS when vofatamab was combined with docetaxel relative to vofatamab alone (not reached vs. 4 months) (Necchi et al., 2019; ASCO GU Abstract 409). Interim analysis of the Phase 2 FIERCE_22 trial evaluating vofatamab combined with pembrolizumab for patients with pretreated urothelial cancer reported an ORR of 36% (8/22), with responses observed for 33% (5/15) and 43% (3/7) of patients with wildtype or mutated and/or rearranged FGFR3, respectively (Siefker_Radtke et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 4511). In a Phase 1 study, rogaratinib elicited an ORR of 24% (12/51, 1 CR) and a DCR of 73% (37/51) in advanced urothelial carcinoma with FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGFR3 mRNA overexpression (Schuler et al., 2019; 31405822).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "FGFR inhibitors may be relevant in tumors with alterations that activate FGFR3.

Pemigatinib has been primarily studied in the treatment of FGFR2_rearranged cholangiocarcinoma.

Phase 2 studies have shown activity of erdafitinib, pemigatinib, and infigratinib in FGFR3_altered urothelial carcinoma, with ORRs ranging from 25_40% (Loriot et al., 2019; 31340094, Necchi et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 900P, Pal et al., 2018; 29848605, Pal et al., 2020; 32208524, Subbiah et al., 2022; 35176457). Early analysis of the Phase 2 FIERCE_21 study for patients with pretreated urothelial carcinoma harboring FGFR3 mutations or fusions showed better median PFS when vofatamab was combined with docetaxel relative to vofatamab alone (not reached vs. 4 months) (Necchi et al., 2019; ASCO GU Abstract 409). Interim analysis of the Phase 2 FIERCE_22 trial evaluating vofatamab combined with pembrolizumab for patients with pretreated urothelial cancer reported an ORR of 36% (8/22), with responses observed for 33% (5/15) and 43% (3/7) of patients with wildtype or mutated and/or rearranged FGFR3, respectively (Siefker_Radtke et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 4511). In a Phase 1 study, rogaratinib elicited an ORR of 24% (12/51, 1 CR) and a DCR of 73% (37/51) in advanced urothelial carcinoma with FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGFR3 mRNA overexpression (Schuler et al., 2019; 31405822).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "FGFR inhibitors may be relevant in tumors with alterations that activate FGFR3.

Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. NF2 mutation has been observed in 0_3% of urothelial carcinomas (cBio_Robertson et al., 2017; 28988769, cBio_Van Allen et al., 2014; 25096233, cBio_Guo et al., 2013; 24121792, Sfakianos et al., 2015; 26278805). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of NF2 alterations in urothelial carcinoma are limited (PubMed, Mar 2023). NF2 inactivating alterations may indicate sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors (Lopez_Lago et al., 2009; 19451229, James et al., 2009; 19451225, Pachow et al., 2013; 23406776, Iyer et al., 2012; 22923433).

Loss or inactivation of NF2 may also predict sensitivity to FAK inhibitors based on clinical data in mesothelioma (Soria et al., 2016; 27733373) and meningioma (Brastianos et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 2502) and strong preclinical data (Poulikakos et al., 2006; 16652148, Shapiro et al., 2014; 24848258, Shah et al., 2014; 24786638). Limited preclinical and clinical evidence in vestibular schwannoma suggests possible sensitivity of NF2_deficient tumors to the pan_ERBB inhibitor lapatinib (Ammoun et al., 2010; 20511180, Karajannis et al., 2012; 22844108). Similarly, on the basis of limited clinical (Subbiah et al., 2011; ASCO Abstract 2100) and preclinical (Garcia_Rendueles et al., 2015; 26359368, Ammoun et al., 2008; 18593924, Yi et al., 2011; 21481793) evidence, NF2 inactivation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, such as approved agents trametinib and cobimetinib. These and other relevant compounds are being investigated in clinical trials. Whereas frequent adverse events precluded a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for the combination of trametinib and everolimus in a Phase 1b trial for solid tumors (Tolcher et al., 2014; 25344362), a retrospective study for heavily pretreated patients with solid tumors reported tolerable regimens of the combination for 23/31 patients, with 16 patients treated >3 months and evaluable patients achieving a median PFS of 6.5 months (Patterson et al., 2018; AACR Abstract 3891).

High bTMB levels were not detected in this sample. It is unclear whether the bTMB levels in this sample would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Depending on the clinical context, TMB testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. Average bTMB levels in solid tumors other than NSCLC have not been evaluated (PubMed, Mar 2023). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of bTMB levels in bladder cancer are limited (PubMed, Jul 2022). One study reported that the number of somatic mutations positively correlates with increased tumor stage and grade of bladder cancers (Cazier et al., 2016; 24777035). For patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma receiving atezolizumab, however, higher median mutation load has been reported to be significantly associated with improved PFS and OS (Rosenberg et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 104, Rosenberg et al., 2016; 26952546, Balar et al., 2017; 27939400). Another study for patients with urothelial bladder carcinoma showed that high tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with superior OS and disease_specific survival compared with low TMB; the OS benefit of high TMB was driven by the cohort with Stage 3 disease, whereas OS was similar between low and high TMB for patients with Stage 2 or Stage 4 disease (Voutsadakis, 2022; 35323317). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB) may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716), anti_PD_1 (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716), anti_PD_1/CTLA4 therapies (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P), anti_PD_L1/CTLA4 therapies (Chen et al., 2020; 32379280, Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511, Rizvi et al., 2020; 32271377, Si et al., 2021; 33355200, Leighl et al., 2022; 34800700). A Phase 2 multi_solid_tumor trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022). In non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single_agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 Muts/Mb_16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2020; 32271377, Si et al., 2021; 33355200, Leighl et al., 2022; 34800700). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511). In colorectal cancer (CRC), a Phase 2 study showed that bTMB TMB \u226528 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u226514 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved OS from a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61, Chen et al., 2020; 32379280).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Cannot Be Determined", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Cannot Be Determined"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI has been detected in 26_49% of urothelial carcinomas (Mylona et al., 2008; 18254781, Amira et al., 2003; 14501713); MSI_H has also been reported in multiple case studies of upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (Bai et al., 2013; 23690119). Microsatellite instability (MSI), as determined through loss of MSH2 or MSH6 protein expression, correlated with noninvasive well_differentiated bladder tumors and favorable OS (Mylona et al., 2008; 18254781). On the basis of clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD_1_targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Shitara et al., 2022; 35322232, Andre et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 244, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143), as well as PD_L1_targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (alone or in combination with tremelimumab) (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92, Pietrantonio et al., 2023; ASCO GI Abstract 358, Lee et al., 2023; ASCO GI abstract 401, Rubinstein et al., 2022; 36512912, Marie et al., 2021; 33811152).

TP53 mutation has been reported in 49\u201354% of bladder urothelial carcinoma (UC) (Ross et al., 2013; 23887298, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014; 24476821), 33% of renal pelvis UC (Bringuier et al., 1998; 9761125), and 25% (22/71) of ureter UC samples (Furihata et al., 2000; 10675480). Expression of p53 has been correlated with TP53 mutation, and reported in 52\u201384% of bladder cancers (Esrig et al., 1993; 7901994, Cordon_Cardo et al., 1994; 7906253, Diaz_Cano et al., 2000; 10744064, Kapur et al., 2011; 21571954, Lotan et al., 2013; 23571005, Kim et al., 2014; 25092538), 48% (24/50) bladder SCCs (El_Kenawy et al., 2003; 14756544), 36\u201353% of upper urinary tract UCs (UTUC) (Joung et al., 2008; 18931548, Jinza et al., 1998; 9644783, Kamijima et al., 2005; 16351648), and in 4/4 urethral clear cell carcinomas (Alexiev et al., 2013; 23307189). TP53 mutations in both bladder and renal pelvis urothelial carcinoma (UC) are more common in invasive tumors (Bringuier et al., 1998; 9761125, Goebell and Knowles, 2010; 20610279, Lindgren et al., 2012; 22685613, Kim et al., 2014; 25092538), and have been associated with inferior survival in patients with renal pelvis UC (Bringuier et al., 1998; 9761125) or upper tract UC (UTUC) (Feng et al., 2014; 24500328). Alterations to the p53 pathway are correlated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in bladder cancer (Eissa et al., 2010; 20012564, Mitra et al., 2007; 17710407, Lambrou et al., 2013; 23624844), and p53 overexpression has been linked to poor progression_free survival in UTUC (Lee et al., 2013; 23482786, Feng et al., 2014; 24500328), disease progression in UC of the renal pelvis and ureter (Hashimoto et al., 2000; 11168685), and higher tumor grade in bladder squamous cell carcinoma (Osman et al., 1997; 9815716, Helal et al., 2006; 16998598, Jalali et al., 2011; 22126554). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with elevated tumor fraction have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus high sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at low risk of false negative results. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels. In the research setting, changes in tumor fraction estimates have been associated with treatment duration and clinical response and may be a useful indicator for future cancer management (Bronkhorst et al., 2019; 30923679, Raja et al., 2018; 30093454, Hrebien et al., 2019; 30860573, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5039, Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Goodall et al., 2017; 28450425, Goldberg et al., 2018; 29330207).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "FGFR3", "Alteration": "V555LFGFR3_TACC3 fusion", "Title": "A Study of Erdafitinib Compared With Vinflunine or Docetaxel or Pembrolizumab in Participants With Advanced Urothelial Cancer and Selected Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) Gene Aberrations", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 3", "Target": "PD_1, FGFRs", "Locations": "Taipei (Taiwan), Taoyuan (Taiwan), Taichung (Taiwan), Tainan (Taiwan), Niao_Sung Hsiang (Taiwan), Kaohsiung (Taiwan), Wenzhou (China), Hangzhou (China), ShangHai (China), Shanghai (China)", "NCTID": "NCT03390504", "Note": "FGFR inhibitors may be relevant in tumors with alterations that activate FGFR3.
