The BARD1 ANK repeats and BRCT motifs play important roles in chromosome stability, and both these regions and the RING domain are necessary for homology_directed repair (Laufer et al., 2007; 17848578, Wu et al., 2015; 25634209, Westermark et al., 2003; 14560035). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt BARD1 function or expression. BARD1 mutations have been reported in fewer than 1% of low_grade glioma and glioblastoma samples across several genomic studies (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890, Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of BARD1 alterations in gliomas and astrocytomas are limited (PubMed, Oct 2021). Clinical benefit from rucaparib has been observed in a patient with BARD1_mutated ovarian cancer (O Malley et al., 2017; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract LB_A12). On the basis of preclinical evidence, tumors with BARD1 inactivation may be sensitive to PARP inhibitors (Wu et al., 2015; 25634209, Wang et al., 2016; 27454289, Ozden et al., 2016; 27197561, Nguyen et al., 2017; AACR Abstract 2476, Zhao et al., 2017; 28976962).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Tumors with BARD1 inactivating mutation or loss may be sensitive to PARP inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04123366", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03742895", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02264678", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04715620", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05035745", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03772561", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04614909", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02484404", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02769962", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "EGFR", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": [{"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "EGFR encodes the epidermal growth factor receptor, which belongs to a class of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases. In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). Amplification of EGFR has been associated with increased expression of EGFR mRNA and protein in several cancer types (Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Bhargava et al., 2005; 15920544, Yang et al., 2012; 22490401). A mutation of the EGFR gene, referred to as EGFRvIII, results from a gene rearrangement that deletes exons 2_7. This alteration causes an in_frame deletion of 801 base pairs encoding part of the extracellular ligand_binding domain (Nishikawa et al., 1994; 8052651). This deletion has shown to result in ligand_independent (constitutive) phosphorylation and activation of EGFR, as well as consequent tumorigenesis (Nishikawa et al., 1994; 8052651, Nedergaard et al., 2012; 22385404). Across several genomic studies of CNS tumors, EGFR amplification has been reported in 16.9% of anaplastic astrocytomas, and 39.7% of glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs)(Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031, Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509). EGFR alterations have been reported in 13.2% of anaplastic astrocytomas, 5.3_15.9% of glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs), and 0% of pilocytic astrocytomas in several genomic studies of CNS tumors (cbio_Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031, cbio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, cbio_Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, cbio_Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509). In GBMs, Missense mutations in the EGFR extracellular domain have been found in 10_15% of cases and approximately half have a low_level amplification of the mutated allele (Lee et al., 2006; 17177598, Vivanco et al., 2012; 22588883). In a study of IDH_wildtype GBM samples, EGFR alterations were detected in 50% (117/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed, including 41% (95/232) with a co_occurring EGFR amplification and mutation, 26% (61/232) with an EGFR domain truncation event, such as EGFRvIII, and 2.2% (5/232) with an EGFR fusion event (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). The EGFRvIII mutation has been variously reported in 6_46% of GBM samples (Nishikawa et al., 1994; 8052651, Shinojima et al., 2003; 14583498, Nishikawa et al., 2004; 15700833, Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176, Viana_Pereira et al., 2008; 18507036, Yoshimoto et al., 2008; 18223223, Larysz et al., 2011; 21455841, Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251, Lv et al., 2012; 22752145). No definitive correlation has been identified between EGFR amplification and length of survival in patients with GBM (Srividya et al., 2010; 20702468, Das et al., 2011; 20888234); however, EGFR amplification has been associated with prolonged survival in patients over the age of 60 with GBM (Smith et al., 2001; 11504770). The link between EGFRvIII status and prognosis is unclear, although some studies suggest that it may be linked to improved survival and response to chemotherapy (Montano et al., 2011; 22241957). In multiple glioblastoma (GBM) studies, the presence of EGFRvIII has not predicted clinical benefit from first_generation EGFR TKIs such as erlotinib (Van den Bent et al., 2009; 19204207, Haas_Kogen et al., 2005; 15956649, Brown et al., 2008; 18955445, Preusser et al., 2008; 18458820, Wen et al., 2014; 24470557, Gallego et al., 2013; 24352766) or gefitinib (Rich et al. 2004; 14638850, Uhm et al., 2011; 20510539, Preusser et al., 2008; 18458820). However, case reports have described patients with EGFRvIII_positive GBM responding to erlotinib (Doyle et al., 2018; 30410775, D Alessandris et al., 2013; 23132371, Custodio and Perez_Segura, 2010; 20462843, D Alessandris et al., 2018; 30306271). In a retrospective study of patients with GBM treated with erlotinib or gefitinib, co_expression of EGFRvIII with PTEN protein was the strongest predictor of response (P<0.001)(Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176), suggesting that activity in this setting is dependent on PTEN status (Mellinghoff et al., 2007; 17255257, Arif et al., 2018; 29492119). However, a prospective Phase 2 trial testing erlotinib monotherapy for patients with EGFRvIII and PTEN_positive recurrent glioblastoma reported minimal efficacy and was terminated (Gallego et al., 2013; 24352766). The second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib have shown minimal efficacy for patients with EGFRvIII glioblastoma (GBM)(Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Alshami et al., 2015; 26423602, Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). A Phase 1/2 study of afatinib, temozolomide, or the combination for patients with GBM reported clinical benefit, including for patients with EGFRvIII; however, temozolomide alone and in combination exhibited better responses than afatinib monotherapy (Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Alshami et al., 2015; 26423602). A Phase 2 trial of dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified GBM reported a DCR of 26% (5/19) among patients with EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII; however, the trial failed to meet its primary endpoint of 6_month PFS (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464). A retrospective biomarker analysis of another Phase 2 study of dacomitinib for patients with GBM found no association between EGFRvIII and clinical benefit (Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). A patient with multiple glioblastoma (GBM) tumors, one of which harbored EGFRvIII, experienced progression of the EGFRvIII_positive tumor during treatment with osimertinib (Makhlin et al., 2019; 31769726). Novel approaches that specifically target EGFRvIII in glioblastoma (GBM), such as the vaccine rindopepimut, are under investigation in both clinical and preclinical studies. A Phase 2 trial reported significant improvement in OS for patients with EGFRvIII_positive GBM with rindopepimut in combination with bevacizumab compared to bevacizumab alone (HR=0.53, p=0.01)(Reardon et al., 2020; 32034072). However, a Phase 3 study of rindopepimut combined with temozolomide compared to temozolomide alone in newly diagnosed EGFRvIII_positive GBM patients was terminated after the interim analysis, due to a lack of clinical benefit as measured by OS (20 vs. 20 months)(Weller et al., 2017; 28844499). Clinical studies of the second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified gliomas have shown limited efficacy (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Blumenthal et al., 2016; 27531351); however, a small subset of patients has experienced clinical benefit (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). Multiple studies have failed to find a positive association between increased EGFR expression and clinical benefit from erlotinib or gefitinib for patients with glioblastoma (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176, Franceschi et al., 2007; 17353924, Chakravarti et al., 2013; 23182702, Hegi et al., 2011; 21471286, Rich et al. 2004; 14638850). There are conflicting data on the efficacy of anti_EGFR antibodies for the treatment of EGFR_amplified tumors. A meta_analysis of colorectal cancer patients treated with second_line or higher cetuximab or panitumumab observed an association between EGFR copy number gain and increased OS and PFS (Jiang et al., 2013; 23441167). However, studies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cancer found either no association or a negative association between EGFR copy number gain and survival after treatment with first_line cetuximab or panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy (Licitra et al., 2011; 21048039, Smyth et al., 2020; 33199443). The Phase 3 INTELLANCE trial of depatuxizumab mafodotin (ABT_414), an EGFR_targeted antibody_drug conjugate with a toxic payload, in patients with EGFR_amplified glioblastoma (GBM) was stopped for futility. Interim analysis demonstrated improved median PFS (mPFS) of ABT_414 monotherapy compared with placebo (HR=0.84); however, no OS benefit was observed (HR=1.01). Improved mPFS was also observed in patients harboring EGFRvIII (HR=0.73) but without an OS improvement (HR=0.95) (Lassman et al., 2019; Neuro_Oncology Abstract ACTR_21). The Phase 2 INTELLANCE trial demonstrated clinical benefit for EGFR_amplified GBM for the combination of ABT_414, temozolomide, and radiotherapy (HR=0.66, p=0.017), but there was no evidence of efficacy for ABT_414 monotherapy (HR=1.04, p=0.83)(Bent et al., 2020; 31747009). The presence of EGFR gene amplification or TERT promoter mutations are indicative of diffuse astrocytic glioma with molecular features of glioblastoma, WHO grade 4 in IDH1/2_wildtype tumors (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021) (Louis et al., 2021; 34185076).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

In preclinical trials, cetuximab, matuzumab, and panitumumab were reported to be ineffective at blocking EGFR dimerization and activation in GBM cells expressing EGFR extracellular domain mutations (Gajadhar et al., 2012; 22232519). However, another study demonstrated that in patients with GBM harboring EGFR amplification but lacking expression of the EGFRvIII variant, treatment with cetuximab resulted in significantly better progression_free survival (PFS) and numerical (although not statistically significant) improvement in overall survival (OS) (Lv et al., 2012; 22752145). A Phase 3 trial of combined cetuximab and platinum/5_FU in patients with HNSCC demonstrated improved response compared to platinum/5_FU alone, but EGFR amplification was not shown to predict response to this treatment (Licitra et al., 2011; 21048039). A Phase 3 study of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma did not report any improved outcome in patients treated with a combination of cetuximab plus gemcitabine vs gemcitabine alone (Philip et al., 2010; 20606093). In a Phase 1/2 trial of 36 patients with metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with cetuximab in combination with doxorubicin, stable disease was reported in approximately 63% of patients (Slovin et al., 2009; 19815486). A Phase 1 study of the combination therapy of cetuximab, erlotinib, and bevacizumab reported stable disease in 21% (7/34) of patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Falchook et al., 2013; 23435217). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Panitumumab", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Panitumumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets EGFR.

Panitumumab has shown efficacy as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy for patients with KRAS_wildtype colorectal cancer (Douillard et al., 2014; 24718886, Price et al., 2014; 24739896, Van Cutsem et al., 2007; 17470858) and has been investigated in a variety of other tumor types. For patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), data are conflicting; some trials of panitumumab in various lines and with different chemotherapy combinations have shown modest benefit (Vermorken et al., 2013; 23746666, Wirth et al., 2010; 19892746, Siano et al., 2017; 28592616) and others have reported no benefit (Mesia et al., 2015; 25596660, Giralt et al., 2015; 25596659, Siu et al., 2016; 27930762).

The EGFRvIII mutation has been variously reported in 6_46% of GBM samples (Nishikawa et al., 1994; 8052651, Shinojima et al., 2003; 14583498, Nishikawa et al., 2004; 15700833, Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176, Viana_Pereira et al., 2008; 18507036, Yoshimoto et al., 2008; 18223223, Larysz et al., 2011; 21455841, Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251, Lv et al., 2012; 22752145). No definitive correlation has been identified between EGFR amplification and length of survival in patients with GBM (Srividya et al., 2010; 20702468, Das et al., 2011; 20888234); however, EGFR amplification has been associated with prolonged survival in patients over the age of 60 with GBM (Smith et al., 2001; 11504770). The link between EGFRvIII status and prognosis is unclear, although some studies suggest that it may be linked to improved survival and response to chemotherapy (Montano et al., 2011; 22241957). In multiple glioblastoma (GBM) studies, the presence of EGFRvIII has not predicted clinical benefit from first_generation EGFR TKIs such as erlotinib (Van den Bent et al., 2009; 19204207, Haas_Kogen et al., 2005; 15956649, Brown et al., 2008; 18955445, Preusser et al., 2008; 18458820, Wen et al., 2014; 24470557, Gallego et al., 2013; 24352766) or gefitinib (Rich et al. 2004; 14638850, Uhm et al., 2011; 20510539, Preusser et al., 2008; 18458820). However, case reports have described patients with EGFRvIII_positive GBM responding to erlotinib (Doyle et al., 2018; 30410775, D Alessandris et al., 2013; 23132371, Custodio and Perez_Segura, 2010; 20462843, D Alessandris et al., 2018; 30306271). In a retrospective study of patients with GBM treated with erlotinib or gefitinib, co_expression of EGFRvIII with PTEN protein was the strongest predictor of response (P<0.001)(Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176), suggesting that activity in this setting is dependent on PTEN status (Mellinghoff et al., 2007; 17255257, Arif et al., 2018; 29492119). However, a prospective Phase 2 trial testing erlotinib monotherapy for patients with EGFRvIII and PTEN_positive recurrent glioblastoma reported minimal efficacy and was terminated (Gallego et al., 2013; 24352766). The second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib have shown minimal efficacy for patients with EGFRvIII glioblastoma (GBM)(Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Alshami et al., 2015; 26423602, Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). A Phase 1/2 study of afatinib, temozolomide, or the combination for patients with GBM reported clinical benefit, including for patients with EGFRvIII; however, temozolomide alone and in combination exhibited better responses than afatinib monotherapy (Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Alshami et al., 2015; 26423602). A Phase 2 trial of dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified GBM reported a DCR of 26% (5/19) among patients with EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII; however, the trial failed to meet its primary endpoint of 6_month PFS (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464). A retrospective biomarker analysis of another Phase 2 study of dacomitinib for patients with GBM found no association between EGFRvIII and clinical benefit (Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). A patient with multiple glioblastoma (GBM) tumors, one of which harbored EGFRvIII, experienced progression of the EGFRvIII_positive tumor during treatment with osimertinib (Makhlin et al., 2019; 31769726). Novel approaches that specifically target EGFRvIII in glioblastoma (GBM), such as the vaccine rindopepimut, are under investigation in both clinical and preclinical studies. A Phase 2 trial reported significant improvement in OS for patients with EGFRvIII_positive GBM with rindopepimut in combination with bevacizumab compared to bevacizumab alone (HR=0.53, p=0.01)(Reardon et al., 2020; 32034072). However, a Phase 3 study of rindopepimut combined with temozolomide compared to temozolomide alone in newly diagnosed EGFRvIII_positive GBM patients was terminated after the interim analysis, due to a lack of clinical benefit as measured by OS (20 vs. 20 months)(Weller et al., 2017; 28844499). Clinical studies of the second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified gliomas have shown limited efficacy (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Blumenthal et al., 2016; 27531351); however, a small subset of patients has experienced clinical benefit (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). Multiple studies have failed to find a positive association between increased EGFR expression and clinical benefit from erlotinib or gefitinib for patients with glioblastoma (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176, Franceschi et al., 2007; 17353924, Chakravarti et al., 2013; 23182702, Hegi et al., 2011; 21471286, Rich et al. 2004; 14638850). There are conflicting data on the efficacy of anti_EGFR antibodies for the treatment of EGFR_amplified tumors. A meta_analysis of colorectal cancer patients treated with second_line or higher cetuximab or panitumumab observed an association between EGFR copy number gain and increased OS and PFS (Jiang et al., 2013; 23441167). However, studies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cancer found either no association or a negative association between EGFR copy number gain and survival after treatment with first_line cetuximab or panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy (Licitra et al., 2011; 21048039, Smyth et al., 2020; 33199443). The Phase 3 INTELLANCE trial of depatuxizumab mafodotin (ABT_414), an EGFR_targeted antibody_drug conjugate with a toxic payload, in patients with EGFR_amplified glioblastoma (GBM) was stopped for futility. Interim analysis demonstrated improved median PFS (mPFS) of ABT_414 monotherapy compared with placebo (HR=0.84); however, no OS benefit was observed (HR=1.01). Improved mPFS was also observed in patients harboring EGFRvIII (HR=0.73) but without an OS improvement (HR=0.95) (Lassman et al., 2019; Neuro_Oncology Abstract ACTR_21). The Phase 2 INTELLANCE trial demonstrated clinical benefit for EGFR_amplified GBM for the combination of ABT_414, temozolomide, and radiotherapy (HR=0.66, p=0.017), but there was no evidence of efficacy for ABT_414 monotherapy (HR=1.04, p=0.83)(Bent et al., 2020; 31747009). The presence of EGFR gene amplification or TERT promoter mutations are indicative of diffuse astrocytic glioma with molecular features of glioblastoma, WHO grade 4 in IDH1/2_wildtype tumors (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021) (Louis et al., 2021; 34185076).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

In preclinical trials, cetuximab, matuzumab, and panitumumab were reported to be ineffective at blocking EGFR dimerization and activation in GBM cells expressing EGFR extracellular domain mutations (Gajadhar et al., 2012; 22232519). However, another study demonstrated that in patients with GBM harboring EGFR amplification but lacking expression of the EGFRvIII variant, treatment with cetuximab resulted in significantly better progression_free survival (PFS) and numerical (although not statistically significant) improvement in overall survival (OS) (Lv et al., 2012; 22752145). A Phase 3 trial of combined cetuximab and platinum/5_FU in patients with HNSCC demonstrated improved response compared to platinum/5_FU alone, but EGFR amplification was not shown to predict response to this treatment (Licitra et al., 2011; 21048039). A Phase 3 study of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma did not report any improved outcome in patients treated with a combination of cetuximab plus gemcitabine vs gemcitabine alone (Philip et al., 2010; 20606093). In a Phase 1/2 trial of 36 patients with metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with cetuximab in combination with doxorubicin, stable disease was reported in approximately 63% of patients (Slovin et al., 2009; 19815486). A Phase 1 study of the combination therapy of cetuximab, erlotinib, and bevacizumab reported stable disease in 21% (7/34) of patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Falchook et al., 2013; 23435217). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Panitumumab", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Panitumumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets EGFR.

Panitumumab has shown efficacy as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy for patients with KRAS_wildtype colorectal cancer (Douillard et al., 2014; 24718886, Price et al., 2014; 24739896, Van Cutsem et al., 2007; 17470858) and has been investigated in a variety of other tumor types. For patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), data are conflicting; some trials of panitumumab in various lines and with different chemotherapy combinations have shown modest benefit (Vermorken et al., 2013; 23746666, Wirth et al., 2010; 19892746, Siano et al., 2017; 28592616) and others have reported no benefit (Mesia et al., 2015; 25596660, Giralt et al., 2015; 25596659, Siu et al., 2016; 27930762).

Certain splice isoforms of HGF may also act as MET antagonists (Stamos et al., 2004; 15167892, Tolbert et al., 2010; 20624990). HGF plays an important role in normal development, acting as a growth factor in a number of different tissues (Stamos et al., 2004; 15167892, Tolbert et al., 2010; 20624990). HGF and its receptor, MET, have been implicated in growth, invasion, and metastasis of many solid tumors (Tolbert et al., 2010; 20624990). HGF has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210), and may be biologically relevant in this context (Zack et al., 2013; 24071852, Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). HGF amplification has been reported most frequently in esophagogastric carcinoma (2_4%), prostate carcinoma (0_5%), and mucosal melanoma (3%), but rarely in other solid tumors (cBio_Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359, Nguyen et al., 2022; 35120664). HGF expression within tumor glioma cells is associated with high_grade glioma and increased microvessels, and tumor_derived HGF expression has been shown to correlate with reduced survival time (Guo et al., 2012; 22741575). Elevated expression of HGF and MET mRNA have been reported in GBM (Garnett et al., 2013; 23359207, Kunkel et al., 2001; 11296484), and HGF expression in GBM models has been shown to be associated with responsiveness to MET inhibition (Zhang et al., 2013; 23386689). On the basis of several preclinical studies in different cancer types, high HGF gene expression may associate with sensitivity to MET_targeted therapies, such as the approved multikinase inhibitors crizotinib and cabozantinib (Zhang et al., 2013; 23386689, Xie et al., 2012; 22203985, Kentsis et al., 2012; 22683780, Qian et al., 2013; 24167653, Wanjala et al., 2015; 25381262). However, this hypothesis has not been extensively tested in clinical studies. Whereas patients with glioblastoma and high tumor HGF gene expression experienced longer survival and a higher objective response rate (5/14 vs. 0/16) on the MET_targeting antibody onartuzumab combined with the anti_VEGF antibody bevacizumab than with placebo plus bevacizumab (Cloughesy et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 2015), tumor HGF gene expression did not predict significant benefit from onartuzumab added to the EGFR_inhibitor erlotinib for patients with non_small cell lung cancer (Koeppen et al., 2014; 24687921). Anti_HGF antibodies, such as ficlatuzumab, are also under clinical investigation (Patnaik et al., 2014; 24901237, Iveson et al., 2014; 24965569). Preclinical studies have shown that increased HGF protein levels can induce resistance of EGFR_mutant lung tumors to EGFR inhibitors and of BRAF_mutant melanoma cells to RAF inhibitors; this resistance could be overcome by combination therapy with MET inhibitors (Yano et al., 2008; 19010923, Turke et al., 2010; 20129249, Nakade et al., 2014; 24828661, Nanjo et al., 2013; 24386407, Chen et al., 2013; 23962905, Straussman et al., 2012; 22763439).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "HGF amplification or activating mutations may predict sensitivity to therapeutic agents targeting its receptor, MET, or to agents directly targeting HGF.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT03175224", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04887194", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "MDM4", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "MDM4 acts as a negative regulator of p53, but a fraction of MDM4 localized to the mitochondria acts in concert with p53 to promote apoptosis (Mancini et al., 2009; 19521340). MDM4 has been reported to be amplified in cancer and therapies targeting MDM4 or MDM2 have been shown to increase levels of the tumor suppressor p53 in cancer cells (Wade et al., 2013; 23303139, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Danovi et al., 2004; 15199139, Beging et al., 2014; 24739573). In the TCGA dataset, amplification of MDM4 was observed in 8.5% of glioblastoma cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). MDM4 amplification or amplification of the 1q32.1 chromosomal locus, which encompasses MDM4 and PIK3C2B, has been frequently reported, particularly in Grade 3 and 4 astrocytoma or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cases; one study reported MDM4 amplification in 27% (23/86) of astrocytoma samples (Arjona et al., 2005; 16319692, Schiffman et al., 2010; 20068183, Nobusawa et al., 2010; 20406234, Rao et al., 2010; 19609742, Jin et al., 2010; 20472715, Riemenschneider et al., 1999; 10626796). A study also reported MDM4 amplification in 4% (4/106) of GBMs and in 4% (1/27) of anaplastic oligodendrogliomas; MDM4 amplification was not detected in any of the 56 low_grade (Grade 1 or 2) gliomas investigated (Riemenschneider et al., 1999; 10626796). The association of MDM4 amplification with tumor grade in astrocytomas is unclear (Arjona et al., 2005; 16319692, Schiffman et al., 2010; 20068183). Numerous small molecules targeting MDM4 or the MDM2_MDM4 complex, including nutlins, are in preclinical and clinical development (Vaseva et al., 2011; 21562588, Wang and Yan, 2011; 21750655, Wang et al., 2011; 21075910, Reed et al., 2010; 20080970, Smalley et al., 2007; 17210701, Vogel et al., 2012; 23035244, Mandke et al., 2012; 22870278) and have been shown to be effective against cancer cells in the presence of a wild_type p53 allele (Hirose et al., 2014; 25621298, Chang et al., 2013; 23946421, Bernal et al., 2010; 21075307, Wade et al., 2013; 23303139). However, higher MDM4 protein expression has been reported in Nutlin_3 non_responder chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients than in responder patients (Bo et al., 2010; 20507307).

Both p15INK4b and p16INK4a bind to and inhibit CDK4 and CDK6, thereby maintaining the growth_suppressive activity of the Rb tumor suppressor; loss or inactivation of either p15INK4b or p16INK4a contributes to dysregulation of the CDK4/6_cyclin_Rb pathway and loss of cell cycle control (Gazzeri et al., 1998; 9484839, Roussel, 1999; 10498883). The tumor suppressive functions of p14ARF involve stabilization and activation of p53, via a mechanism of MDM2 inhibition (Sherr et al., 2005; 16869746, Ozenne et al., 2010; 20549699).

CDKN2B alterations such as seen here are predicted to inactivate p15INK4b (Jafri et al., 2015; 25873077). Concurrent putative homozygous deletion of CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been reported in 35% of patients with gliomas (cBio_Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661) and detected more frequently in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; 58%)(cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142) than in those with lower grade gliomas (13%) (cBioPortal, Sep 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). In other studies, loss of CDKN2A/B by deletion has been reported in up to 78% of astrocytomas (including anaplastic astrocytomas and GBM) (Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Weber et al., 2007; 16909113). A study found homozygous deletion of both p16INK4a and p14ARF in 26% (13/50) of glioblastomas (GBMs); 18% (9/50) of cases showed homozygous deletion of the p14ARF_encoding locus alone (Nakamura et al., 2001; 11303791). One study detected CDKN2A/B loss in 69% (161/232) and mutation in 2.6% (6/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Decreased p14ARF and p16INK4a expression levels were found to be tightly associated in a study of glioma samples (Chakravarti et al., 2001; 11489817). Homozygous deletion of the genomic region including CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been found to be associated with poor prognosis in GBM and likely serves as an early event in GBM progression (Feng et al., 2012; 21713760, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337). In addition, expression of p16INK4a has been found to be lower in patients with high grade malignant gliomas compared to patients with low grade gliomas, and loss of p16INK4a expression has been associated with shorter overall survival in pilocytic astrocytomas (Raabe et al., 2011; 21636552, Liu et al., 2011; 21843312). Preclinical data suggest that tumors with loss of p16INK4a function may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, ribociclib, and palbociclib (Konecny et al., 2011; 21278246, Katsumi et al., 2011; 21871868, Cen et al., 2012; 22711607, Logan et al., 2013; 23898052). Although case studies have reported that patients with breast cancer or uterine leiomyosarcoma harboring CDKN2A loss responded to palbociclib treatment (Elvin et al., 2017; 28283584, Gao et al., 2015; 26715889), multiple other clinical studies have shown no significant correlation between p16INK4a loss or inactivation and therapeutic benefit of these agents (Gopalan et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8077, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Konecny et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5557)(DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Johnson et al., 2014; 24797823); it is not known whether CDK4/6 inhibitors would be beneficial in this case. Although preclinical studies have suggested that loss of p14ARF function may be associated with reduced sensitivity to MDM2 inhibitors (Van Maerken et al., 2011; 21460101, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357), the clinical relevance of p14ARF as a predictive biomarker is not clear. There are no drugs that directly target the mutation or loss of CDKN2B in cancer. Because the p15INK4b protein encoded by CDKN2B is known to inhibit CDK4, tumors with CDKN2B mutation or loss may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as ribociclib, abemaciclib, and palbociclib (Infante et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 2528, Shapiro et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 2500)(Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126). Germline CDKN2A mutation is associated with melanoma_pancreatic cancer syndrome, a condition marked by increased risk of developing malignant melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer (Whelan et al., 1995; 7666917). Mutation carriers within families may develop either or both types of cancer, and melanoma cases may be referred to as familial or hereditary melanoma (Hansson, 2010; 20687502, Hogg et al., 1998; 9479083). CDKN2A is the most implicated gene in familial melanoma, with germline mutations present in 16% to 20% of familial melanoma cases (De Unamuno et al., 2018; 29543703, Soura et al., 2016; 26892650, Huerta et al., 2018; 29405243). CDKN2A alteration has also been implicated in familial melanoma_astrocytoma syndrome, an extremely rare tumor association characterized by dual predisposition to melanoma and nervous system tumors (Kaufman et al., 1993; 8414022, Bahuau et al., 1998; 9622062, Chan et al., 2017; 28699883). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of CDKN2A is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}, {"Name": "CDKN2A loss", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "CDKN2A loss"}}, "Interpretation": "CDKN2A encodes two different, unrelated tumor suppressor proteins, p16INK4a and p14ARF, whereas CDKN2B encodes the tumor suppressor p15INK4b (Quelle et al., 1995; 8521522, Sharpless, 2005; 15878778). Both p15INK4b and p16INK4a bind to and inhibit CDK4 and CDK6, thereby maintaining the growth_suppressive activity of the Rb tumor suppressor; loss or inactivation of either p15INK4b or p16INK4a contributes to dysregulation of the CDK4/6_cyclin_Rb pathway and loss of cell cycle control (Gazzeri et al., 1998; 9484839, Roussel, 1999; 10498883). The tumor suppressive functions of p14ARF involve stabilization and activation of p53, via a mechanism of MDM2 inhibition (Sherr et al., 2005; 16869746, Ozenne et al., 2010; 20549699). One or more alterations observed here are predicted to result in p16INK4a loss of function (Ruas et al., 1999; 10498896, Jones et al., 2007; 17909018, Haferkamp et al., 2008; 18843795, Huot et al., 2002; 12417717, Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Gombart et al., 1997; 9324288, Yang et al., 1995; 7780957, Parry and Peters, 1996; 8668202, Greenblatt et al., 2003; 12606942, Yarbrough et al., 1999; 10491434, Poi et al., 2001; 11255261, Byeon et al., 1998; 9660926, Kannengiesser et al., 2009; 19260062, Lal et al., 2000; 10719365, Koh et al., 1995; 7777061, McKenzie et al., 2010; 20340136, Miller et al., 2011; 21462282, Arap et al., 1997; 905385, Scaini et al., 2014; 24659262, Jenkins et al., 2013; 23190892, Walker et al., 1999; 10389768, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). One or more alterations seen here are predicted to result in p14ARF loss of function (Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Itahana and Zhang, 2008; 18538737, Zhang and Xiong, 1999; 10360174, Zhang et al., 1998; 9529249, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). CDKN2B alterations such as seen here are predicted to inactivate p15INK4b (Jafri et al., 2015; 25873077). Concurrent putative homozygous deletion of CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been reported in 35% of patients with gliomas (cBio_Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661) and detected more frequently in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; 58%)(cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142) than in those with lower grade gliomas (13%) (cBioPortal, Sep 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). In other studies, loss of CDKN2A/B by deletion has been reported in up to 78% of astrocytomas (including anaplastic astrocytomas and GBM) (Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Weber et al., 2007; 16909113).

Decreased expression of MTAP leads to MTA accumulation within tumor cells and their microenvironment (Kirovski et al., 2011; 21356366, Limm et al., 2013; 23265702, Stevens et al., 2009; 19097084), thereby reducing intracellular arginine methylation (Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473, Mavrakis et al., 2016; 26912361, Kryukov et al., 2016; 26912360) and altering cell signaling (Limm et al., 2014; 25087184, Stevens et al., 2009; 19097084). MTAP is located at 9p21, adjacent to CDKN2A and CDKN2B, with which it is frequently co_deleted in various cancers. Other alterations in MTAP are rare and have not been extensively characterized. MTAP loss/homozygous deletion as well as loss of expression has been reported in a wide variety of solid tumors and hematologic cancers (Wei et al., 2016; 27929028, Zhao and Zhao, 2016; 27556634); such events have been correlated with poor prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (Kirovski et al., 2011; 21356366), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (Huang et al., 2009; 19887491), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)(Marce et al., 2006; 16778103), melanoma (Meyer et al., 2010; 20500769, Wild et al., 2006; 16618867), gastric cancer (Kim et al., 2011; 21412930), myxofibrosarcoma (Li et al., 2014; 25426549), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (He et al., 2015; 26656376), ovarian carcinoma (Wei et al., 2016; 27929028) and non_small cell lung cancer (Su et al., 2014; 24969958). MTAP loss was not prognostic in pediatric B_cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (Mirebeau et al., 2006; 16818274) or in astrocytoma (Becker et al., 2015; 26088413). However, MTAP has also been reported to be overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (Snezhkina et al., 2016; 27433286), and MTAP retention is thought to be important for prostate cancer growth due to continuous supply of SAM (Bistulfi et al., 2016; 26910893). Germline SNPs in MTAP have been correlated with the development of cutaneous melanoma (Antonopoulou et al., 2015; 25407435, Mccioni et al., 2013; 23816148), esophageal cancer (Hyland et al., 2016; 26635288, Lin et al., 2017; 27960044), osteosarcoma (Zhi et al., 2016; 27994653), and CRC (Gu et al., 2013; 23361049). Preclinical and limited clinical evidence indicate that MTAP inactivation produces specific metabolic vulnerabilities. MTAP inactivation may confer sensitivity to MAT2A inhibitors (Heist et al., 2019; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract B116, Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473). A Phase 1 trial of MAT2A inhibitor AG_270 reported 1 PR and 2 SDs lasting longer than 6 months for patients with advanced solid tumors displaying MTAP loss (Heist et al., 2019; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract B116). Although preclinical data have suggested that MTAP loss sensitizes cells to PRMT5 inhibition (Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473, Mavrakis et al., 2016; 26912361, Kryukov et al., 2016; 2691236), MTAP loss may not be a biomarker of response to previously developed small_molecule SAM_uncompetitive PRMT5 inhibitors (Guccione and Richard, 2019; 31350521); dual PRMT1 and PRMT5 inhibition may be more effective (Fedoriw et al., 2019; 31257072, Srour et al., 2019; 31287990, Gao et al., 2019; 30916320). In preclinical cancer models, MTAP inactivation showed increased sensitivity to inhibitors of purine synthesis or purine analogs, especially upon addition of exogenous MTA, which is converted to adenine in normal cells, thereby providing competition to purine poisons lacking in MTAP_deficient cells (Hansen et al., 2019; 31040154, Tang et al., 2018; 29844120, Munshi et al., 2014; 24928612, de Oliveira et al., 2016; 26751376, Lubin and Lubin, 2009; 19478948, Tang et al., 2012; 22825330, Collins et al., 2012; 22252602, Bertino et al., 2011; 21301207, Coulthard et al., 2011; 21282358, Miyazaki et al., 2007; 17912432, Efferth et al., 2002; 11987241). A Phase 2 study of L_alanosine, an inhibitor of adenine synthesis, as a monotherapy for 65 patients with MTAP_deficient cancers reported no responses and stable disease in 23.6% (13/55) of patients (Kindler et al., 2009; 18618081).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). Low_level MSI has been reported in 5_9% of glioblastoma (GBM) samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927, Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285, Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). A large_scale study did not find high_level microsatellite instability (MSI_H) in any of 129 GBM samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), although a small_scale study reported MSI_H in 4 of 15 pediatric GBMs and 1 of 12 adult GBMs (Szybka et al., 2003; 12908754). The frequency of MSI has been reported to be increased in relapsed compared to primary GBM (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), in GBMs with a previous lower grade astrocytoma (Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285), and in giant cell GBM compared to classic GBM (Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "PIK3C2B", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "PI3K signaling is implicated in the regulation of metabolic control, immunity, angiogenesis and cardiovascular homeostasis, and is one of the most frequently dysregulated pathways in cancer.

Although PIK3C2B mutation has not been reported for many tumor types, microarray analysis of glioblastoma cell lines revealed that increased gene expression of PIK3C2B significantly correlated with insensitivity to erlotinib (Low et al., 2008; 19189657).

Mutations within the promoter region of TERT that confer enhanced TERT promoter activity have been reported in two hotspots, located at _124 bp and _146 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (also termed C228T and C250T, respectively)(Horn et al., 2013; 23348503, Huang et al., 2014; 23348506, Vinagre et al., 2013; 23887589), as well as tandem mutations at positions \u2013124/\u2013125 bp and \u2013138/\u2013139 bp (Horn et al., 2013; 23348503).

TERT promoter mutation has been shown to be significantly associated with increased TERT gene expression in astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and GBM (Arita et al., 2013; 23764841). TERT promoter mutations significantly associate with poor prognosis in patients with GBM, although this correlation may be due to the association with primary GBM as opposed to IDH_positive secondary GBM (Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Reitman et al., 2013; 24217890, Arita et al., 2013; 23764841). In the context of IDH_wildtype glioma, TERT mutations are associated with reduced OS (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021). Therapeutic options for targeting tumors with TERT mutations are limited, although a variety of approaches have been investigated, including immunotherapies using TERT as a tumor_associated antigen and antisense oligonucleotide_ or peptide_based therapies. TERT peptide vaccines showed limited anticancer efficacy in clinical trials (Zanetti et al., 2017; 27245281); however, in one preclinical study, the combination of a TERT peptide vaccine and anti_CTLA_4 therapy suppressed tumor growth (Duperret at al., 2018; 29249395). A Phase 2 study of the TERT inhibitor imetelstat for patients with advanced non_small cell lung cancer reported no improvement in PFS or OS (Chiappori et al., 2015; 25467017). TERT mutations are associated with 1p/19q co_deletion in oligodendrogliomas, and are highly recurrent in IDH/ATRX_wildtype glioblastoma (GBM) (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021)(Weller et al., 2020; 33293629). The presence of EGFR gene amplification or TERT promoter mutations are indicative of diffuse astrocytic glioma with molecular features of glioblastoma, WHO grade 4 in IDH1/2_wildtype tumors (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021) (Louis et al., 2021; 34185076).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "01", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "01"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Touat et al., 2020; 32322066, Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556, Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642). Glioblastoma (GBM) harbors a median TMB of 2.7 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 4.2% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). For pediatric patients, high TMB has been reported in a subset of high_grade gliomas, frequently in association with mutations in mismatch repair or proofreading genes and in TP53, whereas BRAF alterations or other oncogene fusions were observed more frequently in brain tumors harboring low TMB (Patel et al., 2020; 32386112, Johnson et al., 2017; 28912153). Increased TMB has been reported to correlate with higher tumor grade in glioma (Draaisma et al., 2015; 26699864) and glioblastoma (GBM) tissue samples with biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD) (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570), as well as with shorter OS of patients with diffuse glioma (Wang et al., 2020; 32164609). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In glioma, a lack of association between TMB and clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors has been reported (Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Touat et al., 2020; 32322066). However, multiple case studies have reported that patients with ultramutated gliomas driven by POLE mutations have benefited from treatment with anti_PD_1 (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556) or anti_PD_L1 (Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642) therapies. Therefore, although increased TMB alone may not be a strong biomarker for PD_1 or PD_L1 inhibitors in this cancer type, these agents may have efficacy for patients with glioma harboring both high TMB and POLE mutation.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "BARD1", "Alteration": "A25fs*41", "Title": "Study of Olaparib (MK_7339) in Combination With Pembrolizumab (MK_3475) in the Treatment of Homologous Recombination Repair Mutation (HRRm) and/or Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD)_Positive Advanced Cancer (MK_7339_007/KEYLYNK_007)", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "PARP, PD_1", "Locations": "Fukuoka (Japan), Seongnam_si (Korea, Republic of), Seoul (Korea, Republic of), Okayama (Japan), Nagoya (Japan), Tokyo (Japan), Kashiwa (Japan), Sapporo (Japan), Nedlands (Australia), Southport (Australia)", "NCTID": "NCT04123366", "Note": "Tumors with BARD1 inactivating mutation or loss may be sensitive to PARP inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "BARD1", "Alteration": "A25fs*41", "Title": "Efficacy and Safety of Olaparib (MK_7339) in Participants With Previously Treated, Homologous Recombination Repair Mutation (HRRm) or Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD) Positive Advanced Cancer (MK_7339_002 / LYNK_002)", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "PARP", "Locations": "Seongnam_si (Korea, Republic of), Seoul (Korea, Republic of), Nedlands (Australia), Port Macquarie (Australia), Darlinghurst (Australia), Adana (Turkey), Ankara (Turkey), Jerusalem (Israel), Konya (Turkey), Ramat Gan (Israel)", "NCTID": "NCT03742895", "Note": "Tumors with BARD1 inactivating mutation or loss may be sensitive to PARP inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "BARD1", "Alteration": "A25fs*41", "Title": "Ascending Doses of AZD6738 in Combination With Chemotherapy and/or Novel Anti Cancer Agents", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1/2", "Target": "ATR, PARP, PD_L1", "Locations": "Seongnam_si (Korea, Republic of), Seoul (Korea, Republic of), Goyang_si (Korea, Republic of), Cambridge (United Kingdom), Withington (United Kingdom), Manchester (United Kingdom), Coventry (United Kingdom), Sutton (United Kingdom), Oxford (United Kingdom), Villejuif (France)", "NCTID": "NCT02264678", "Note": "Tumors with BARD1 inactivating mutation or loss may be sensitive to PARP inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "BARD1", "Alteration": "A25fs*41", "Title": "Niraparib Combined With Radiotherapy in rGBM", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "PARP", "Locations": "Tianjin (China)", "NCTID": "NCT04715620", "Note": "Tumors with BARD1 inactivating mutation or loss may be sensitive to PARP inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "BARD1", "Alteration": "A25fs*41", "Title": "Selinexor & Talazoparib in Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors;
