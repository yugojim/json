These kinases function downstream of RAS as part of the MAPK (RAF_MEK_ERK) signaling cascade that facilitates cell proliferation, survival and transformation (Holderfield et al., 2014; 24957944, Burotto et al., 2014; 24948110). BRAF mutations have been reported in up to 20% of all cancers, with the majority of mutations occurring at the V600 position (Davies et al., 2002; 12068308, Kandoth et al., 2013; 24132290). Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. Various studies have implicated BRAF alterations, including V600E and rearrangements, in the oncogenesis of pediatric low grade astrocytomas, including gangliogliomas (Rodriguez et al., 2013; 23121055, Gronych et al., 2011; 21403401, Koelsche et al., 2013; 23822828, Nicolaides et al., 2011; 22038996, Huillard et al., 2012; 22586120, Dahiya et al., 2012; 22548077, Korshunov et al., 2009; 19543740, Schindler et al., 2011; 21274720, Donson et al., 2014; 24238153, Dougherty et al., 2010; 20156809). BRAF alterations have been reported in 1_3% of gliomas including low grade gliomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751, Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Basto et al., 2005; 15791479, Chi et al., 2012; 22821383, Knobbe et al., 2004; 15517309, Schindler et al., 2011; 21274720) and glioblastomas (GBM)(cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). Studies have reported conflicting results as to whether BRAF mutations, including V600E, are more likely to be found in lower grade astrocytomas or higher grade glioblastomas (Basto et al., 2005; 15791479, Schindler et al., 2011; 21274720, Horbinski et al., 2012; 22492957), and the frequency of the BRAF V600E mutation in astrocytoma reported in the literature varies by cohort (Bannykh et al., 2014; 25066317, Theeler et al., 2014; 24470550, Chapp\u00e9 et al., 2013; 23442159). BRAF V600E is not strongly associated with prognosis in patients with astrocytoma (Bannykh et al., 2014; 25066317, Chapp\u00e9 et al., 2013; 23442159). While one study associated KIAA1549_BRAF fusion with improved prognosis in pediatric patients with low grade astrocytomas (Hawkins et al., 2011; 21610142), others reported no significant association between BRAF rearrangements and outcome (Colin et al., 2013; 23278243, Jones et al., 2008; 18974108, Lin et al., 2012; 22157620, Horbinski et al., 2010; 20044755). BRAF and MEK inhibitors have shown efficacy for patients with activating BRAF alterations at the V600 codon; clinical outcomes are more limited for class 2 alterations in BRAF such as one or more of the alterations seen here. A retrospective study of immunotherapies in NSCLC reported a 69% DCR (9/13) for patients with class 2 mutations (Marin_Acevedo et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract e21016). MEK inhibitors alone or in combination with RAF inhibitors also may be of benefit in these alterations (Nikanjam et al., 2021; 33722853, Nebhan et al., 2021; 33861486, Gautschi et al., 2015; 26200454, Negrao et al., 2020; 32540409). Doublet RAF_ and MEK_directed therapy may be more efficacious relative to either monotherapy; a retrospective analysis of BRAF_mutated melanoma observed 5/16 patient responses to BRAF inhibitor with MEK inhibitor therapy in BRAF class 2 tumors and 0/13 responses to BRAF inhibitor monotherapy (Menzer et al., 2019; 31580757). A basket trial of single_agent BRAF_inhibitor vemurafenib (n=11) (Hainsworth et al., 2018; 29320312) and a trial in NSCLC (n=9) (Mazieres et al., 2020; 31959346) also did not yield any responses for patients with class 2 tumors. In a basket trial of single_agent MEK_inhibitor trametinib, no responses were observed for patients with class 2 tumors (3 SDs, n=5) (Johnson et al., 2020; 31924734). Investigational ERK inhibitors are also in development; a basket trial of ulixertinib reported 3 PRs for patients across class 2_mutated tumors (Sullivan et al., 2018; 29247021). A basket trial of second_generation investigational BRAF inhibitor PLX8394 reported 3 SDs and 4 PDs for patients with class 2 tumors (Janku et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT212). In 2 Phase 1 studies evaluating the MEK_pan_RAF dual inhibitor CH5126766, 3 patients harboring BRAF V600E mutations experienced PRs, including 2 patients with melanoma (Martinez_Garcia et al., 2012; 22761467) and 1 patient with low_grade serous ovarian carcinoma (Guo et al., 2020; 33128873).

Histones form part of the nucleosome complex around which DNA is coiled in the cell. H3F3A mutations affecting different hotspot residues, such as G35 (commonly referred to as G34 in the literature) and K28 (commonly known as K27), form different subgroups based on methylation and gene expression differences, the region of the brain affected, and clinical parameters (Sturm et al., 2012; 23079654). Recurrent mutations in the histone tail of H3F3A, at sites involved in critical post_translational modifications, have been reported at high frequency in pediatric and young adult brain tumors, including diffuse midline gliomas (Solomon et al., 2016; 26517431), diffuse hemispheric glioma (Fontebasso et al., 2013; 23417712), glioblastomas (Pandit et al., 2016; ISPNO Abstract HG_58)(Schwartzentruber et al., 2012; 22286061, Venneti et al., 2014; 25200322), aggressive pediatric gliomas (Wu et al., 2012; 22286216), pilocytic astrocytomas (Hochart et al., 2015; 25909089), gangliogliomas (Joyon et al., 2016; 27219822), glial and glioneuronal tumors (Nguyen et al., 2015; 25389051), as well as in low_grade gliomas undergoing transformation and secondary high_grade gliomas (Mistry et al., 2015; 25667294). These mutations were commonly found concurrently with mutations in TP53 or in ATRX and DAXX, which form a complex required for H3.3 recruitment to DNA, and were mutually exclusive with IDH1 mutations, which indirectly affect methylation of critical H3.3 residues (Schwartzentruber et al., 2012; 22286061). H3F3A K28M (also known as K27M) is a poor prognostic marker in glioma (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021). H3F3A G35 mutations are associated with disease onset during adolescence, whereas K28 mutations affect younger children and predict poorer IOS (Sturm et al., 2012; 23079654, Venneti et al., 2014; 25200322). H3F3A K28M mutation has also been identified in 58% of adult midline gliomas, and is associated with shorter OS for patients with brainstem gliomas but not for patients with thalamic gliomas (Feng et al., 2015; 26297251). Mutations of H3F3A or H3F3B, the other gene encoding histone H3.3, have also been detected in giant cell tumor of bone and chondroblastoma, with low mutation frequencies in other tumors of cartilage and bone (Behjati et al., 2013; 24162739, Kervarrec et al., 2017; 28059095, Righi et al., 2017; 28899740). H3F3B K37M (commonly known as K36M) has been identified in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, specifically in tumors of the oral cavity (Papillon_Cavanagh et al., 2017; 28067913). Overexpression of H3F3A is associated with poor survival in lung adenocarcinomas, and is thought to promote cancer cell invasion (Park et al., 2016; 27694942). Prospective data from pooled clinical studies and preclinical evidence suggest that H3F3A K28M mutation predicts benefit from the investigational selective dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) antagonist ONC201 (Chi et al., 2018; SNO abstract ACTR_34, Gardner et al., 2018; SNO abstract PDCT_06, Arrillaga_Romany et al., 2017; 29108308, Prabhu et al., 2018; 30559168), which is supported by increased expression of the ONC201 target DRD2 in H3F3A K28M_mutant versus wild_type gliomas (Chi et al, 2017; SNO abstract EXTH_42, Prabhu et al., 2018; 30559168). Among adult patients with recurrent H3F3A K28M_mutant gliomas, ONC201 achieved a DCR of 64% (7/11) and a 6_month PFS rate of 36% (5/14), with 3 patients experiencing complete and durable regressions of thalamic lesions (Chi et al., 2018; SNO abstract ACTR_34). Data from pooled ONC201 monotherapy trials showed that 31% (9/29) of patients with recurrent H3F3A K28M_mutated glioma remain progression free at 6.5 months median follow_up (Arrillaga et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 3005). Although other H3F3A mutations have been reported (Johnson et al., 2017; 28912153), it is unclear whether these therapeutic strategies would be relevant in gliomas with H3F3A mutations other than K28M. H3F3A K27M mutation is characteristic of diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27M_altered (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021)(Louis et al., 2021; 34185076, Pfister et al., 2022; 34921008).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "On the basis of clinical and preclinical data, H3F3A K28M mutation may predict response to antagonists of dopamine receptors D2.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": {"nctId": "NCT03295396", "Include": "true"}}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "KRAS", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "G12V", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "G12V"}}, "Interpretation": "KRAS encodes a member of the RAS family of small GTPases. Activating mutations in RAS genes can cause uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor formation (Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Kahn et al., 1987; 3310850). KRAS alterations affecting amino acids G12, G13, Q22, P34, A59, Q61, and A146, as well as mutations G10_A11insG, G10_A11insAG (also reported as G10_A11dup and G12_G13insAG), A18D, L19F, D33E, G60_A66dup/E62_A66dup, E62K, E63K, R68S, and K117N have been characterized as activating and oncogenic (Akagi et al., 2007; 17150185, Bollag et al., 1996; 8955068, Buhrman et al., 2010; 20194776, Colicelli, 2004; 15367757, Edkins et al., 2006; 16969076, Feig and Cooper, 1988; 3043178, Gremer et al., 2011; 20949621, Janakiraman et al., 2010; 20570890, Kim et al., 2016; 27147599, Lukman et al., 2010; 20838576, Naguib et al., 2011; 21371307, Prior et al., 2012; 22589270, Priv\u00e9 et al., 1992; 1565661, Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Scheffzek et al., 1997; 9219684, Scholl et al., 2009; 19490892, Smith et al., 2010; 20147967, Tyner et al., 2009; 19075190, Valencia et al., 1991; 2029511, White et al., 2016; 26854029, Wiest et al., 1994; 8058307, Kim et al., 2016; 27147599, Angeles et al., 2019; 31289513, Tong et al., 2014; 24642870, Loree et al., 2021; 34117033). In the TCGA dataset, KRAS mutations or amplification was detected in 1.8% of glioblastomas (GBM)(cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142) and 2.8% of lower grade gliomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751). In other studies KRAS mutations were observed in 2 out of 125 pilocytic astrocytomas, 1 out 25 grade 1 and 2 astrocytomas (Cin et al., 2011; 21424530, Janzarik et al., 2007; 17712732), and 2 out of 94 patients with GBM (Knobbe et al., 2004; 15517309). While the importance of RAS signaling in astrocytomas has been established, there is very little information regarding clinical implications of KRAS alterations in human astrocytoma (Mellinghoff et al., 2011; 22015553, Cin et al., 2011; 21424530). In mouse models of cancer, activating KRAS mutation in combination with AKT mutation was sufficient to induce GBM in astrocytes and neural progenitors (Holland et al., 2000; 10802656). Furthermore, mutant KRAS_driven signaling was required for the maintenance of mouse GBM tumors (Holmen and Williams, 2005; 16166301), suggesting that targeting KRAS signaling may be an appropriate therapeutic strategy in KRAS_driven GBMs. Preclinical evidence suggests that KRAS activation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, such as trametinib, binimetinib, cobimetinib, and selumetinib (Nakano et al., 1984; 6320174, Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Yamaguchi et al., 2011; 21523318, Watanabe et al., 2013; 23438367, Gilmartin et al., 2011; 21245089, Yeh et al., 2009; 19372556). In a Phase 1 study evaluating the MEK_pan_RAF dual inhibitor CH5126766, 6 patients harboring KRAS mutations experienced PRs, including 3 with non_small cell lung cancer (NCSLC), 1 with low_grade serous ovarian carcinoma (LGSOC), 1 with endometrial adenocarcinoma, and 1 with multiple myeloma (Guo et al., 2020; 33128873). Combination of CH5126766 with the FAK inhibitor defactinib elicited PR rates of 50% (4/8) for patients with KRAS_mutated low_grade serous ovarian cancer and 12% (2/17) for patients with KRAS_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a Phase 1 study (Krebs et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT019, Shinde et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT143). Preclinical and clinical data suggest that KRAS mutations may predict clinical benefit from SHP2 inhibitors (Lu et al., 2019; 31068384, Mainardi et al., 2018; 29808006, Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001, Brana et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3005, Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). A Phase 1 study of RMC_4630 for relapsed/refractory solid tumors reported a DCR of 58% (23/40) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS mutations and a DCR of 75% (12/16) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS G12C mutations (Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001). Interim results from a Phase 1/2 study of RMC_4630 plus cobimetinib reported tumor reduction in 3 of 8 patients with KRAS_mutated colorectal cancer (Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). Preclinical data suggest that KRAS mutation may confer sensitivity to SOS1 inhibitors (Hillig et al., 2019; 30683722, Hofmann et al., 2021; 32816843, Gerlach et al., 2020; AACR Abstract 1091). Phase 1 studies of the SOS1 inhibitor BI 1701963 alone or in combination with MEK inhibitors, KRAS G12C inhibitors, or irinotecan are recruiting for patients with solid tumors harboring KRAS mutations (Hofmann et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT210, Gort et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract TPS3651). While clinical responses have been reported for patients with KRAS_mutated ovarian (Monk et al., 2020; 32822286, Farley et al., 2013; 23261356, Pejovic et al., 2015; Am J Clin Exp Obstet Gynecol 2:140_143, Slosberg et al., 2018; 29765547, Han et al., 2018; 29946554), cervical small cell neuroendocrine (Lyons et al., 2014; 26075998), or uterine cancer (Slosberg et al., 2018; 29765547) treated with MEK inhibitor monotherapy, multiple clinical trials have not demonstrated increased response rates for patients with KRAS_altered tumors including KRAS_mutated CRC (Tsimberidou et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract e22086, Infante et al., 2012; 22805291, Zimmer et al., 2014; 24947927, Bennouna et al., 2011; 20127139, Weekes et al., 2013; 23434733), pancreatic cancer (Van Laethem et al., 2017; 27975152, Infante et al., 2014; 24915778, Van Cutsem et al., 2018; 29756206), and NSCLC (Blumenschein et al., 2015; 25722381, Leijen et al., 2012; 22767668, Zimmer et al., 2014; 24947927). A Phase 2 study of trametinib and uprosertib for patients with recurrent cervical cancer reported no responses for patients with KRAS_mutated (2/2 SDs) or KRAS_amplified (1/1 SD) cancer (Lui et al., 2019; 31118140).

ATRX inactivation or loss of expression is associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)(Lovejoy et al., 2012; 22829774, Bower et al, 2012; 23185534; Heaphy et al., 2011; 21719641, Liau et al., 2015; 25229770). Alterations that disrupt the ADD domain (aa 167_270) or helicase domain (aa 2010_2280) of ATRX are predicted to result in loss of ATRX function (Nan et al., 2007; 17296936, Garrick et al., 2004; 14729260, Eustermann et al., 2011; 21666677); however, the loss of ATRX function is not sufficient to induce ALT, which requires other undetermined factors (Clynes et al., 2013; 23916100, Flynn et al., 2015; 25593184). Germline mutations in ATRX give rise to alpha_thalassemia X_linked intellectual disability syndrome (ATR_X syndrome)(Gibbons et al., 1995; 7697714). Somatic mutation of ATRX has been reported in a number of solid tumor types, often associated with ALT (Heaphy et al., 2011; 21719641). ATRX mutation correlating with ALT has been reported in 10_20% of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs)(Singhi et al., 2015; USCAP Abstract 1797)(Jiao et al., 2011; 21252315, Heaphy et al., 2011; 21719641), 12.6% of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (Fishbein et al., 2015; 25608029), and 48% of adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with glioblastoma (GBM) or neuroblastoma (Morosini et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 11008)(Cheung et al., 2012; 22416102, Molenaar et al., 2012; 22367537, Pugh et al., 2013; 23334666, Cheung and Dyer, 2013; 23702928). ATRX loss in PNET (Singhi et al., 2015; USCAP Abstract 1797)(Marinoni et al., 2014; 24148618) and melanoma (Qadeer et al., 2014; 24468746) and mutation in other neuroendocrine tumors (Fishbein et al., 2015; 25608029) is associated with poor prognosis. Pediatric patients with high_grade glioma and ATRX mutation were shown to have more aggressive disease but are more responsive to treatment with double_strand break therapy (Koschmann et al., 2016; 26936505). ATRX mutation or loss of expression is more frequent in Grade 2/3 astrocytoma and secondary GBM than primary GBM, oligodendroglioma, and oligoastrocytoma (Kannan et al., 2012; 23104868, Haberler and W\u00f6hrer, 2014; 24559763, Reuss et al., 2014; 25427834, Sahm et al., 2014; 25143301) and has been proposed as a distinguishing biomarker (Haberler and W\u00f6hrer, 2014; 24559763, Reuss et al., 2014; 25427834, Sahm et al., 2014; 25143301). ATRX mutation has not been detected in concurrence with MYCN amplification in glioma and neuroblastoma (Cheung et al., 2012; 22416102, Molenaar et al., 2012; 22367537, Pugh et al., 2013; 23334666, Cheung and Dyer, 2013; 23702928). Low_grade gliomas with both IDH1/2 mutation and ATRX mutation are associated with worse prognosis than those with IDH1/2 mutation but no ATRX mutation (Haberler and W\u00f6hrer, 2014; 24559763). Loss of ATRX protein expression has been reported in 33_39% of incidences of leiomyosarcoma (LMS) associating with ALT, a poor prognostic factor across all LMS subtypes, and with poor prognosis in extrauterine LMS but not in uterine LMS (Singhi et al., 2015; USCAP Abstract 93)(Liau et al., 2015; 25229770). No targeted therapies are available to directly address ATRX inactivation. Based on preclinical (Liang et al., 2020; 31551363, Garbarino et al., 2021; 34118569) and limited clinical data (Cole et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT059), ATRX alterations may confer sensitivity to combination strategies involving WEE1 inhibition. In a Phase 2 study evaluating the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib plus irinotecan for the treatment of pediatric patients with neuroblastoma, prolonged SD was reported for 44% (4/9) of patients with ATRX_deficient tumors and responses were seen in two tumors that had evidence of ALT (Cole et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT059). Preclinical evidence also suggests that ATRX deficiency may impart sensitivity to synthetic lethal approaches involving PARP inhibition and irinotecan (George et al., 2020; 32846370), combined PARP and ATR inhibition (Garbarino et al., 2021; 34118569), or double_strand break_induction with agents such as doxorubicin, irinotecan, and topotecan (Koschmann et al., 2016; 26936505); however, these approaches have not been demonstrated clinically.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "FANCC", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "W113*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "W113*"}}, "Interpretation": "FANCC encodes a key component of an eight protein (FANCA/B/C/E/F/G/L/M) Fanconi anemia (FA) nuclear E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is involved in DNA repair and is essential for prevention of chromosome breakage caused by DNA damage (Moldovan and D\u2019Andrea, 2009; 19686080). Upon DNA damage or during the S_phase of the cell cycle, the FA complex is activated and recruited to the sites of DNA damage/DNA repair. The complex then activates FANCD2 and FANCL via monoubiquitination, leading to their co_localization with FANCD1/BRCA2, BRCA1, RAD51, PCNA, and other proteins at the DNA repair foci on chromatin. Germline mutations in FANCC cause Fanconi anemia, a clinically heterogeneous disorder involving various developmental abnormalities as well as predisposition to cancer; underlying these phenotypes are defects in DNA repair (Deakyne and Mazin, 2011; 21568838). Somatic mutations in FANCC are very infrequently observed in human malignancies (COSMIC, Jan 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). There are no targeted therapies that directly address loss of FANCC activity. However, limited preclinical evidence (Ghosh et al., 2014; 24200853, Lombardi et al., 2015; 25609062) and clinical evidence in sarcoma (Piha_Paul et al., 2018; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract A096) suggest that FANCC alterations may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Cannot Be Determined", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Cannot Be Determined"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI_High has been reported in 3_8% of adult or pediatric astrocytomas and was generally not associated with Lynch syndrome (Alonso et al., 2001; 11280776, Rodr\u00edguez_Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2013; 24073290, Vladimirova et al., 2008; 18053027). Low_level MSI has been reported in 5_9% of glioblastoma (GBM) samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927, Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285, Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). A large_scale study did not find high_level microsatellite instability (MSI_H) in any of 129 GBM samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), although a small_scale study reported MSI_H in 4 of 15 pediatric GBMs and 1 of 12 adult GBMs (Szybka et al., 2003; 12908754). The frequency of MSI has been reported to be increased in relapsed compared to primary GBM (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), in GBMs with a previous lower grade astrocytoma (Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285), and in giant cell GBM compared to classic GBM (Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). On the basis of prospective clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD_1_targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143) and PD_L1_targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92).

TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Touat et al., 2020; 32322066, Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556, Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642). Astrocytomas harbor a median TMB of 1.8 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 1.4% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). For pediatric patients, high TMB has been reported in a subset of high_grade gliomas, frequently in association with mutations in mismatch repair or proofreading genes and in TP53, whereas BRAF alterations or other oncogene fusions were observed more frequently in brain tumors harboring low TMB (Patel et al., 2020; 32386112, Johnson et al., 2017; 28912153). Increased TMB has been reported to correlate with higher tumor grade in glioma (Draaisma et al., 2015; 26699864) and glioblastoma (GBM) tissue samples with biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD) (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570), as well as with shorter OS of patients with diffuse glioma (Wang et al., 2020; 32164609). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In glioma, a lack of association between TMB and clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors has been reported (Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Touat et al., 2020; 32322066). However, multiple case studies have reported that patients with ultramutated gliomas driven by POLE mutations have benefited from treatment with anti_PD_1 (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556) or anti_PD_L1 (Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642) therapies.
