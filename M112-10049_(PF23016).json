APC interacts with beta_catenin and controls signaling in the WNT pathway, which regulates embryonic development and cell differentiation (Logan and Nusse, 2004; 15473860). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt APC function or expression (Eklof et al., 2001; 11707392, Liu et al., 2006; 16753179, Dikovskaya et al., 2010; 20144988, Murphy et al., 2007; 17410430, Aretz et al., 2004; 15459959). APC mutations have been found in 73% of tumors in the colorectal adenocarcinoma TCGA dataset (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696). In 1 study, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of APC was observed in 32% of colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (Christie et al., 2013; 23085758). The prognostic significance of APC mutations in sporadic CRC remains unclear (Quyn et al., 2008; 19110823). Solid tumors with WNT/beta_catenin pathway alterations, as seen here, were observed to have significantly less T_cell inflammation in one study (Luke et al., 2019; 30635339). There are no approved drugs targeting APC inactivation in cancer. Loss of APC function leads to accumulation of beta_catenin and upregulation of WNT pathway transcription programs (Zhan et al., 2017; 27617575), and potential therapeutic approaches to target this pathway include CBP/beta_catenin antagonists, which interfere with the ability of beta_catenin to interact with transcriptional co_activator CBP (Jung et al., 2020; 32037398, Krishnamurthy and Kurzrock, 2018; 29169144). In a Phase 1 trial of the CBP/beta_catenin antagonist E7386, 1 patient with APC_mutated small bowel adenocarcinoma achieved a PR with tumor shrinkage of _69% and response duration of 165 days (Kawazoe et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 473P); preclinical data support sensitivity of APC_deficient gastric or colorectal cancer models to E7386 (Yamada et al., 2021; 33408116, Kanda et al., 2022; 34837838). One or more of the APC variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (ClinVar, Sep 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in APC are found in more than 90% of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) (Kerr et al., 2013; 23159591, Fearon, 2011; 21090969, Kastritis et al., 2009; 18844223). The prevalence for FAP in the general population is estimated to be 1:8,300 from birth (Half et al., 2009; 19822006), and in the appropriate clinical context germline testing of APC is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Based on preclinical and limited clinical data, APC inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to CBP/beta_catenin interaction inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT05091346", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04008797", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03264664", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "BRAF", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "V600E", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "40.43", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "V600E"}}, "Interpretation": "BRAF encodes a member of the RAF family of protein kinases, which includes ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF. These kinases function downstream of RAS as part of the MAPK (RAF_MEK_ERK) signaling cascade that facilitates cell proliferation, survival and transformation (Holderfield et al., 2014; 24957944, Burotto et al., 2014; 24948110). BRAF mutations have been reported in up to 20% of all cancers, with the majority of mutations occurring at the V600 position (Davies et al., 2002; 12068308, Kandoth et al., 2013; 24132290). Among the V600 mutations, V600E accounts for 70_80% of observations, V600K for 10_30%, and V600R for 5_7%, with V600D comprising the majority of the rest (Davies et al., 2002; 12068308, Greaves et al., 2013; 23273605, Klein et al., 2013; 23237741). Mutations at V600 are Class 1 BRAF alterations that have been shown to constitutively activate BRAF kinase and hyperactivate the downstream MEK_ERK signaling, promoting oncogenic transformation (Wellbrock et al., 2004; 15059882, Davies et al., 2002; 12068308). In multiple cancer types, multiple mutations at V600, including V600E, V600K, V600R, V600D, and V600M, exhibited sensitivity to V600_targeted therapies (Hauschild et al., 2012; 22735384, McArthur et al., 2014; 24508103, Fisher et al., 2012; 22904646, Yang et al., 2010; 20551065, Gentilcore et al., 2013; 23317446, Klein et al., 2013; 23237741, van den Brom et al., 2013; 23473613, Klein et al., 2013; 23490649, Ponti et al., 2013; 23463675, Ponti et al., 2012; 23031422, Parakh et al., 2015; 25382067, Lee et al., 2017; 28194436); other mutations at this position are predicted to behave similarly. BRAF mutations have been reported in approximately 5_19% of colorectal cancer samples (De Roock et al., 2011; 21163703, Di Nicolantonio et al., 2008; 19001320, Dienstmann et al., 2012; 22723336, Safaee et al., 2012; 23056577, Guedes et al., 2013; 23548132). BRAF V600E is a strong adverse prognostic marker in colorectal cancer (NCCN Colon Cancer Guidelines, v3.2022, NCCN Rectal Cancer Guidelines, v4.2022, Cervantes et al., 2023; 36307056). BRAF mutations have been associated with poor prognosis and shorter survival for patients with colorectal cancer, particularly those with metastatic disease, as well as with smoking history (Sinicrope et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract 3514, Hassabo et al., 2014; ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium Abstract 473) (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Bokemeyer et al., 2012; 22446022, Gavin et al., 2012; 23045248, Laurent_Puig et al., 2009; 19884556, Ogino et al., 2012; 22147942, Roth et al., 2010; 20008640, Douillard et al., 2013; 24024839, Hsu et al., 2016; 26989027). Analysis of individual BRAF mutations in 2127 patients with advanced colorectal cancer treated with chemotherapy with or without cetuximab revealed that BRAF V600E associated with poor prognosis (HR 2.60, P=1.0e_15, with median reduction of survival being 320 days) and distinct clinicopathological features, including correlation with increased peritoneal metastases compared to BRAF wild_type tumors (24% vs. 12%, P=0.0015), while BRAF D594G inactivating mutation was not prognostic (HR 1.30, P=0.37) and had similar clinicopathologic features as BRAF wild_type tumors (Summers et al., 2016; 27815357). Significant benefit for patients with BRAF V600_mutated colorectal cancers (CRC) has been achieved with combinatorial approaches involving BRAF inhibitors, EGFR_targeting antibodies, and MEK inhibitors (Kopetz et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 4001, Corcoran et al., 2018; 29431699, Hyman et al., 2015; 26287849, Yaeger et al., 2015; 25589621, Kopetz et al., 2020; 33356422). In a Phase 3 study for patients with metastatic CRC on second_ or third_line treatments, doublet therapy with the RAF inhibitor encorafenib and the EGFR antibody cetuximab showed superior mOS to cetuximab plus chemotherapy (9.3 vs. 5.9 months, HR=0.61, n=220 and n=221), and similar benefit was seen for a triplet therapy cohort adding the MEK inhibitor binimetinib (OS of 9.3 months, n=224) (Kopetz et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 4001). Combinations of other RAF inhibitors such as dabrafenib or vemurafenib with EGFR antibodies such as panitumumab have also resulted in clinical benefit for similar patient populations in Phase 1 and 2 studies. A trial of dabrafenib and panitumumab with or without the MEK inhibitor trametinib reported a 21% ORR and 86% DCR (n=91) for the triplet combination and a 10% ORR and 90% DCR (n=20) for the doublet therapy (Corcoran et al., 2018; 29431699). Multiple similar studies of vemurafenib with panitumumab or cetuximab doublet therapy have also reported a benefit (Hyman et al., 2015; 26287849, Yaeger et al., 2015; 25589621). In a randomized Phase 2 study for patients with 0_4 previous lines of therapy, the addition of vemurafenib to cetuximab and irinotecan significantly improved ORR (17% vs. 4.2%, n=50 and n=50) and DCR (65% vs. 21%) (Kopetz et al., 2020; 33356422). A Phase 2 trial evaluating the investigational agent spartalizumab, an anti_PD_1 antibody, with dabrafenib and trametinib reported an ORR of 35% (n=20) and DCR of 75% (Corcoran et al., 2020; ESMO GI Abstract SO_26). Extensive clinical evidence supports a significant benefit in BRAF_inhibitor and MEK_inhibitor doublet therapy for patients with BRAF V600E_mutated metastatic CRC. A Phase 2 study of vemurafenib plus cobimetinib for patients with advanced BRAF V600E_mutated CRC reported an ORR of 29% (n=28) and DCR of 57% (Klute et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 122), and a similar trial of dabrafenib and trametinib reported a 12% ORR (n=43) and 67% DCR (Corcoran et al., 2015; 26392102). A basket trial of the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib for patients with BRAF V600_mutated solid cancers elicited 1 PR and 1 SD for 3 patients with CRC (Ascierto et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 9518). In 2 Phase 1 studies evaluating the MEK_pan_RAF dual inhibitor CH5126766, 3 patients harboring BRAF V600E mutations experienced PRs, including 2 patients with melanoma (Martinez_Garcia et al., 2012; 22761467) and 1 patient with low_grade serous ovarian carcinoma (Guo et al., 2020; 33128873). Based on clinical data in solid tumors, patients with tumors harboring BRAF V600 mutations may benefit from treatment with type_II RAF inhibitors such as tovorafenib, lifirafenib, and belvarafenib (Olszanski et al., 2017; DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdx367.043, Desai et al., 2020; 32182156, Janku et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 2586, Yen et al., 2021; 33953400). On the basis of extensive clinical data, BRAF V600 mutation does not generally associate with significant clinical benefit from addition of cetuximab or panitumumab to chemotherapy (NCCN Colon Cancer Guidelines, v1.2022) (Pietrantonio et al., 2015; 25673558, Rowland et al., 2015; 25989278, Van Custem et al., 2011; 21502544, Smith et al., 2013; 23741067, Douillard et al., 2013; 24024839, Karapetis et al., 2014; 24218517, Peeters et al., 2013; 23325582, Peeters et al., 2015; 26341920, Guren et al., 2017; 28399112, Seymour et al., 2013; 23725851). Low response rates to cetuximab or panitumumab monotherapy or combination with chemotherapy have been frequently observed among patients with BRAF V600_mutated CRC, although similarly low response rates in this patient population were also often observed to chemotherapy alone; additionally, response rates were generally lower for patients with BRAF_mutated tumors than for those whose tumors were BRAF_wildtype (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Peeters et al., 2013; 23325582, Seymour et al., 2013; 23725851, Karapetis et al., 2014; 24218517, Di Nicolantonio et al., 2008; 19001320, Stintzing et al., 2017; 28463756, Tol et al., 2009; 19571295). For a limited number of patients with CRC treated with cetuximab_ or panitumumab_containing chemotherapy regimens, BRAF V600E was found to be present at the time of progression (Freeman et al., 2008; 18621636, Gao et al., 2011; 23357879, Soeda et al., 2013; 22638623, Molinari et al., 2011; 21632860, Andre et al., 2013; 23041588, Benvenuti et al., 2007; 17363584), to be a mechanism of acquired (Arena et al., 2015; 25623215, Montagut et al., 2012; 22270724) or primary (Todelo et al., 2017; 27852040) resistance, or to be enriched in tumors of non_responders versus responders (Molinari et al., 2011; 21632860).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "BRAF activating alterations may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of BRAF, MEK, or ERK.

Vemurafenib can induce adverse effects, such as the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas, keratoacanthomas, and new primary melanomas caused by inactivation of wildtype BRAF and leading to paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway (Gibney et al., 2013; 23712190, McArthur et al., 2014; 24508103). In a Phase 1b trial, patients with BRAF V600E_mutated melanoma treated with a combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib had increased RR (87%) and PFS (13.7 months) compared to the RR and PFS values previously reported for vemurafenib or MEK inhibitor monotherapy; this combination also resulted in lower rates of cutaneous SCC (Ribas et al., 2014; 25037139). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Cetuximab", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets EGFR.

A study comparing PIK3CA exon 9 and 20 mutations reported that for patients with chemotherapy_refractory CRC, PIK3CA exon 20 mutations were associated with less benefit from cetuximab compared with PIK3CA wildtype (ORR of 0.0% [0/9] vs. 37% [121/329], PFS of 11.5 vs. 24 weeks, and OS of 34 vs. 51 weeks); this effect was not observed with PIK3CA exon 9 mutations (ORR of 29% [6/21] vs. 36% [115/317], PFS of 23.5 vs. 24 weeks, and OS of 46 vs. 51 weeks) (De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739). The presence of PIK3CA exon 9 and 20 mutations showed no correlation with objective tumor response to cetuximab but was associated with reduced PFS in response to cetuximab salvage therapy (HR=2.1) (Souglakos et al., 2009; 19603024). In contrast, multiple studies and case reports of cetuximab treatment of CRC have reported similar responses in patients with PIK3CA exon 9 or 20 mutations compared with PIK3CA wildtype (Cappuzzo et al., 2008; 18577988, Tol et al., 2010; 20413299, Prenan et al., 2009; 19366826, Bray et al., 2019; 31653970, Lambrechts et al., 2009; ASCO Abstract 4020, Karapetis et al., 2013; 24218517, Moiseyenko et al., 2018; 29470838, Fu et al., 2021; 33842311). Patients with BRAF V600_mutated CRC are considered unlikely to benefit from cetuximab, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, unless combined with BRAF inhibitors (NCCN Colon Cancer Guidelines, v1.2022). Response rates to cetuximab, both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy, have generally been found to be low for patients with BRAF V600_mutated CRC, independent of treatment line and chemotherapy backbone (Van Custem et al., 2011; 21502544, Stintzing et al., 2017; 28463756, Karapetis et al., 2014; 24218517, Park et al, 2011; 21340604, Loupakis et al., 2009; 19603018, Di Nicolantonio et al., 2008; 19001320, De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739, Hsu et al., 2016; 26989027, Lupini et al., 2015; 26508446, Inno et al., 2011; 21729677, Tol et al., 2009; 19571295, Gao et al., 2011; 23357879, Benvenuti et al., 2007; 17363584, Lupini et al., 2015; 26508446, Modest et al., 2012; 21960311).

PIK3CA alterations that have been characterized as activating, such as observed here, are predicted to be oncogenic (Kang et al., 2005; 15647370, Ikenoue et al., 2005; 15930273, Gymnopoulos et al., 2007; 17376864, Horn et al., 2008; 18317450, Rudd et al., 2011; 21266528, Hon et al., 2012; 22120714, Burke et al., 2012; 22949682, Wu et al., 2009; 19915146, Dbouk et al., 2010; 2103068, Dan et al., 2010; 20530683, Oda et al., 2008; 18829572, Zhao and Vogt, 2008; 18794883, Lui et al., 2013; 23619167, Ross et al., 2013; 22430209, Riviere et al., 2012; 22729224, Shibata et al., 2009; 19394761, Droguluk et al., 2015; 26627007, Croessmann et al., 2018; 29284706, Ng et al., 2018; 29533785, Spangle et al., 2020; 32929011, Chen et al., 2018; 29636477, Jin et al., 2021; 34779417). PIK3CA mutations have been reported in up to 19% of colorectal cancers (CRCs)(Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, cBio_Brannon et al., 2014; 25164765). A meta_analysis of 864 patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) treated with cetuximab_ or panitumumab_based therapy showed that PIK3CA mutations, particularly in exon 20 (H1047R), are significantly associated with worse response (Huang et al., 2014; 24701207) and shorter PFS and OS (De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739). A study of 354 patients with metastatic CRC observed no difference in OS between patients with PIK3CA mutations versus those without (21.7 months vs. 22.4 months, respectively); however, the study did not include treatment information for the patients (Fong et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 57). Clinical and preclinical data in various tumor types indicate that PIK3CA activating alterations may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting PI3K (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574, Juric et al., 2018; 29401002, Gallant et al., 2019; 30793038, Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23, Delestre et al., 2021; 34613809, Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Santin et al., 2020; 31934607, Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871), AKT (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Smyth et al., 2021; 33863913), or mTOR (Varnier et al., 2019; 31351267, Basse et al., 2018; 32914004, Sultova et al., 2021; 33277683, Mackay et al., 2014; 24166148, Myers et al., 2016; 27016228, Dhami et al., 2018; 29588307, Harris et al., 2019; 30863722, Hanna et al., 2018; 29301825). The Phase 2 NCI_MATCH study of copanlisib for patients with refractory solid tumors harboring PIK3CA mutations with or without PTEN loss met its primary endpoint with an ORR of 16% (4/25 PRs); responses (PR or SD >6 months) were seen in patients with ameloblastoma, liposarcoma, and carcinomas of the endometrium, ovary, esophagus, lung, and prostate (Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871). However, the Phase 2 study of copanlisib for patients with endometrial carcinoma harboring PIK3CA hotspot mutations failed to report any objective responses (n=11)(Santin et al., 2020; 31934607). Two other studies of copanlisib for patients with genomically unselected tumors reported 1 CR and 2 PRs (1 unconfirmed) among 16 total patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors with or without PTEN alterations (Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108). Emerging evidence suggests that the glutaminase inhibitor telaglenastat has clinical activity in PIK3CA_mutated colorectal cancer (CRC). A Phase 1 trial of telaglenastat and capecitabine for patients with CRC who progressed on fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy observed numerically increased median PFS for patients with PIK3CA mutation compared with patients with wildtype PIK3CA status (24.8 vs. 16 weeks, n=7 vs. n=4), including SD >30 weeks for 3 patients with PIK3CA mutation (Zhao et al., 2020; 32907836). Multiple clinical studies report that inhibitors of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway have not produced significant clinical benefit as monotherapies to treat CRC, even for tumors that harbor alterations in PIK3CA or PTEN; data are more limited for alterations in other genes in this pathway (Ng et al., 2013; 23743569, Ganesan et al., 2013; 24092809, Janku et al., 2014; 24440717). Based on clinical data, it is unclear whether the presence of PIK3CA mutations is associated with reduced sensitivity to cetuximab in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Detection of PIK3CA mutations at progression was observed for patients with CRC following treatment with cetuximab (Xu et al., 2017; 28424201, Kim et al., 2021; 34315006, Soeda et al., 2013; 22638623). A study comparing PIK3CA exon 9 and 20 mutations reported that for patients with chemotherapy_refractory CRC, PIK3CA exon 20 mutations were associated with less benefit from cetuximab compared with PIK3CA wildtype; this effect was not observed with PIK3CA exon 9 mutations (De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739).

Activating mutations in RAS genes can cause uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor formation (Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Kahn et al., 1987; 3310850). No alterations in KRAS were identified in this case. Approximately 50_65% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) have been reported to lack KRAS mutations (Lievre et al., 2006; 16618717, De Roock et al., 2011; 21163703, Chen et al., 2014; 25367198, Li et al., 2015; 25929517, Hu et al., 2016; 27977612, Zekri et al., 2017; 28218784, Staudacher et al., 2017; 29048416, Wang et al., 2018; 29705968, Guo et al., 2018; 29666387). Numerous studies have reported that KRAS wild_type status is associated with decreased metastasis, better clinicopathological features, and longer survival of patients with CRC (Chen et al., 2014; 25367198, Li et al., 2015; 25929517, Hu et al., 2016; 27977612, M\u00e1rmol et al., 2017; 28106826, Zekri et al., 2017; 28218784, Kwak et al., 2017; 28858102). Lack of mutations in KRAS or NRAS is associated with clinical benefit of treatment with EGFR_targeting antibodies cetuximab (Van Cutsem et al., 2011; 21502544, Bokemeyer et al., 2011; 21228335, Karapetis et al., 2008; 18946061, De Roock et al., 2008; 17998284) or panitumumab (Douillard et al., 2014; 24718886, Douillard et al., 2012; 24024839, Amado et al., 2008; 18316791) for patients with CRC. Therefore, these agents are indicated to treat patients with CRC lacking such mutations (NCCN Guidelines v1.2022). Based on clinical data, it is unclear whether the presence of PIK3CA mutations is associated with reduced sensitivity to cetuximab in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Detection of PIK3CA mutations at progression was observed for patients with CRC following treatment with cetuximab (Xu et al., 2017; 28424201, Kim et al., 2021; 34315006, Soeda et al., 2013; 22638623). A study comparing PIK3CA exon 9 and 20 mutations reported that for patients with chemotherapy_refractory CRC, PIK3CA exon 20 mutations were associated with less benefit from cetuximab compared with PIK3CA wildtype; this effect was not observed with PIK3CA exon 9 mutations (De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739).

The presence of PIK3CA exon 9 and 20 mutations showed no correlation with objective tumor response to cetuximab but was associated with reduced PFS in response to cetuximab salvage therapy (HR=2.1) (Souglakos et al., 2009; 19603024). In contrast, multiple studies and case reports of cetuximab treatment of CRC have reported similar responses in patients with PIK3CA exon 9 or 20 mutations compared with PIK3CA wildtype (Cappuzzo et al., 2008; 18577988, Tol et al., 2010; 20413299, Prenan et al., 2009; 19366826, Bray et al., 2019; 31653970, Lambrechts et al., 2009; ASCO Abstract 4020, Karapetis et al., 2013; 24218517, Moiseyenko et al., 2018; 29470838, Fu et al., 2021; 33842311). Patients with BRAF V600_mutated CRC are considered unlikely to benefit from cetuximab, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, unless combined with BRAF inhibitors (NCCN Colon Cancer Guidelines, v1.2022). Response rates to cetuximab, both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy, have generally been found to be low for patients with BRAF V600_mutated CRC, independent of treatment line and chemotherapy backbone (Van Custem et al., 2011; 21502544, Stintzing et al., 2017; 28463756, Karapetis et al., 2014; 24218517, Park et al, 2011; 21340604, Loupakis et al., 2009; 19603018, Di Nicolantonio et al., 2008; 19001320, De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739, Hsu et al., 2016; 26989027, Lupini et al., 2015; 26508446, Inno et al., 2011; 21729677, Tol et al., 2009; 19571295, Gao et al., 2011; 23357879, Benvenuti et al., 2007; 17363584, Lupini et al., 2015; 26508446, Modest et al., 2012; 21960311).

The Phase 3 study STRATEGIC_1 reported a similar duration of disease control (DDC) for patients with unresectable metastatic CRC (mCRC) and KRAS_, NRAS_, and BRAF_wildtype status treated with mFOLFOX_bevacizumab alternated with a cetuximab regimen in first or second line, respectively (overall DDC 22.5 vs. 23.5 months); in addition, the study reported similar OS (37.8 vs. 34.4 months) and higher numerical ORR for patients treated with cetuximab in the first line followed by mFOLFOX_bevacizumab compared with those receiving EGFR_directed antibodies in the second or third line (Chibaudel et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 3504). A prospective study of cetuximab monotherapy for patients with KRAS_, NRAS_, and BRAF_wildtype mCRC reported 11% (2/19) PRs and 58% (11/19) SDs (Moiseyenko et al., 2018; 29470838).

However, significant clinical responses have been reported for patients with BRAF V600E_mutated CRC upon treatment with panitumumab in combination with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor trametinib (Bendell et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 3515). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> Panitumumab has been shown to improve OS, PFS, and ORR for patients with KRAS_wildtype colorectal cancer (CRC), both in combination with FOLFOX4, FOLFIRI, irinotecan, or best supportive care (Douillard et al., 2014; 24718886, Peeters et al., 2015; 26341920, Watanabe et al., 2022; 35723084, Kim et al., 2018; 29703606, Shitara et al., 2016; 27712015), and as monotherapy for chemotherapy_refractory patients (Price et al., 2014; 24739896, Van Cutsem et al., 2007; 17470858, Peeters et al., 2013; 23325582). The Phase 3 PARADIGM trial comparing panitumumab plus mFOLFOX6 versus bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6 as first_line treatment for patients with RAS_wildtype left_sided metastatic CRC demonstrated that treatment with panitumumab significantly improved median OS (mOS; 36.2 months vs. 31.3 months) compared with bevacizumab (Yoshino et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract LBA1).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS colorectal cancers (CRCs) make up 70_85% of CRC cases (Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894). MSS colorectal cancers are molecularly heterogeneous, driven by diverse mechanisms such as extensive DNA methylation, oncogenic mutations in KRAS or BRAF, or chromosomal instability (Jass, 2007; 17204026). Multiple studies have shown that MSS CRCs have a worse prognosis than MSI_high tumors (Samowitz et al., 2001; 11535541, Elsaleh and Iacopetta, 2001; 12445368, Brueckl et al., 2003; 12820457, Guidoboni et al., 2001; 11438476, Gryfe et al., 2000; 10631274, Sinicrope et al., 2006; 16952542, Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Laghi and Malesci, 2012; 22722556). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60). For patients with chemotherapy_refractory microsatellite_stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), a Phase 3 trial reported no OS advantage from the combination of the PD_L1 inhibitor atezolizumab plus cobimetinib relative to regorafenib (8.9 vs. 8.5 months, HR=1.00); atezolizumab monotherapy similarly did not prolong OS (7.1 vs. 8.5 months, HR=1.19) (Ciardiello et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract LBA_004). For patients with MSS CRC, a Phase 2 study combining ipilimumab and nivolumab reported an overall DCR of 25% (10/40) (Parikh et al., 2021; DOI: 10.1038/s43018_021_00269_7). Two Phase 1 studies for patients with MSS CRC treated with regorafenib and nivolumab reported PFSs of 7.9 months (Fukuoka et al., 2020; 32343640) and 5.7 months (Kim et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1016/j.annonc.2020.04.073), and a patient with MSS CRC refractory to chemotherapy treated with the PD_1 inhibitor sintilimab and regorafenib reported a CR (Zhang et al., 2021; 34688262).

Patients with MSS CRC are more likely to benefit from postsurgical fluorouracil (FU)_based adjuvant therapy (Ribic et al., 2003; 12867608, Sargent et al., 2010; 20498393) but less likely to benefit from irinotecan chemotherapy (Fallik et al., 2003; 14522894).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "NRAS", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "wildtype", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "wildtype"}}, "Interpretation": "NRAS encodes a member of the RAS family of small GTPases that mediate transduction of growth signals.

A study comparing PIK3CA exon 9 and 20 mutations reported that for patients with chemotherapy_refractory CRC, PIK3CA exon 20 mutations were associated with less benefit from cetuximab compared with PIK3CA wildtype (ORR of 0.0% [0/9] vs. 37% [121/329], PFS of 11.5 vs. 24 weeks, and OS of 34 vs. 51 weeks); this effect was not observed with PIK3CA exon 9 mutations (ORR of 29% [6/21] vs. 36% [115/317], PFS of 23.5 vs. 24 weeks, and OS of 46 vs. 51 weeks) (De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739). The presence of PIK3CA exon 9 and 20 mutations showed no correlation with objective tumor response to cetuximab but was associated with reduced PFS in response to cetuximab salvage therapy (HR=2.1) (Souglakos et al., 2009; 19603024). In contrast, multiple studies and case reports of cetuximab treatment of CRC have reported similar responses in patients with PIK3CA exon 9 or 20 mutations compared with PIK3CA wildtype (Cappuzzo et al., 2008; 18577988, Tol et al., 2010; 20413299, Prenan et al., 2009; 19366826, Bray et al., 2019; 31653970, Lambrechts et al., 2009; ASCO Abstract 4020, Karapetis et al., 2013; 24218517, Moiseyenko et al., 2018; 29470838, Fu et al., 2021; 33842311). Patients with BRAF V600_mutated CRC are considered unlikely to benefit from cetuximab, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, unless combined with BRAF inhibitors (NCCN Colon Cancer Guidelines, v1.2022). Response rates to cetuximab, both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy, have generally been found to be low for patients with BRAF V600_mutated CRC, independent of treatment line and chemotherapy backbone (Van Custem et al., 2011; 21502544, Stintzing et al., 2017; 28463756, Karapetis et al., 2014; 24218517, Park et al, 2011; 21340604, Loupakis et al., 2009; 19603018, Di Nicolantonio et al., 2008; 19001320, De Roock et al., 2010; 20619739, Hsu et al., 2016; 26989027, Lupini et al., 2015; 26508446, Inno et al., 2011; 21729677, Tol et al., 2009; 19571295, Gao et al., 2011; 23357879, Benvenuti et al., 2007; 17363584, Lupini et al., 2015; 26508446, Modest et al., 2012; 21960311).

The Phase 3 study STRATEGIC_1 reported a similar duration of disease control (DDC) for patients with unresectable metastatic CRC (mCRC) and KRAS_, NRAS_, and BRAF_wildtype status treated with mFOLFOX_bevacizumab alternated with a cetuximab regimen in first or second line, respectively (overall DDC 22.5 vs. 23.5 months); in addition, the study reported similar OS (37.8 vs. 34.4 months) and higher numerical ORR for patients treated with cetuximab in the first line followed by mFOLFOX_bevacizumab compared with those receiving EGFR_directed antibodies in the second or third line (Chibaudel et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 3504). A prospective study of cetuximab monotherapy for patients with KRAS_, NRAS_, and BRAF_wildtype mCRC reported 11% (2/19) PRs and 58% (11/19) SDs (Moiseyenko et al., 2018; 29470838).

RB1 mutations have been reported in <1% of colorectal adenocarcinoma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, cBio_Yaeger et al., 2018; 29316426). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of RB1 alterations in colorectal carcinoma are limited (PubMed, Sep 2022). On the basis of limited clinical data (Owonikoko et al., 2016; ESMO Abstract 14230) and strong preclinical data (Hook et al., 2012; 22222631, Gong et al., 2019; 30373917, Oser et al., 2019; 30373918, Yang et al., 2022; 34741392), RB1 inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to inhibitors of Aurora kinase A, particularly in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). A clinical study evaluating the Aurora kinase A inhibitor alisertib for patients with prostate cancer did not find an association between RB1 deletion and clinical benefit (Beltran et al., 2019; 30232224). Other approaches to target RB1 inactivation under investigation in preclinical studies include inhibitors of BCL_2 family members (Allaman_Pillet et al., 2013; 21955141) and activation of the NOTCH pathway (Viatour et al., 2011; 21875955).

Germline mutations in RB1 account for approximately 40% of RB tumors (Yun et al., 2011; 22553621) and are associated with an increased risk of developing secondary malignancies that include soft tissue and bone sarcoma and malignant melanoma (Houston et al., 2011; 21139478, Ng et al., 2010; 19959033).

SMAD4 alterations that result in loss or disruption of the MH1 domain (aa 18_142), MH2 domain (aa 323_552), or SAD domain (aa 275_320) are predicted to be inactivating (Massague et al., 2005; 16322555, Mor\u00e9n et al., 2000; 10980615, Xu and Attisano, 2000; 10781087, Luo et al., 1999; 10485843, Jones and Kern, 2000; 10871368, Fink et al., 2001; 11196171, De Bosscher et al., 2004; 14715079, Shi et al., 1997; 9214508, Miyaki et al., 1999; 10340381, Prokova et al., 2007; 17994767, Wu et al., 2001; 11274206, Ding et al., 2009; 19139564, Kuang et al., 2004; 14647410, Watanabe et al., 2000; 11265759, Bosscher et al., 2004; 14715079). SMAD4 mutation or homozygous deletion is most frequently observed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (43%)(cBio_Witkiewicz et al., 2015; 25855536), pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (26%)(Jiao et al., 2014; 24293293), cholangiocarcinoma (25%)(Churi et al., 2014; 25536104), small intestine cancer (20%) (Takeda et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 642), appendiceal adenocarcinoma (14_20% mutation; 57% deletion)(Liu et al., 2014; 24821835, Maru et al., 2004; 14647445), colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC; 14%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696), esophageal adenocarcinoma (14%)(Wang et al., 2015; 26336083), and stomach adenocarcinoma (13%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317). In preclinical studies, SMAD4 loss of function has been implicated in the development of mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas, including mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN)(Izeradjene et al., 2007; 17349581) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN)(Bardeesy et al., 2006; 17114584); in clinical samples, SMAD4 homozygous deletion has been observed in 10% of IPMNs and 8% of MCNs, and mutation was also observed in 5% of IPMNs (Springer et al., 2015; 26253305). SMAD4 gene alterations have been associated with reduced OS for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Blackford et al., 2009; 19584151). Reduced SMAD4 expression has been associated with worse prognosis in various cancer types, including CRC (Yan et al., 2016; 26861460, Kozak et al., 2015; 25681512, Roth et al., 2012; 23104212), appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (Davison et al., 2014; 24618609), gastric adenocarcinoma (Kim et al., 2004; 15033661, Xiangming et al., 2001; 11234879), esophageal adenocarcinoma (Singhi et al., 2015; 25634752), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Natsugoe et al., 2002; 12060625), breast cancer (de Kruijf et al., 2013; 23022998), and prostate cancer (Shipitsin et al., 2014; 25032733). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in SMAD4. Preclinical studies in colorectal cancer have reported associations of SMAD4 inactivation or loss with sensitivity to inhibitors of Aurora kinase A (Shi et al., 2022; 35393542) and the Wnt/beta_catenin pathway (Park et al., 2022; 35274815). Clinical studies have reported associations of SMAD4 loss or low SMAD4 expression with improved responses to chemotherapeutic agents in patients with pancreatic cancer (Ormanns et al., 2017; 28534865, Fei et al., 2021; 34002944, Bachet et al., 2012; 22377565) and non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Ziemke et al., 2017; 28577946). Other clinical studies in pancreatic cancer have reported an association of high SMAD4 expression with better responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Kassardjian and Wang, 2020; 32897998) and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (Pen et al., 2021; 33667587). One or more of the SMAD4 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with juvenile polyposis syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline SMAD4 mutations, including those at the R361 hotspot, have been observed in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome (Houlston et al., 1998; 9811934, Woodford_Richens et al., 2000; 10764709, Howe et al., 2004; 15235019, Howe et al., 2004; 15235019, Howe et al., 2004; 15235019), which is associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal cancers (Brosens et al., 2011; 22171123). The penetrance of deleterious SMAD4 mutations in patients with colon cancer is estimated at 20% by age 35 and 70% by age 65 (Kalia et al., 2017; 27854360).

TP53 mutations have been reported in up to 75% of colorectal cancer cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Goh et al., 1995; 7585578, Berg et al., 2010; 21103049, Han et al., 2013; 23700467, Peeters et al., 2013; 23325582, Malhotra et al., 2013; 23526092, Di Bartolomeo et al., 2013; 23821376, Fong et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 57). A study reported p53 expression in 49% of analyzed colorectal cancer cases (Wangefjord et al., 2013; 23337059). TP53 mutation has not been consistently demonstrated to be a significant independent prognostic marker in the context of CRC (Russo et al., 2005; 16172461, Fong et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 57). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "05", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "05"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Fabrizio et al., 2018; 30151257, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526). Elevated tumor mutational burden (TMB) has been reported in 8_25% of colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (George et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3587, Nagahashi et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e15103, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117, Shao et al., 2020; 33119110). Multiple studies have reported that up to 90% of hypermutated CRC cases exhibit high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI_H) and mismatch repair deficiency (MMR_D) (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). Increased TMB is significantly associated with MSI_H and MMR_D, with studies reporting that 100% of MSI_H CRCs harbor elevated TMB and conversely that 100% of tumors with low TMB harbor intact MMR (George et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3587, Nagahashi et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e15103, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). A subset of CRCs that harbor increased TMB but not MSI_H are driven by mutations in POLE, which leads to an \u201cultramutated\u201d phenotype with especially high TMB (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117). Tumors with increased TMB harbor BRAF V600E mutations more frequently than those with low TMB (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Stadler et al., 2016; 27022117), whereas TMB_low tumors more frequently harbor mutations in TP53 and APC (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696). The prognostic value of tumor mutational burden (TMB) in colorectal cancer (CRC) is context_ and therapy_dependent. A study of tissue TMB (tTMB) in 145 CRC samples showed longer OS in TMB_high samples compared with TMB_low ones (Schwartz et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 572). Similarly, for patients with metastatic CRC treated with first_line chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab or cetuximab, high tissue TMB (tTMB_H) was associated with longer OS (Innocenti et al., 2019; 30865548). For patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, tTMB_H was associated with better 5_year relapse_free survival (Lee et al., 2019; 31285374). However, for patients with EGFR/BRAF_inhibitor_treated, BRAF_mutated microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic CRC, intermediate tTMB was associated with significantly poorer PFS and OS compared with TMB_low status; patients with primary resistance to EGFR/BRAF blockage had higher TMB than those sensitive to these therapies (Randon et al., 2022; 34933155). In a study for 61 patients with metastatic, MSS CRC treated with best standard of care, plasma TMB scores \u226528 Muts/Mb (approximately 14 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) were associated with reduced OS compared with plasma TMB scores <28 Muts/Mb (3.0 vs. 5.3 months, HR=0.76, p=0.007), whereas tTMB was not found to be prognostic in this population (Chen et al., 2020; 32379280, Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, increased tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Ott et al., 2019; 30557521, Cristescu et al., 2022; 35101941, Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). In the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors, significant improvement in ORR was observed for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) compared with those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526); similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). At the same TMB cutpoint, retrospective analysis of patients with solid tumors treated with any checkpoint inhibitor identified that tissue TMB scores \u2265 10 Muts/Mb were associated with prolonged time to treatment failure compared with scores <10 muts/Mb (HR=0.68) (Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). For patients with solid tumors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the CheckMate 848 trial, improved responses were observed in patients with a tissue TMB \u2265 10 Muts/Mb independent of blood TMB at any cutpoint in matched samples (Schenker at al., 2022; AACR Abstract 7845). However, support for higher TMB thresholds and efficacy was observed in the prospective Phase 2 MyPathway trial of atezolizumab for patients with pan_solid tumors, where improved ORR and DCR was seen in patients with TMB \u2265 16 Muts/Mb than those with TMB \u2265 10 and <16 Muts/Mb (Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409). Similarly, analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386). In CRC specifically, a retrospective analysis of immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy reported significantly improved OS for patients with tumors harboring TMB \u22659.8 Muts/MB compared with those with tumors with TMB <9.8 Muts/Mb (~ equivalency <12 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254). Another retrospective study reported that a TMB \u226512 Muts/Mb cutoff identifies >99% of MSI_High CRC cases but only 3% of MSS cases, indicating the utility of this cutoff for identification of patients with CRC likely to benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Fabrizio et al., 2018; 30151257).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "APC", "Alteration": "T1556fs*3", "Title": "A Study of E7386 in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Previously Treated Participants With Selected Solid Tumors", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1/2", "Target": "CBP, Beta_catenin, PD_1", "Locations": "Fukuoka (Japan), Osaka (Japan), Shizouka (Japan), Tokyo (Japan), Chiba_shi (Japan), Kashiwa (Japan), Sapporo shi (Japan), Glasgow (United Kingdom), Manchester (United Kingdom), London (United Kingdom)", "NCTID": "NCT05091346", "Note": "Based on preclinical and limited clinical data, APC inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to CBP/beta_catenin interaction inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "APC", "Alteration": "T1556fs*3", "Title": "A Study of E7386 in Combination With Other Anticancer Drug in Participants With Solid Tumor", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "CBP, Beta_catenin, FGFRs, RET, PDGFRA, VEGFRs, KIT", "Locations": "Kurume (Japan), Matsuyama (Japan), Seodaemun (Korea, Republic of), Osakasayama (Japan), Nagoya (Japan), Kawasaki (Japan), Chuo_Ku (Japan), Koto_ku (Japan), Chiba (Japan), Kashiwa (Japan)", "NCTID": "NCT04008797", "Note": "Based on preclinical and limited clinical data, APC inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to CBP/beta_catenin interaction inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "APC", "Alteration": "T1556fs*3", "Title": "Study of E7386 in Participants With Selected Advanced Neoplasms", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "CBP, Beta_catenin", "Locations": "Glasgow (United Kingdom), Manchester (United Kingdom), London (United Kingdom), Sutton (United Kingdom)", "NCTID": "NCT03264664", "Note": "Based on preclinical and limited clinical data, APC inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to CBP/beta_catenin interaction inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "BRAF", "Alteration": "V600E", "Title": "BRAF V600E_mutant Colorectal Cancer Study of Encorafenib Taken With Cetuximab Plus or Minus Chemotherapy (BREAKWATER)", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 3", "Target": "VEGFA, MEK, BRAF, EGFR", "Locations": "Taipei (Taiwan), Taoyuan (Taiwan), Taichung (Taiwan), Fuzhou (China), Tainan (Taiwan), Kaohsiung (Taiwan), Hangzhou (China), Shanghai (China), Busan (Korea, Republic of), Nanjing (China)", "NCTID": "NCT04607421", "Note": "BRAF activating alterations may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of BRAF, MEK, or ERK.
