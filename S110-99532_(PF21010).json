KIT aberrations, including point mutations, translocations, amplification, and overexpression, have been associated with various malignancies, and KIT is considered an oncoprotein (Fletcher, 2004; 15175998). KIT alterations in exon 11 leading to disruption of the autoinhibitory domain (amino acids 545_579)(Allander et al., 2001; 11751374, Chan et al., 2003; 12697809, Hirota et al., 1998; 9438854, Martin et al., 2005; 16135486, Rubin et al., 2001; 11719439, Tarn et al., 2005; 15897563, Corless et al., 2004; 15507676, Chen et al., 2005; 15824741) or internal tandem duplication (ITD) proximal to the kinase domain (amino acids 569_591)(Kim et al., 2011; 21640708), such as observed here, are predicted to be activating and sensitive to imatinib (Corbacioqlu et al., 2006; 16840725, Gronchi, 2013; 23206668, Heinrich et al., 2003; 14645423). KIT exon 11 deletions are frequently observed in the context of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) (Antonescu et al., 2005; 15930355, Hirota et al., 1998; 9438854, Joensuu et al., 2013; 23623056) and KIT_ITDs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)(Beghini et al., 2004; 15339674, Corbacioqlu et al., 2006; 16840725, Jiao et al., 2009; 19458628, Manara et al., 2014; 24226631, Wang et al., 2005; 15650049). The V654A mutation is located within the kinase domain of KIT and promotes increased proliferation of cells in the presence of c_KIT ligand and is therefore also considered to be activating (Roberts et al., 2007; 17363509). It is also a common secondary KIT mutation, acquired in addition to an existing activating mutation in KIT; this mutation has been associated with resistance to imatinib (Garner et al., 2014; 25239608, Bertucci et al., 2006; 16786129, Heinrich et al., 2006; 16954519, Wardelmann et al., 2005; 15811621, Wardelmann et al., 2006; 16551858, Guo et al., 2009; 19861442, Heinrich et al., 2008; 18955458) and avapritinib (Evans et al., 2017; 29093181, Mazzocca et al., 2019; 31205499) in patients and cell_based models and was shown to lead to decreased sensitivity to regorafenib and ponatinib in 1 preclinical study (Garner et al., 2014; 25239608). Activating alterations in KIT, or the related gene PDGFRA, are known to underlie inherited predisposition to gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) development (Agarwal and Robson, 2009; 19248967, Miettinen and Lasota, 2006; 17090188). KIT mutation has been reported in 54_72% of GIST cases, and the majority of these mutations affect exon 9 or exon 11 (Mikami et al., 2013; 24119563, Wang et al., 2013; 23862765, Andersson et al., 2006; 16697720). It is estimated that up to 95% of GISTs overexpress the KIT protein, and KIT mutation has been reported to be an early event in the development of GIST (Corless et al., 2011; 22089421, Mikami et al., 2013; 24119563). Mutations in exon 11 of KIT are associated with a significantly greater response rate to imatinib, compared to individuals with mutations in exon 9 or without mutations in KIT (Joensuu et al., 2013; 23623056, Gronchi, 2013; 23206668). Studies comparing patients with GIST treated with imatinib to those treated with placebo indicate that the presence of exon 11 in_frame deletions is associated with a significantly longer recurrence_free survival in univariate analysis; similar results were not observed for patients with exon 11 insertions, exon 11 point mutations, exon 9 mutations, or no KIT mutation (Corless et al., 2014; 24638003). Overall, patients with exon 11 mutations experienced a benefit from adjuvant imatinib therapy, which is in agreement with several previous studies (Corless et al., 2014; 24638003, Joensuu et al., 2013; 23623056, Gronchi, 2013; 23206668, Joensuu et al., 2012; 22453568), but although the reported effect on overall survival is favorable, it does not always reach statistical significance (Corless et al., 2014; 24638003, Joensuu et al., 2012; 22453568). However, patients that develop imatinib resistance have a poorer prognosis than those without including a reduced 5 year survival rate (Peixoto et al., 2018; 29755776). On the basis of clinical evidence, primarily in GIST, AML, and systemic mastocytosis, KIT activating alterations are associated with sensitivity to KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitors including imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib, dasatinib, nilotinib, pazopanib, regorafenib, ponatinib, midostaurin, avapritinib, and ripretinib (Heinrich et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 10506, Heinrich et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 11011, DeAngelo et al., 2017; ASH Abstract 2, Evans et al., 2017; 29093181, Abbaspour Babaei et al., 2016; 27536065, Ramaswamy et al., 2016; 27563456, Demetri et al., 2013; 23177515, Gotlib et al., 2016; 27355533, Jawhar et al., 2017; 28424161, Xu et al., 2014; 25031773, Gotlib et al., 2005; 15972446, George et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 11511). The use of mTOR inhibitors as an alternative therapeutic strategy has demonstrated limited success in KIT_mutated, imatinib_resistant melanoma, with 1 PR and 3 SD observed for 4 patients treated with everolimus (Si et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract 8562, Si et al., 2012; 22162580). However, no responses were observed for 10 patients with mastocytosis following everolimus monotherapy, with 8/10 patients harboring the KIT D816V mutation (Parikh et al., 2010; 20038218). The role of KIT amplification as a biomarker for response to mTOR inhibitors has not been investigated (PubMed, Mar 2021). In a dose escalation study of GIST patients who developed KIT resistant mutations, most commonly in exons 11 and 17 after progressing on imatinib, treatment with the higher dosage of PLX9486 alone and in the lower dosage in combination with pexidartinib reported clinical benefit rates of 64% (7/11) and 67% (6/9), respectively (Wagner et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 11509). However, the KIT V654A mutation has been associated with resistance to imatinib in patients and cell_based models (Wada et al., 2016; 26779618, Heydt et al., 2015; 25886408, Garner et al., 2014; 25239608, Bertucci et al., 2006; 16786129, Heinrich et al., 2006; 16954519, Wardelmann et al., 2005; 15811621, Wardelmann et al., 2006; 16551858, Guo et al., 2009; 19861442, Heinrich et al., 2008; 18955458) and was shown to reduce sensitivity to regorafenib and ponatinib in preclinical studies; although this mutation still may be inhibited at clinically achievable doses (Schrock et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract B266, Garner et al., 2014; 25239608). Additional clinical and preclinical data suggest that KIT V654A may confer reduced sensitivity to avapritinib. (Evans et al., 2017; 29093181, Mazzocca et al., 2019; 31205499).

KIT aberrations, including point mutations, translocations, amplification, and overexpression, have been associated with various malignancies, and KIT is considered an oncoprotein (Fletcher, 2004; 15175998). KIT alterations in exon 11 leading to disruption of the autoinhibitory domain (amino acids 545_579)(Allander et al., 2001; 11751374, Chan et al., 2003; 12697809, Hirota et al., 1998; 9438854, Martin et al., 2005; 16135486, Rubin et al., 2001; 11719439, Tarn et al., 2005; 15897563, Corless et al., 2004; 15507676, Chen et al., 2005; 15824741) or internal tandem duplication (ITD) proximal to the kinase domain (amino acids 569_591)(Kim et al., 2011; 21640708), such as observed here, are predicted to be activating and sensitive to imatinib (Corbacioqlu et al., 2006; 16840725, Gronchi, 2013; 23206668, Heinrich et al., 2003; 14645423). KIT exon 11 deletions are frequently observed in the context of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) (Antonescu et al., 2005; 15930355, Hirota et al., 1998; 9438854, Joensuu et al., 2013; 23623056) and KIT_ITDs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)(Beghini et al., 2004; 15339674, Corbacioqlu et al., 2006; 16840725, Jiao et al., 2009; 19458628, Manara et al., 2014; 24226631, Wang et al., 2005; 15650049). The V654A mutation is located within the kinase domain of KIT and promotes increased proliferation of cells in the presence of c_KIT ligand and is therefore also considered to be activating (Roberts et al., 2007; 17363509). It is also a common secondary KIT mutation, acquired in addition to an existing activating mutation in KIT; this mutation has been associated with resistance to imatinib (Garner et al., 2014; 25239608, Bertucci et al., 2006; 16786129, Heinrich et al., 2006; 16954519, Wardelmann et al., 2005; 15811621, Wardelmann et al., 2006; 16551858, Guo et al., 2009; 19861442, Heinrich et al., 2008; 18955458) and avapritinib (Evans et al., 2017; 29093181, Mazzocca et al., 2019; 31205499) in patients and cell_based models and was shown to lead to decreased sensitivity to regorafenib and ponatinib in 1 preclinical study (Garner et al., 2014; 25239608). Activating alterations in KIT, or the related gene PDGFRA, are known to underlie inherited predisposition to gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) development (Agarwal and Robson, 2009; 19248967, Miettinen and Lasota, 2006; 17090188). KIT mutation has been reported in 54_72% of GIST cases, and the majority of these mutations affect exon 9 or exon 11 (Mikami et al., 2013; 24119563, Wang et al., 2013; 23862765, Andersson et al., 2006; 16697720). It is estimated that up to 95% of GISTs overexpress the KIT protein, and KIT mutation has been reported to be an early event in the development of GIST (Corless et al., 2011; 22089421, Mikami et al., 2013; 24119563). Mutations in exon 11 of KIT are associated with a significantly greater response rate to imatinib, compared to individuals with mutations in exon 9 or without mutations in KIT (Joensuu et al., 2013; 23623056, Gronchi, 2013; 23206668). Studies comparing patients with GIST treated with imatinib to those treated with placebo indicate that the presence of exon 11 in_frame deletions is associated with a significantly longer recurrence_free survival in univariate analysis; similar results were not observed for patients with exon 11 insertions, exon 11 point mutations, exon 9 mutations, or no KIT mutation (Corless et al., 2014; 24638003). Overall, patients with exon 11 mutations experienced a benefit from adjuvant imatinib therapy, which is in agreement with several previous studies (Corless et al., 2014; 24638003, Joensuu et al., 2013; 23623056, Gronchi, 2013; 23206668, Joensuu et al., 2012; 22453568), but although the reported effect on overall survival is favorable, it does not always reach statistical significance (Corless et al., 2014; 24638003, Joensuu et al., 2012; 22453568). However, patients that develop imatinib resistance have a poorer prognosis than those without including a reduced 5 year survival rate (Peixoto et al., 2018; 29755776). On the basis of clinical evidence, primarily in GIST, AML, and systemic mastocytosis, KIT activating alterations are associated with sensitivity to KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitors including imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib, dasatinib, nilotinib, pazopanib, regorafenib, ponatinib, midostaurin, avapritinib, and ripretinib (Heinrich et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 10506, Heinrich et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 11011, DeAngelo et al., 2017; ASH Abstract 2, Evans et al., 2017; 29093181, Abbaspour Babaei et al., 2016; 27536065, Ramaswamy et al., 2016; 27563456, Demetri et al., 2013; 23177515, Gotlib et al., 2016; 27355533, Jawhar et al., 2017; 28424161, Xu et al., 2014; 25031773, Gotlib et al., 2005; 15972446, George et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 11511). The use of mTOR inhibitors as an alternative therapeutic strategy has demonstrated limited success in KIT_mutated, imatinib_resistant melanoma, with 1 PR and 3 SD observed for 4 patients treated with everolimus (Si et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract 8562, Si et al., 2012; 22162580). However, no responses were observed for 10 patients with mastocytosis following everolimus monotherapy, with 8/10 patients harboring the KIT D816V mutation (Parikh et al., 2010; 20038218). The role of KIT amplification as a biomarker for response to mTOR inhibitors has not been investigated (PubMed, Mar 2021). In a dose escalation study of GIST patients who developed KIT resistant mutations, most commonly in exons 11 and 17 after progressing on imatinib, treatment with the higher dosage of PLX9486 alone and in the lower dosage in combination with pexidartinib reported clinical benefit rates of 64% (7/11) and 67% (6/9), respectively (Wagner et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 11509). However, the KIT V654A mutation has been associated with resistance to imatinib in patients and cell_based models (Wada et al., 2016; 26779618, Heydt et al., 2015; 25886408, Garner et al., 2014; 25239608, Bertucci et al., 2006; 16786129, Heinrich et al., 2006; 16954519, Wardelmann et al., 2005; 15811621, Wardelmann et al., 2006; 16551858, Guo et al., 2009; 19861442, Heinrich et al., 2008; 18955458) and was shown to reduce sensitivity to regorafenib and ponatinib in preclinical studies; although this mutation still may be inhibited at clinically achievable doses (Schrock et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract B266, Garner et al., 2014; 25239608). Additional clinical and preclinical data suggest that KIT V654A may confer reduced sensitivity to avapritinib. (Evans et al., 2017; 29093181, Mazzocca et al., 2019; 31205499).

ATRX inactivation or loss of expression is associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)(Lovejoy et al., 2012; 22829774, Bower et al, 2012; 23185534; Heaphy et al., 2011; 21719641, Liau et al., 2015; 25229770). Alterations that disrupt the ADD domain (aa 167_270) or helicase domain (aa 2010_2280) of ATRX are predicted to result in loss of ATRX function (Nan et al., 2007; 17296936, Garrick et al., 2004; 14729260, Eustermann et al., 2011; 21666677); however, the loss of ATRX function is not sufficient to induce ALT, which requires other undetermined factors (Clynes et al., 2013; 23916100, Flynn et al., 2015; 25593184). Germline mutations in ATRX give rise to alpha_thalassemia X_linked intellectual disability syndrome (ATR_X syndrome)(Gibbons et al., 1995; 7697714). Somatic mutation of ATRX has been reported in a number of solid tumor types, often associated with ALT (Heaphy et al., 2011; 21719641). ATRX mutation correlating with ALT has been reported in 10_20% of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs)(Singhi et al., 2015; USCAP Abstract 1797)(Jiao et al., 2011; 21252315, Heaphy et al., 2011; 21719641), 12.6% of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (Fishbein et al., 2015; 25608029), and 48% of adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with glioblastoma (GBM) or neuroblastoma (Morosini et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 11008)(Cheung et al., 2012; 22416102, Molenaar et al., 2012; 22367537, Pugh et al., 2013; 23334666, Cheung and Dyer, 2013; 23702928). ATRX loss in PNET (Singhi et al., 2015; USCAP Abstract 1797)(Marinoni et al., 2014; 24148618) and melanoma (Qadeer et al., 2014; 24468746) and mutation in other neuroendocrine tumors (Fishbein et al., 2015; 25608029) is associated with poor prognosis. Pediatric patients with high_grade glioma and ATRX mutation were shown to have more aggressive disease but are more responsive to treatment with double_strand break therapy (Koschmann et al., 2016; 26936505). ATRX mutation or loss of expression is more frequent in Grade 2/3 astrocytoma and secondary GBM than primary GBM, oligodendroglioma, and oligoastrocytoma (Kannan et al., 2012; 23104868, Haberler and W\u00f6hrer, 2014; 24559763, Reuss et al., 2014; 25427834, Sahm et al., 2014; 25143301) and has been proposed as a distinguishing biomarker (Haberler and W\u00f6hrer, 2014; 24559763, Reuss et al., 2014; 25427834, Sahm et al., 2014; 25143301). ATRX mutation has not been detected in concurrence with MYCN amplification in glioma and neuroblastoma (Cheung et al., 2012; 22416102, Molenaar et al., 2012; 22367537, Pugh et al., 2013; 23334666, Cheung and Dyer, 2013; 23702928). Low_grade gliomas with both IDH1/2 mutation and ATRX mutation are associated with worse prognosis than those with IDH1/2 mutation but no ATRX mutation (Haberler and W\u00f6hrer, 2014; 24559763). Loss of ATRX protein expression has been reported in 33_39% of incidences of leiomyosarcoma (LMS) associating with ALT, a poor prognostic factor across all LMS subtypes, and with poor prognosis in extrauterine LMS but not in uterine LMS (Singhi et al., 2015; USCAP Abstract 93)(Liau et al., 2015; 25229770). No targeted therapies are available to directly address ATRX inactivation. Based on preclinical (Liang et al., 2020; 31551363, Garbarino et al., 2021; 34118569) and limited clinical data (Cole et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT059), ATRX alterations may confer sensitivity to combination strategies involving WEE1 inhibition. In a Phase 2 study evaluating the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib plus irinotecan for the treatment of pediatric patients with neuroblastoma, prolonged SD was reported for 44% (4/9) of patients with ATRX_deficient tumors and responses were seen in two tumors that had evidence of ALT (Cole et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT059). Preclinical evidence also suggests that ATRX deficiency may impart sensitivity to synthetic lethal approaches involving PARP inhibition and irinotecan (George et al., 2020; 32846370), combined PARP and ATR inhibition (Garbarino et al., 2021; 34118569), or double_strand break_induction with agents such as doxorubicin, irinotecan, and topotecan (Koschmann et al., 2016; 26936505); however, these approaches have not been demonstrated clinically.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "CDKN2A/B", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "p16INK4a loss and p14ARF loss exons 2_3", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "p16INK4a loss and p14ARF loss exons 2_3"}}, "Interpretation": "CDKN2A encodes two different, unrelated tumor suppressor proteins, p16INK4a and p14ARF, whereas CDKN2B encodes the tumor suppressor p15INK4b (Quelle et al., 1995; 8521522, Sharpless, 2005; 15878778). Both p15INK4b and p16INK4a bind to and inhibit CDK4 and CDK6, thereby maintaining the growth_suppressive activity of the Rb tumor suppressor; loss or inactivation of either p15INK4b or p16INK4a contributes to dysregulation of the CDK4/6_cyclin_Rb pathway and loss of cell cycle control (Gazzeri et al., 1998; 9484839, Roussel, 1999; 10498883).

Loss of expression of p16INK4a has been found in up to 50% of GISTs, and numerous studies have shown that loss of expression of p16INK4a and p14ARF correlates with aggressive disease, worse prognosis, and shorter survival in GIST patients (Haller et al., 2005; 16166437, Schneider_Stock et al., 2005; 15701851, Huang et al., 2006; 17013685, Liang et al., 2007; 17659467, Schmieder et al., 2008; 18813351, Zhang et al., 2010; 20872974). Preclinical data suggest that tumors with loss of p16INK4a function may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, ribociclib, and palbociclib (Konecny et al., 2011; 21278246, Katsumi et al., 2011; 21871868, Cen et al., 2012; 22711607, Logan et al., 2013; 23898052). Although case studies have reported that patients with breast cancer or uterine leiomyosarcoma harboring CDKN2A loss responded to palbociclib treatment (Elvin et al., 2017; 28283584, Gao et al., 2015; 26715889), multiple other clinical studies have shown no significant correlation between p16INK4a loss or inactivation and therapeutic benefit of these agents (Gopalan et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8077, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Konecny et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5557)(DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Johnson et al., 2014; 24797823); it is not known whether CDK4/6 inhibitors would be beneficial in this case. Although preclinical studies have suggested that loss of p14ARF function may be associated with reduced sensitivity to MDM2 inhibitors (Van Maerken et al., 2011; 21460101, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357), the clinical relevance of p14ARF as a predictive biomarker is not clear. Germline CDKN2A mutation is associated with melanoma_pancreatic cancer syndrome, a condition marked by increased risk of developing malignant melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer (Whelan et al., 1995; 7666917). Mutation carriers within families may develop either or both types of cancer, and melanoma cases may be referred to as familial or hereditary melanoma (Hansson, 2010; 20687502, Hogg et al., 1998; 9479083). CDKN2A is the most implicated gene in familial melanoma, with germline mutations present in 16% to 20% of familial melanoma cases (De Unamuno et al., 2018; 29543703, Soura et al., 2016; 26892650, Huerta et al., 2018; 29405243). CDKN2A alteration has also been implicated in familial melanoma_astrocytoma syndrome, an extremely rare tumor association characterized by dual predisposition to melanoma and nervous system tumors (Kaufman et al., 1993; 8414022, Bahuau et al., 1998; 9622062, Chan et al., 2017; 28699883). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of CDKN2A is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI is generally rare in GIST (Campanella et al., 2017; 29113157), although conflicting data have been published (Fukasawa et al., 2000; 11123422). The prognostic significance of MSI in GIST has not been an active area of investigation (PubMed, Feb 2021). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "05", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "05"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB level associated with lower rates of clinical benefit from treatment with PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors compared with patients with tumors harboring higher TMB levels, based on several studies in multiple solid tumor types (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) harbor a median TMB of 2.5 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 0% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of TMB in GIST are limited (PubMed, Sep 2021). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, higher TMB has been reported to be associated with increased ORR and OS from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). Higher TMB was found to be significantly associated with improved OS upon immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment for patients with 9 types of advanced tumors (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254). Analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy, compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386). However, the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors found significant improvement in ORR for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (based on this assay or others) compared to those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb, in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types; similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). Together, these studies suggest that patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb may derive clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1 inhibitors.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "KIT", "Alteration": "W557_K558delV654A", "Title": "ATG_008 Combined With Toripalimab in Advanced Solid Tumors", "StudyPhase": "PHASE null", "Target": "mTORC1, mTORC2, PD_1", "Locations": "Chongqing (China), Chengdu (China)", "NCTID": "NCT04337463", "Note": "KIT amplification or activating mutations may predict sensitivity to small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
