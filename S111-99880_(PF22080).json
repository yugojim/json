Certain MET alterations have been associated with the removal of exon 14 (Kong_Beltran et al., 2006; 16397241, Onozato et al., 2009; 19096300, Okuda et al., 2008; 19037978, Paik et al., 2015; 25971939, Awad et al., 2016; 26729443, Gray et al., 2015; 26637977) and/or loss of a binding site for the ubiquitin ligase CBL, an enzyme that targets MET for degradation (Kong_Beltran et al., 2006; 16397241, Peschard et al., 2004; 15123609, Lee et al., 2014; 23208509, Lee et al., 2006; 17079873). Loss of either MET exon 14 or a CBL binding site increases MET stability, leading to prolonged signaling upon HGF stimulation and increased oncogenic potential (Kong_Beltran et al., 2006; 16397241, Togashi et al., 2015; 26547802, Lee et al., 2014; 23208509, Lee et al., 2006; 17079873, Peschard et al., 2001; 11741535, Abella et al., 2005; 16227611, Gray et al., 2015; 26637977); these mutations are expected to be activating. Responses to various MET inhibitors have been reported for multiple patients with alterations in their tumors predicted to lack MET exon 14 (Drilon et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract OA12.02, Felip et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract OA12.01, Wolf et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract LBA52, Moro_Sibilot et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract OA12.03)(Frampton et al., 2015; 25971938, Paik et al., 2015; 25971939, Schrock et al., 2017; 8315738). In the Phase 2 VISION study of patients with non_small cell lung cancer, MET exon 14 skipping alterations were reported in 3.6% of patients (Le et al., 2020; AACR Abstract 3385). In one study of 4402 lung adenocarcinoma cases, MET mutations (primarily those affecting MET exon 14 splicing) have been reported in 3% of samples (Frampton et al., 2015; 25971938). In TCGA datasets, MET mutation has been observed in 8.3% of lung adenocarcinomas and 2.1% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745). Studies on the effect of MET amplification on prognosis in NSCLC have yielded conflicting results (Yang et al., 2013; 23079155, Dziadziuszko et al., 2012; 22237262, Cappuzzo et al., 2009; 19255323, Park et al., 2012; 22207554, Chen et al., 2011; 22052229, Kanteti et al., 2009; 19817696, To et al., 2002; 11795945, Tsuta et al., 2012; 22198430), although concurrent MET amplification and EGFR mutation have been correlated with reduced disease_free survival (Tanaka et al., 2012; 21733594). MET exon 14 splice alteration, which has predominantly been observed in lung cancer, was found to be an independent poor prognostic factor in a study of 687 patients with NSCLC (Tong et al., 2016; 26847053). However, other studies did not find MET exon 14 splice alteration as a major risk factor for overall survival for NSCLC patients, although recurrence rate was significantly higher in patients with exon 14 splice alteration compared to those with ALK fusion (Lee et al., 2017; 28502721, Gow et al., 2017; 28024701). Among NSCLC patients with exon 14 alterations that had not been previously treated with a MET inhibitor, a non_significant trend for reduced survival was noted in the context of concurrent MET amplification (5.2 vs 10.5 months, p = 0.06) (Awad et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 8511). On the basis of extensive clinical evidence, MET amplification or activating mutations may predict sensitivity to MET_targeting therapies such as kinase inhibitors crizotinib, capmatinib, tepotinib, and cabozantinib. MET inhibitors crizotinib, capmatinib, PF_04217903, tepotinib, glesatinib, savolitinib, and foretinib have provided benefit for patients with MET_mutated papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (Choueiri et al., 2013; 23213094, Diamond et al., 2013; 23610116, Stein et al., 2015; 25457019, Choueiri et al., 2020; 32469384), histiocytic sarcoma (Frampton et al., 2015; 25971938), and non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of varied histologies (Drilon et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract OA12.02, Felip et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract OA12.01, Wolf et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9004, Schuler et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9067, Kollmannsberger et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 2589, Engstrom et al., 2017; 28765324, Paik et al., 2015; 25971939, Mazieres et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 1283P, Jenkins et al., 2015; 25769807, Waqar et al., 2015; 25898962, Mendenhall and Goldman, 2015; 25898965). Patients with MET exon 14 mutated NSCLC who were treated with 1 of several MET inhibitors exhibited superior outcomes (median OS 24.6 vs. 8.1 months; HR=0.11, p=0.04) compared with patients who were not treated with a MET inhibitor (Awad et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 8511). Tepotinib showed durable clinical activity in patients with NSCLC with MET exon 14 skipping mutations (Paik et al., 2020; 32469185, Mazieres et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 1283P), and yielded a PR lasting 9 months for a patient with HLA_DRB1_MET fusion_positive NSCLC (Blanc_Durand et al., 2020; 32716573). In another study, 11 patients with hereditary papillary RCC and germline MET mutations (4 of which were H1094R) experienced 5 PRs and 5 SDs after treatment with foretinib (Choueiri et al., 2013; 23213094). Savolitinib yielded ORRs of 49% (30/61) in patients with MET exon 14 mutated NSCLC (Lu et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 9519) and numerically higher ORR for patients with MET_driven papillary RCC compared to sunitinib (27% [9/33] vs. 7.4% [2/27]) (Choueiri et al., 2020; 32469384). A Phase 1 study for patients with MET_altered NSCLC treated with MET inhibitor bozitinib monotherapy reported an overall ORR of 30.6% (11/36) and DCR of 97.2% (35/36) with MET overexpression, amplification, and exon 14 skipping demonstrating ORRs of 35.7% (5/14), 41.2% (7/17), and 66.7% (10/15), respectively; increased ORRs were observed in patients with both exon 14 skipping and amplification (100%, 4/4) and with both amplification and overexpression (50%, 3/6)(Yang et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT127). A Phase 2 study evaluating the MET inhibitor savolitinib for patients with MET exon 14 splice site mutation_positive pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma and other types of non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) reported that 52% (16/31) of patients achieved a PR (Lu et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT031). In the Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study, patients with NSCLC harboring MET exon 14 skipping mutations treated with amivantamab achieved a 64% (9/14; 5 PRs confirmed, 4 PRs pending) unconfirmed ORR; 4 out of 7 patients previously treated with MET TKIs responded (Spira et al., 2021 WCLC Abstract OA15.03).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Activating MET alterations may confer sensitivity to MET inhibitors.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Crizotinib", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Crizotinib is an inhibitor of the kinases MET, ALK, ROS1, and RON.

TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). High bTMB levels were not detected in this sample. It is unclear whether the bTMB levels in this sample would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Depending on the clinical context, TMB testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. NSCLC harbors a median bTMB of 16.8 Muts/Mb (range 1.9_52.5 Muts/Mb)(Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950). Retrospective analysis of the Phase 3 OAK and Phase 2 POPLAR trials for patients with advanced or metastatic non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) reported that bTMB \u22657 Muts/Mb was associated with shorter PFS (2.8 vs. 4.2 months) and OS (7.4 vs. 11.9 months) compared with bTMB <7 Muts/Mb for patients treated with docetaxel (Nie et al., 2020; 32380463). In one study of advanced NSCLC in China, bTMB \u22656 Muts/Mb was associated with decreased PFS (10 vs. 18 months) and OS (11 vs. 25 months) compared with bTMB <6 Muts/Mb for patients treated with platinum_based chemotherapy (Ma et al., 2021; 34055609). A meta_analysis of 19 studies of immune checkpoint inhibitor_treated NSCLC (n = 2,315 patients) demonstrated that high TMB predicted a significantly longer OS than low TMB (HR = 0.70), and within the high TMB group, immunotherapy was associated with an improved PFS (HR = 0.62, P<0.001), OS (HR = 0.67, P<0.001) and a higher response rate (OR = 2.35, P<0.001) compared to chemotherapy (Meng et al., 2022; 35113949). In contrast, a large study of Chinese patients with untreated lung adenocarcinoma reported a shorter median OS for tumors with a higher number of mutations in a limited gene set compared with a lower mutation number (48.4 vs. 61.0 months)(Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843). Another study of patients with NSCLC treated with EGFR inhibitors or platinum doublet chemotherapy found elevated TMB to be correlated with poorer prognosis, as well as finding lower TMB in combination with PD_L1 negative status to be significantly associated with longer median survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). However, no significant prognostic association of TMB and/or PD_L1 status with survival has been reported in patients with lung SCC (Yu et al., 2019; 30253973, Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB) may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716), anti_PD_1 (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716), and anti_PD_1/CTLA4 therapies (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P). A Phase 2 multi_solid_tumor trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022). In non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single_agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 Muts/Mb_16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "DNMT3A", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Y533C", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Y533C"}}, "Interpretation": "The DNMT3A gene encodes the protein DNA methyltransferase 3A, an enzyme that is involved in the methylation of newly synthesized DNA, a function critical for gene regulation (Trowbridge and Orkin, 2012; 22200773, Ch\u00e9din, 2011; 21507354). The role of DNMT3A in cancer is uncertain, as some reports describe increased expression and contribution to tumor growth, whereas others propose a role for DNMT3A as a tumor suppressor (Yang et al., 2011; 21887466, Vallb\u00f6hmer et al., 2006; 16870044, Daskalos et al., 2011; 21351083, Fabbri et al., 2007; 17890317, Gao et al., 2011; 22011581, Kim et al., 2013; 23031157). Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. DNMT3A alterations have been reported at relatively low frequencies in solid tumors and are more prevalent in hematological malignancies (cBioPortal, Feb 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of DNMT3A alterations in solid tumors are limited (PubMed, Feb 2022). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in DNMT3A in solid tumors. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI_H is generally infrequent in NSCLC, reported in fewer than 1% of samples across several large studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197, Ninomiya et al., 2006; 16641899, Vanderwalde et al., 2018; 29436178, Zang et al., 2019; 31270941, Dudley et al., 2016; 26880610, Takamochi et al., 2017; 28676214, Schrock et al., 2017; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2016.11.487), whereas data on the reported incidence of MSI_H in SCLC has been limited and conflicting (Pylkkanen et al., 1997; 9329646, Gonzalez et al., 2000; 11061602, Chen et al., 1996; 8782463, Merlo et al., 1994; 8174113). One study reported MSI_H in lung adenocarcinoma patients with smoking history, and 3 of 4 MSI_H patients examined also had metachronous carcinomas in other organs, although this has not been investigated in large scale studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of MSI in NSCLC are limited (PubMed, Oct 2021).

The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with elevated tumor fraction values have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus high sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at low risk of false negative results. However, if elevated tumor fraction is not detected, it does not exclude the presence of disease burden or compromise the confidence of reported alterations. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels.
