HRD and consequent genomic LOH occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one or more of the homologous recombination pathway proteins, including BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51C, ATM, PALB2, and BRIP1 (Vanderstichele et al., 2017; 28950147, Watkins et al., 2014; 25093514, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2011; 21720365, Venkitaraman, 2003; 12736286). This sample harbors a genomic LOH score that has been shown to be associated with sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor rucaparib in platinum_sensitive, BRCA1/2 wild_type ovarian, peritoneal, or Fallopian tube carcinoma in both the treatment (Coleman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5540, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594) and maintenance (Coleman et al., 2017; 28916367) settings. In a study of more than 4,000 ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer samples, genomic LOH score \u2265 16% was identified in 24.2% of BRCA1/2 wild_type cases, deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation was identified in an additional 17.2% of cases, and the remaining 58.7% of cases had LOH score < 16% and were BRCA1/2 wild_type (Elvin et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 5512). Among the histological subtypes, LOH score \u2265 16% or BRCA1/2 mutation was reported in 42.4% of serous carcinomas, 37.6% of endometrioid carcinomas, 23.5% of carcinosarcomas, 20.6% of neuroendocrine carcinomas, 13.6% of clear cell carcinomas, and 8.1% of mucinous carcinomas; in BRCA1/2 wild_type samples, the median LOH score was significantly higher in serous as compared with non_serous cases (Elvin et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 5512). In ovarian carcinoma, the median LOH score is significantly higher for BRCA1/2_mutated cases than BRCA1/2 wild_type cases (22.2% vs. 9.8%) (Elvin et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 5512), and mutation or methylation of BRCA1, BRCA2, or RAD51C has been reported to be enriched in cases with increased genomic LOH (Wang et al., 2012; 22912389, Abkevich et al., 2012; 23047548). One study reported no association between LOH and either tumor stage or grade in ovarian serous carcinoma (Marquard et al., 2015; 26015868). In patients with high_grade serous ovarian carcinoma, the frequency of LOH has been reported to increase significantly with age (Pedersen et al., 2013; 23716468). On the basis of emerging clinical data in ovarian cancer, elevated genomic LOH may be associated with greater sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Coleman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5540, Coleman et al., 2017; 28916367, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). In platinum_sensitive, BRCA1/2 wild_type ovarian, peritoneal, or Fallopian tube carcinoma, rucaparib elicited significantly longer median PFS (7.2 vs. 5.0 months, HR=0.51) and improved ORR (33.3% vs. 9.6%, p=0.0003) for patients with LOH score \u2265 16% (Coleman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5540, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). In the maintenance setting in platinum_sensitive, BRCA1/2 wild_type patients, rucaparib was superior to placebo in both the LOH score \u2265 16% (median PFS, 9.7 vs. 5.4 months; HR=0.44) and LOH score < 16% (median PFS, 6.7 vs. 5.4 months; HR=0.58) cohorts (Coleman et al., 2017; 28916367). Similar results have been reported for maintenance treatment with niraparib in ovarian cancer (Mirza et al., 2016; 27717299) when using a different measure of HRD that includes genomic LOH (Telli et al., 2016; 26957554, Timms et al., 2014; 25475740). Increased LOH has also been associated with improved sensitivity to platinum_containing chemotherapy regimens in patients with ovarian or breast cancer (Wang et al., 2012; 22912389, Telli et al., 2015; 25847929, Isakoff et al., 2015; 25847936).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "On the basis of emerging clinical data in ovarian cancer, elevated genomic LOH may be associated with greater sensitivity to PARP inhibitors.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Niraparib", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> The PARP inhibitor niraparib is FDA approved to treat patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, with or without homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)_positive status.

Similarly, the Phase 3 PRIMA trial for patients with newly diagnosed advanced OC reported an extended mPFS from niraparib maintenance therapy after response to first_line platinum chemotherapy compared with placebo (13.8 vs. 8.2 months, HR=0.62); subgroup analysis showed that patients with HRD_positive OC experienced the longest mPFS, which was irrespective of BRCA mutational status (21.9 vs. 10.4 months, HR=0.43) (Gonzalez_Martin et al., 2019; 31562799). The Phase 2 QUADRA study evaluating niraparib monotherapy as late_line treatment for patients with relapsed high_grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer (HGSOC) reported a median OS (mOS) of 12.2 months for all HGSOC patients, with highest mOS seen for those with BRCA1/2_mutated and HRD_positive tumors (26.0 and 19.0 months, respectively) (Moore et al., 2019; 30948273). A Phase 2 trial for patients with platinum_sensitive HGSOC and endometrioid recurrent ovarian cancer reported significantly improved mPFS from the addition of bevacizumab to niraparib compared with niraparib alone (11.9 vs. 5.5 months, HR=0.35) (Mirza et al., 2019; 31474354). In a Phase 1/2 study of niraparib in combination with pembrolizumab for patients with recurrent platinum_resistant OC, patients experienced an ORR of 19% (11/59) and mPFS of 3.4 months; no significant differences in ORR were noted among analyzed subgroups: 14% (3/21) versus 19% (6/32) for patients with HRD_positive versus HRD_negative tumors, 18% (2/11) versus 19% (9/47) for patients with BRCA_mutated versus BRCA_wildtype tumors, and 21% (7/33) versus 10% (2/21) for patients with PD_L1_positive versus PD_L1_negative tumors (Konstantinopoulos et al., 2019; 31194228). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Talazoparib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> The PARP inhibitor talazoparib is FDA approved to treat HER2_negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutations.

Numerous Phase 2 studies have demonstrated significant clinical activity for patients with BRCA_mutated ovarian cancer, with response rates often significantly higher for patients with BRCA mutations than for those without (Fong et al., 2009; 19553641, Gelmon et al., 2011; 21862407), and for patients with platinum_sensitive (vs. platinum_resistant) cancer (Domchek et al., 2016; 26723501, Matulonis et al., 2016; 26961146, Gelmon et al., 2011; 21862407, Fong et al., 2010; 20406929). As maintenance therapy for patients with newly diagnosed or platinum_sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer, olaparib monotherapy demonstrated significantly improved median PFS (mPFS) and OS compared with placebo in the Phase 3 SOLO_1 study (Moore et al., 2018; 30345884) and multiple later_phase studies (Poveda et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6002, Pujade_Lauraine et al., 2017; 28754483, Ledermann et al., 2016; 27617661, Ledermann et al., 2012; 22452356, Ledermann et al., 2014; 24882434). At the 5_year follow_up of SOLO_1, olaparib continued to improve mPFS compared with placebo for patients with ovarian cancer (Banerjee et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 811MO). In the first study of PARPi rechallenge for patients with ovarian cancer, the Phase 3 OReO/ENGOT Ov_38 study of maintenance olaparib compared with placebo reported statistically improved mPFS for both patients with BRCA_mutated (4.3 vs. 2.8 months, HR=0.57) and BRCA_unmutated (5.3 vs. 2.8 months, HR=0.43) cancer; in an exploratory analysis of the BRCA_unmutated cohort, improved mPFS was reported regardless of homologous recombination deficiency status (Pujade_Lauraine et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA33). Olaparib has also been evaluated in combination with other therapies. A statistically superior median PFS from treatment with olaparib in combination with the VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab compared with bevacizumab monotherapy was reported in the Phase 3 PAOLA_1 study for patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer in the intent_to_treat population (PFS: 22.1 vs. 16.6 months), the BRCA1/2_mutated population (PFS: 37.2 vs. 21.7 months), and the BRCA1/2_wildtype population harboring homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)_positive status (PFS: 28.1 vs. 16.6 months) (Ray_Coquard et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA2). For patients with platinum_sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer who previously progressed on chemotherapy, statistically increased median PFS was reported in a Phase 2 study of olaparib in combination with chemotherapy (PFS: 12.2 months) compared with chemotherapy alone (PFS: 9.6 months) (Oza et al., 2014; 25481791), as well as from treatment with the VEGFR inhibitor cediranib compared with olaparib monotherapy in a Phase 1/2 trial (Liu et al., 2014; 25218906). The Phase 2 CAPRI study for PARP inhibitor_resistant patients with HRD, platinum_sensitive, high_grade ovarian cancer treated with combination therapy of olaparib and the ATR inhibitor ceralasertib reported an ORR of 46% (n=13, 6 PRs) and a PFS of 7.5 months (Wethington et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 5516).

RNF43 and the homologous E3 ubiquitin ligase ZNRF3 are tumor suppressors that function as negative regulators of WNT signaling (Hao et al., 2012; 22575959, Koo et al., 2012; 22895187, Jiang et al., 2013; 23847203, Koo et al., 2015; 26023187, Tsukiyama et al., 2015; 25825523). An additional tumor_suppressor_like role for RNF43 in colon cancer is hypothesized to occur via its interaction with the ubiquitin_protein ligase NEDL1, which is predicted to enhance the pro_apoptotic effects of p53 (Shinada et al., 2011; 21108931). Mutations in RNF43 have been reported in 18_27% of endometrial cancers (Kinde et al., 2013; 23303603, Giannakis et al., 2014; 25344691), 3_5% of pancreatic cancers (Madan and Virshup, 2015; 25901018), 21% of ovarian mucinous carcinomas (Ryland et al., 2013; 23096461), 9% of liver fluke_associated cholangiocarcinomas (Ong et al., 2012; 22561520), and up to 18% of colorectal cancers (Giannakis et al., 2014; 25344691, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696). RNF43 mutations are associated with mismatch repair deficiency and microsatellite instability (MSI) in colorectal (Giannakis et al., 2014; 25344691), endometrial (Giannakis et al., 2014; 25344691), and gastric cancers (Wang et al., 2014; 24816253, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317); one study reported RNF43 alterations in more than 50% of MSI gastric carcinomas (Wang et al., 2014; 24816253). Preclinical studies have reported that RNF43 is a negative regulator of WNT signaling, and RNF43 loss or inactivation leads to WNT activation and confers sensitivity to WNT pathway inhibitors, particularly Porcupine inhibitors, in multiple tumor types (Hao et al., 2012; 22575959, Koo et al., 2012; 22895187, Jiang et al., 2013; 23847203, Koo et al., 2015; 26023187, Tsukiyama et al., 2015; 25825523, Cook et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 517MO). In a Phase 1 basket study for the Porcupine inhibitor RXC004, 1 of 2 patients with tumors harboring an RNF43 mutation achieved SD (Cook et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 517MO). Of the patients with WNT_ligand_dependent tumors, including those with RNF43 mutations, RSPO fusions, or those with biliary tract or thymus cancer, 71% (5/7) experienced SD (Cook et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 517MO).

Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 alterations have been reported in 29_80% of ovarian tumors, with a higher incidence in high_grade pelvic (primary ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal) serous carcinoma, with incidence of 91_97% (Ahmed et al., 2010; 20229506, Wojnarowicz et al., 2012; 23029043, Kuhn et al., 2012; 21990067, Karst and Drapkin, 2010; 19746182, Gadducci et al., 2012; 22304686, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011; 21720365, Rechsteiner et al., 2013; 23965232, Okamoto et al., 1991; 1680546). TP53 alterations have also been reported in serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STICs) of the Fallopian tube, which are suggested to be precursor lesions of tubo_ovarian high grade serous carcinomas (MacDaniel et al., 2015; 26181193, Kindelberger et al., 2007; 17255760, Meserve et al., 2017; 28106106, Kurman and Shih, 2011; 21683865). Aberrant p53 expression has been associated with higher ovarian serous carcinoma grade (89_90% of high_grade vs. 6.6_9% of low_grade vs. 0% of benign) (Altman et al., 2013; 23558569, Giurgea et al., 2012; 23303020, Rajesh et al., 2007; 17883046). In one study, p53 expression was not prognostic in regard to outcome in patients with peritoneum serous carcinoma (Lee et al., 2013; 24071870). TP53 mutations have been reported to be more frequent in advanced stage (63%, 55/87) and higher grade (65%, 42/64) than earlier stage (31%, 14/45) and lower grade (41%, 7/17) ovarian carcinomas (Rechsteiner et al., 2013; 23965232). Meta_analysis has suggested that TP53 expression was associated with poorer survival in ovarian epithelial cancers, although the effect was modest and considerable variability was observed between studies (de Graeff et al., 2009; 19513073). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may also be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as APR_246 (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571, Lehmann et al., 2012; 22965953, Mohell et al., 2015; 26086967, Franssonet al., 2016; 27179933). In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, APR_246 combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Mar 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "TP53 loss of function alterations may predict sensitivity to WEE1 inhibitors.

Preclinical studies have suggested that EMSY binds to and suppresses the function of BRCA2, and EMSY overexpression may therefore mimic BRCA2 inactivation (Cousineau and Belmaaza, 2011; 21409565, Hughes_Davies et al., 2003; 14651845). Amplification of the EMSY gene correlates with increased mRNA expression (Wilkerson et al., 2011; 21735447, van Hattem et al., 2008; 18787609), although conflicting data have been reported (Shih et al., 2005; 16172393). The functional consequences of other EMSY alterations have not been extensively studied (PubMed, 2022). In the TCGA datasets, EMSY amplification has been most frequently observed in ovarian carcinoma (8%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2011; 21720365), breast invasive carcinoma (6%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 23000897), esophageal carcinoma (5%)(cBioPortal, 2022), and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (3.5%)(HNSCC_Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2015; 25631445, Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). EMSY overexpression has been primarily reported in breast and high grade ovarian cancers, where it is implicated in BRCA2 inactivation and correlates with poor prognosis or advanced disease (Wilkerson et al., 2011; 21735447, Brown et al., 2008; 18314909, Brown et al., 2010; 19636701, Altinisik et al., 2011; 20349280, Madjd et al., 2014; 24641409, Bane et al., 2011; 21327470, Rodriguez et al., 2004; 15355907, Hughes_Davies et al., 2003; 14651845). The consequences of EMSY alterations in other solid tumors or hematologic malignancies have not been studied in detail in the scientific literature (PubMed, 2022). EMSY overexpression in breast cancer cell lines has been reported to mimic the effects of inactivating BRCA2 mutations (Cousineau and Belmaaza, 2011; 21409565). Unlike BRCA2 inactivation, which predicts sensitivity to DNA repair_associated inhibitors such as the PARP inhibitor olaparib (Dedes et al., 2011; 21487248, Ihnen et al., 2013; 23729402), EMSY amplification in breast cancer lines was not associated with enhanced sensitivity to this drug in one preclinical study (Wilkerson et al., 2011; 21735447).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI_high (MSI_H) has been reported in 1.6_19.7% of ovarian cancer samples (Segev et al., 2015; 26775351, Plisiecka_Ha\u0142asa et al., 2008; 18507046), including 3.8% (1/26) of ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinomas (Huang et al., 2015; 25195947), and 10.0% (3/30) of ovarian clear cell carcinomas (CCOCs) (Strickland et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5514). No association of MSI_H with stage or survival was found in patients with ovarian cancer (Segev et al., 2015; 26775351, Aysal et al., 2012; 22189970). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "06", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "06"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen.

This sample harbors a TMB level associated with lower rates of clinical benefit from treatment with PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors compared with patients with tumors harboring higher TMB levels, based on several studies in multiple solid tumor types (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). Ovarian carcinomas, including peritoneal and Fallopian tube carcinomas, harbor a median TMB of 2.7_3.6 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb) depending upon subtype, and up to 2.1% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). In a study of high grade serous ovarian cancer, homologous recombination (HR)_deficient tumors, which comprised ~50% of all samples, harbored a higher neoantigen load compared to HR_proficient tumors; higher neoantigen load was associated with longer OS but not disease free survival (Strickland et al., 2016; 26871470). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, increased tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Ott et al., 2019; 30557521, Cristescu et al., 2022; 35101941, Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). In the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors, significant improvement in ORR was observed for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) compared with those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526); similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). At the same TMB cutpoint, retrospective analysis of patients with solid tumors treated with any checkpoint inhibitor identified that tissue TMB scores \u2265 10 Muts/Mb were associated with prolonged time to treatment failure compared with scores <10 muts/Mb (HR=0.68) (Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). For patients with solid tumors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the CheckMate 848 trial, improved responses were observed in patients with a tissue TMB \u2265 10 Muts/Mb independent of blood TMB at any cutpoint in matched samples (Schenker at al., 2022; AACR Abstract 7845). However, support for higher TMB thresholds and efficacy was observed in the prospective Phase 2 MyPathway trial of atezolizumab for patients with pan_solid tumors, where improved ORR and DCR was seen in patients with TMB \u2265 16 Muts/Mb than those with TMB \u2265 10 and <16 Muts/Mb (Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409). Similarly, analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017;
