Activating mutations in RAS genes can cause uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor formation (Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Kahn et al., 1987; 3310850). Clinical benefit has been reported for patients with KRAS G12C_mutated solid tumors following treatment with G12C inhibitors such as sotorasib (Canon et al., 2019; 31666701, Lanman et al., 2020; 31820981, Hong et al., 2020; 32955176) or adagrasib (Hallin et al., 2019; 31658955, Janne et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 3LBA, Johnson et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 4LBA). However, clinical and preclinical resistance to G12C inhibitors, either by emergence of additional alterations in KRAS or other genes in the RTK/MAPK/PI3K pathway, have also been observed (Awad et al., 2021; 34161704, Tanaka et al., 2021; 33824136, Ryan et al., 2020; 31776128, Dunnett_Kane et al., 2021; 33466360). KRAS alterations affecting amino acids G12, G13, Q22, P34, A59, Q61, and A146, as well as mutations G10_A11insG, G10_A11insAG (also reported as G10_A11dup and G12_G13insAG), A18D, L19F, D33E, G60_A66dup/E62_A66dup, E62K, R68S, and K117N have been characterized as activating and oncogenic (Akagi et al., 2007; 17150185, Bollag et al., 1996; 8955068, Buhrman et al., 2010; 20194776, Colicelli, 2004; 15367757, Edkins et al., 2006; 16969076, Feig and Cooper, 1988; 3043178, Gremer et al., 2011; 20949621, Janakiraman et al., 2010; 20570890, Kim et al., 2016; 27147599, Lukman et al., 2010; 20838576, Naguib et al., 2011; 21371307, Prior et al., 2012; 22589270, Priv\u00e9 et al., 1992; 1565661, Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Scheffzek et al., 1997; 9219684, Scholl et al., 2009; 19490892, Smith et al., 2010; 20147967, Tyner et al., 2009; 19075190, Valencia et al., 1991; 2029511, White et al., 2016; 26854029, Wiest et al., 1994; 8058307, Kim et al., 2016; 27147599, Angeles et al., 2019; 31289513, Tong et al., 2014; 24642870, Loree et al., 2021; 34117033). KRAS G12C mutations have been identified in 1.0% of pancreatic cancers (Nassar et al., 2021; 33497555). KRAS mutations have been observed in 91_95% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cases (cBio_Biankin et al., 2012; 23103869, cBio_Witkiewicz et al., 2015; 25855536), with the majority of mutations found at codon 12 (Feldmann et al., 2007; 17520196, Rachakonda et al., 2013; 23565280, Hruban et al., 1993; 8342602, Maitra et al., 2006; 16549325). KRAS mutations, particularly G12D, have been associated with decreased median survival time in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Rachakonda et al., 2013; 23565280). In a Phase 1 study evaluating the MEK_pan_RAF dual inhibitor CH5126766, 6 patients harboring KRAS mutations experienced PRs, including 3 with non_small cell lung cancer (NCSLC), 1 with low_grade serous ovarian carcinoma (LGSOC), 1 with endometrial adenocarcinoma, and 1 with multiple myeloma (Guo et al., 2020; 3312887). Another Phase 1 study of CH5126766 combined with the FAK inhibitor defactinib reported 4 PRs in KRAS_mutated LGSOC (Shinde et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT143). KRAS G12C may predict sensitivity to G12C_targeted inhibitors such as sotorasib (Canon et al., 2019; 31666701, Lanman et al., 2020; 31820981, Hong et al., 2020; 32955176) and adagrasib (Hallin et al., 2019; 31658955, Janne et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 3LBA, Johnson et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 4LBA). The Phase 1 CodeBreaK 100 trial of sotorasib in G12C_mutated solid tumors observed clinical benefit for patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and colorectal cancer (CRC), with additional responses observed in several other tumor types (Hong et al., 2020; 32955176); patients with CRC achieved a relatively low ORR (7.1% [3/42]) but demonstrated a high DCR of 74% (31/42) with mPFS of 4 months (Hong et al., 2020; 32955176). In the Phase 1/2 KRYSTAL_1 trial, treatment with single_agent adagrasib elicited a 45% (23/51) ORR and a 96% (49/51) DCR for patients with G12C_mutated NSCLC (Janne et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 3LBA). Responses to single_agent adagrasib were also reported for patients with other types of G12C_mutated tumors, including CRC with an ORR of 17% (3/18) and individual responses reported for patients with endometrial cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, and cholangiocarcinoma (Johnson et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 4LBA). Preclinical data suggests that sotorasib in combination with the EGFR inhibitor cetuximab may lead to more effective suppression of KRAS G12C_mutated CRC tumors (Amodio et al., 2020; 32430388). Preclinical and clinical data suggest that KRAS mutations may predict clinical benefit from SHP2 inhibitors (Lu et al., 2019; 31068384, Mainardi et al., 2018; 29808006, Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001, Brana et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3005, Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). A Phase 1 study of RMC_4630 for relapsed/refractory solid tumors reported a DCR of 58% (23/40) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS mutations and a DCR of 75% (12/16) for patients with NSCLC and KRAS G12C mutations (Koczywas et al., 2021; AACR Abstract LB001). Interim results from a Phase 1/2 study of RMC_4630 plus cobimetinib reported tumor reduction in 3 of 8 patients with KRAS_mutated colorectal cancer (Bendell et al., 2020; EORTC_NCI_AACR Abstract 5). Preclinical evidence suggests that KRAS activation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, such as trametinib, binimetinib, cobimetinib, and selumetinib (Nakano et al., 1984; 6320174, Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Yamaguchi et al., 2011; 21523318, Watanabe et al., 2013; 23438367, Gilmartin et al., 2011; 21245089, Yeh et al., 2009; 19372556). Initial Phase 1 monotherapy trials of MEK inhibitors in patients with pancreatic cancer showed promise, with DCR (PR and/or SD) up to 37% (Bodoky et al., 2012; 21594619), response rates up to 25% (Rosen et al., 2008; ASCO Abstract 14585, Rinehart et al., 2004; 15483017, LoRusso et al., 2005; 16009947, Bodoky et al., 2012; 21594619, Infante et al., 2012; 22805291, Weekes et al., 2013; 23434733), and prolonged PRs in certain patients (Rinehart et al., 2004; 15483017, Infante et al., 2012; 22805291, Garrido_Laguna et al., 2015; 25897431). However, subsequent clinical trials combining various MEK inhibitors with gemcitabine reported no additional benefit compared to gemcitabine alone irrespective of KRAS mutation status (Van Laethem et al., 2017; 27975152, Infante et al., 2013; 23583440, Infante et al., 2014; 24915778, Van Cutsem et al., 2018; 29756206), with refametinib and gemcitabine even showing a trend towards worse response and survival in patients with KRAS_mutant pancreatic tumors than in those with KRAS wild_type tumors (OS 6.6 months vs 18.2 months) (Van Laethem et al., 2017; 27975152). Trials combining MEK inhibitors with other targeted therapies, such as EGFR inhibitors (Ko et al., 2016; 26251290) or PI3K_AKT pathway inhibitors (LoRusso et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract 2566, Juric et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 9051, Chung et al., 2017; 27978579, Bedard et al., 2015; 25500057), reported no PRs and frequent adverse events in patients with KRAS_mutant pancreatic cancer. Emerging preclinical studies suggest MEK inhibition downstream of KRAS_mutant pancreatic tumors leads to increased autophagy (Kinsey et al., 2019; 30833748, Bryant et al., 2019; 30833752). Combination MEK/autophagy inhibitors may therefore be more beneficial. A heavily pretreated patient with pancreatic cancer treated with trametinib plus hydroxychloroquine exhibited a PR (Kinsey et al., 2019; 30833748). A Phase 2 trial of paclitaxel/carboplatin with or without Reolysin in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma reported no improvement in PFS with addition of Reolysin, regardless of KRAS mutational status (Noonan et al., 2016; 27039845); however a Phase 2 study of Reolysin and gemcitabine in patents with pancreatic cancer reported 1 PR, 23 SDs, and 5 PDs in 34 patients with a favorable median OS of 10.2 months (Mahalingam et al., 2018; 29799479). Preclinical data suggest that KRAS mutation may confer sensitivity to SOS1 inhibitors (Hillig et al., 2019; 30683722, Hofmann et al., 2021; 32816843, Gerlach et al., 2020; AACR Abstract 1091). Phase 1 studies of the SOS1 inhibitor BI 1701963 alone or in combination with MEK inhibitors, KRAS G12C inhibitors, or irinotecan are recruiting for patients with solid tumors harboring KRAS mutations (Hofmann et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT210, Gort et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract TPS3651).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Clinical evidence suggests that patients with the KRAS G12C mutation may be sensitive to G12C_targeted inhibitors such as sotorasib and adagrasib.

Multiple clinical studies have reported lack of efficacy of MEK inhibitors as monotherapy for treatment of KRAS_mutant pancreatic cancer.

High bTMB levels were not detected in this sample. It is unclear whether the bTMB levels in this sample would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Depending on the clinical context, TMB testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. Average bTMB levels in solid tumors other than NSCLC have not been evaluated (cBioPortal, COSMIC, PubMed, Mar 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of bTMB levels in pancreatic carcinoma are limited (PubMed, Jul 2021). A study of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma harboring mismatch repair gene mutations reported improved prognosis for patients with high TMB measured in tissue samples (defined as >50 mutations; survival 69_314 months) compared to those with lower TMB (average of 5.7 mutations; 10_42 months) (Hu et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract e15791). On the basis of clinical evidence in NSCLC and HSNCC, increased bTMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511) and anti_PD_1 (Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074) therapies. In NSCLC, multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 to 16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). In HNSCC, a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Cannot Be Determined", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Cannot Be Determined"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI is rare in pancreatic carcinoma, reported in less than 1% of samples (n=>1,000)(Hu et al., 2018; 29367431, Campbell et al., 2017; 29056344, Pihlak et al., 2018; 29329208, Salem et al., 2018; 29523759, Lahgi et al., 2012; 23029359). The prognostic significance of MSI in pancreatic cancer is unknown (PubMed, Aug 2021). On the basis of prospective clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD_1_targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143) and PD_L1_targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92). As the MSI status of this tumor is unknown, the relevance of these therapeutic approaches is unclear. While approximately 80% of MSI_H tumors arise due to somatic inactivation of an MMR pathway protein, about 20% arise due to germline mutations in one of the MMR genes (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942), which are associated with a condition known as Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC) (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756). Lynch syndrome leads to an increased risk of colorectal, endometrial, gastric, and other cancers (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756, Pande et al., 2012; 22714864, Kastrinos and Syngal, 2007; 17920897) and has an estimated prevalence in the general population ranging from 1:600 to 1:2000 (Silva et al., 2009; 19466295, Sehgal et al., 2014; 24978665, de la Chapelle et al., 2005; 16136383).

Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with elevated tumor fraction values have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus high sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at low risk of false negative results. However, if elevated tumor fraction is not detected, it does not exclude the presence of disease burden or compromise the confidence of reported alterations. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels. In the research setting, changes in tumor fraction estimates have been associated with treatment duration and clinical response and may be a useful indicator for future cancer management (Bronkhorst et al., 2019; 30923679, Raja et al., 2018; 30093454, Hrebien et al., 2019; 30860573, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5039, Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Goodall et al., 2017; 28450425, Goldberg et al., 2018; 29330207).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "KRAS", "Alteration": "G12C", "Title": "A Phase 1/2, Study Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, PK, and Efficacy of AMG 510 in Subjects With Solid Tumors With a Specific KRAS Mutation.", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1/2", "Target": "KRAS, PD_1, PD_L1", "Locations": "Fukuoka_shi (Japan), Matsuyama_shi (Japan), Seoul (Korea, Republic of), Wakayama_shi (Japan), Osaka_shi (Japan), Hirakata_shi (Japan), Nagoya_shi (Japan), Sunto_gun (Japan), Yokohama_shi (Japan), Kawasaki_shi (Japan)", "NCTID": "NCT03600883", "Note": "Clinical evidence suggests that patients with the KRAS G12C mutation may be sensitive to G12C_targeted inhibitors such as sotorasib and adagrasib.
