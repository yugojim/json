AKT2 is one of three members of the AKT gene family, and activation of AKT2 has been implicated in multiple malignancies (Liu et al., 1998; 9679957, Vivanco and Sawyers., 2002; 12094235). AKT isoforms appear to have different roles in tumorigenesis; AKT1 appears to contribute to the initiation of tumors, whereas AKT2 promotes invasion and metastasis in breast tumors (Chin and Toker., 2011; 21519185). Although AKT2 amplification has been reported to associate with AKT2 overexpression (Cheng et al., 1992; 1409633, Thompson et al., 1996; 8646743, Altomare and Testa., 2005; 16288292), studies in various cancers suggest that AKT2 phosphorylation may have greater clinical relevance than AKT2 amplification or mRNA overexpression (Cicenas., 2008; 18409144, Scrima et al., 2012; 22363436). AKT2 amplification has been reported frequently in ovarian (De Marco et al., 2013; 23408974, Thompson et al., 1996; 8646743, Cheng et al., 1992; 1409633) and Fallopian tube carcinomas (Snijders et al., 2003; 12833150). In the TCGA dataset, amplification of AKT2 has been found in 7% of ovarian serous carcinoma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2011; 21720365). Higher AKT2 expression has been reported to be associated with longer PFS in epithelial ovarian and primary peritoneal carcinomas (Schilder et al., 2008; 18612157). Amplification or activation of AKT2 may promote AKT_mTOR pathway activation and may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of the AKT and downstream mTOR pathways. Clinical benefit has been achieved in 1 patient with AKT2 amplification treated with an mTOR inhibitor (Basho et al., 2017; 27893038). In preclinical studies, the AKT inhibitor MK_2206 showed evidence of enhancing anti_tumor activity of other chemotherapeutic agents in lung and ovarian tumor cells (Hirai et al., 2010; 20571069).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "AKT2 amplification or mutation may lead to AKT_mTOR pathway activation and may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT03239015", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04803318", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05125523", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03772561", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04551521", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03297606", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05036226", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03673787", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05276973", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT01582191", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "CDK4", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "true", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "CDK4 encodes the cyclin_dependent kinase 4, which regulates the cell cycle, senescence, and apoptosis (reviewed in Choi et al., 2014; 23644662). CDK4 and its functional homolog CDK6 are activated by D_type cyclins and promote cell cycle progression by inactivating the tumor suppressor Rb (Weinberg et al., 1995; 7736585, Musgrove et al., 2011; 21734724). Amplification of the chromosomal region that includes CDK4 has been reported in multiple cancer types, including lung cancer, glioblastoma, and liposarcoma, and has been associated with overexpression of CDK4 protein (Wikman et al., 2005; 15543620, Rao et al., 2010; 19609742, Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Chung et al., 2009; 19574885, Ragazzini et al., 2004; 15024701, Dujardin et al., 2011; 21336260, Zhang et al., 2013; 23393200, Horvai et al., 2009; 19734852). CDK4 amplification has been reported in 0.4_1.0% of high_grade ovarian serous carcinomas (cBio_Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359, cBio_Nguyen et al., 2022; 35120664, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011; 21720365). Overexpression of CDK4 mRNA has been reported in 14% (7/48) of ovarian carcinomas in one study, although CDK4 amplification was not observed (Masciullo et al., 1997; 9291427). Immunohistochemical analysis of 103 samples of ovarian tumors showed that 61% of benign tumors, 70% of borderline tumors, and 74% of malignant tumors expressed CDK4 (Sui et al., 2000; 11063650). Alteration in the p16_cyclin D1/CDK4_Rb pathway was found to be predictive of lower overall survival in a study of 107 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (Hashiguchi et al., 2004; 14991533). However, in a study of 103 ovarian tumors, no significant correlation was observed between CDK4 protein expression and overall survival unless p16 expression was also decreased, in which case overall survival was lower (Sui et al., 2000; 11063650). CDK4 amplification or activation may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors such as abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib (Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27217383, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767). Clinical benefit has been reported for limited tumor types including patients with CDK4_amplified liposarcoma and sarcoma in response to treatment with abemaciclib (Dickson et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 11004), palbociclib (Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Dickson et al., 2016; 27124835), and ribociclib (Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04282031", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04553133", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03239015", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04557449", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02693535", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05262400", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03297606", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03994796", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05252416", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02896335", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "H168R", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "77.96", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "H168R"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 alterations have been reported in 29_80% of ovarian tumors, with a higher incidence in high_grade pelvic (primary ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal) serous carcinoma, with incidence of 91_97% (Ahmed et al., 2010; 20229506, Wojnarowicz et al., 2012; 23029043, Kuhn et al., 2012; 21990067, Karst and Drapkin, 2010; 19746182, Gadducci et al., 2012; 22304686, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011; 21720365, Rechsteiner et al., 2013; 23965232, Okamoto et al., 1991; 1680546). Aberrant p53 expression has been associated with higher ovarian serous carcinoma grade (89_90% of high_grade vs. 6.6_9% of low_grade vs. 0% of benign) (Altman et al., 2013; 23558569, Giurgea et al., 2012; 23303020, Rajesh et al., 2007; 17883046). TP53 mutations have been reported to be more frequent in advanced stage (63%, 55/87) and higher grade (65%, 42/64) than earlier stage (31%, 14/45) and lower grade (41%, 7/17) ovarian carcinomas (Rechsteiner et al., 2013; 23965232). Meta_analysis has suggested that TP53 expression was associated with poorer survival in ovarian epithelial cancers, although the effect was modest and considerable variability was observed between studies (de Graeff et al., 2009; 19513073). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "TP53 loss of function alterations may predict sensitivity to WEE1 inhibitors.

One study has demonstrated a weak but significant association between ERBB3 gene amplification and ERBB3 protein expression in breast cancer tissue (Sassen et al., 2008; 18182100). In the Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma TCGA dataset, ERBB3 amplification and mutation were detected in 4% and <1% of cases, respectively (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2011; 21720365). In the literature, overexpression of ERBB3 protein has been detected in 53_76% of ovarian carcinomas (Davies et al., 2014; 24901400, Tanner et al., 2006; 16896008). ERBB3 protein overexpression in ovarian cancer has been correlated with poor prognosis (Tanner et al., 2006; 16896008, Leng et al., 1997; 11324501, Sithanandam and Anderson, 2008; 18404164). ERBB3 cooperates with other ERBB family members, in particular ERBB2, for efficient signaling (Black et al., 2019; 31351986, Baselga and Swain, 2009; 19536107, Jaiswal et al., 2013; 23680147, Jura et al., 2009; 20007378). Therefore, ERBB3 amplification or activating mutation may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting ERBB2, including antibodies such as trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and ado_trastuzumab emtansine (T_DM1), and dual EGFR/HER2 TKIs such as lapatinib and afatinib. Clinical and preclinical data support sensitivity of ERBB3 activating mutations to various anti_ERBB2 agents (Choudhury et al., 2016; 27044931, Verlingue et al., 2018; 29413684, Bidard et al., 2015; 25953157, Jaiswal et al., 2013; 23680147, Umelo et al., 2016; 26689995, Mishra et al., 2018; 29963236), but data are generally limited for ERBB3 amplification. Biomarker analyses of several Phase 3 trials have not identified an association of ERBB3 expression levels with benefit from trastuzumab_, pertuzumab_, or T_DM1_containing regimens in HER2_positive breast cancer (Perez et al., 2019; 31146717, Baselga et al., 2014; 25332247, Kim et al., 2016; 27428671, Baselga et al., 2016; 26920887), T_DM1 in HER2_positive gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer (Shah et al., 2019; 30706247), pertuzumab combined with chemotherapy in ovarian cancer (Kurzeder et al., 2016; 27269942), or afatinib in HNSCC (Cohen et al., 2017; 28961833). Similarly, ERBB3 expression levels were not associated with PFS or OS from lapatinib plus capecitabine in a Phase 2 study of gastric/GEJ cancer (LaBonte et al., 2016; 27325685) or in retrospective studies of HER2_positive breast cancer (Nishimura et al., 2017; 28478451, Duchnowska et al., 2017; 29262628, Fabi et al., 2013; 23472669).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "GATA6", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "GATA6 encodes a zinc finger transcription factor, which is involved in the development of several tissues and is expressed in proliferating cells throughout the intestinal tract (Zheng et al., 2010; 21779441).

Amplification of the GATA6 locus, 18q11.2, has been reported with highest incidences in esophageal adenocarcinomas (21%, 18/85) and pancreatobiliary carcinomas (19%, 7/37)(Lin et al., 2012; 22375031, Kwei et al., 2008; 18535672), and at lower rates in small intestine cancer (5.5%)(Takeda et al., 2022; ASCO GI Abstract 642), urothelial bladder carcinoma (3.9%), lung adenocarcinoma (1.7%), and ovarian carcinoma (1.8%)(cBio_The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014; 24476821, cBio_The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014; 25079552, cBio_The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011; 21720365).

Patients with GATA6_high pancreatic tumors exhibited better clinical outcomes following treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy (p=0.003) or first_line folfirinox (HR=1.90, p=0.025) treatment compared with low GATA6 expressing tumors, while no difference was observed for patients treated with gemcitabine (Duan et al., 2021; 34294813, Martinelli et al., 2017; 27325420).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Homologous Recombination status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "HRD Not Detected", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "HRD Not Detected"}}, "Interpretation": null, "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Loss of Heterozygosity score", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "LOH_Low", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "LOH_Low"}}, "Interpretation": "The loss of heterozygosity (LOH) score is a profile of the percentage of the tumor genome that is under focal loss of one allele (Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594); focal LOH events accumulate as genomic \"scars\" as a result of incorrect DNA double_strand break repair when the homologous recombination pathway is deficient (HRD) (Abkevich et al., 2012; 23047548, Wang et al., 2012; 22912389, Watkins et al., 2014; 25093514, Vanderstichele et al., 2017; 28950147). HRD and consequent genomic LOH occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one or more of the homologous recombination pathway proteins, including BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51C, ATM, PALB2, and BRIP1 (Vanderstichele et al., 2017; 28950147, Watkins et al., 2014; 25093514, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2011; 21720365, Venkitaraman, 2003; 12736286). This sample harbors a genomic LOH score below levels that have been associated with improved rates of clinical benefit from treatment with the PARP inhibitor rucaparib in patients with platinum_sensitive, BRCA1/2 wild_type ovarian, peritoneal, or Fallopian tube carcinoma (Coleman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5540, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). However, patients with lower genomic LOH have also responded to rucaparib, and this type of LOH score does not preclude benefit from PARP inhibitors (Coleman et al., 2017; 28916367, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). In a study of more than 4,000 ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer samples, genomic LOH score \u2265 16% was identified in 24.2% of BRCA1/2 wild_type cases, deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation was identified in an additional 17.2% of cases, and the remaining 58.7% of cases had LOH score < 16% and were BRCA1/2 wild_type (Elvin et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 5512). Among the histological subtypes, LOH score \u2265 16% or BRCA1/2 mutation was reported in 42.4% of serous carcinomas, 37.6% of endometrioid carcinomas, 23.5% of carcinosarcomas, 20.6% of neuroendocrine carcinomas, 13.6% of clear cell carcinomas, and 8.1% of mucinous carcinomas; in BRCA1/2 wild_type samples, the median LOH score was significantly higher in serous as compared with non_serous cases (Elvin et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 5512). In ovarian carcinoma, the median LOH score is significantly higher for BRCA1/2_mutated cases than BRCA1/2 wild_type cases (22.2% vs. 9.8%) (Elvin et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 5512), and mutation or methylation of BRCA1, BRCA2, or RAD51C has been reported to be enriched in cases with increased genomic LOH (Wang et al., 2012; 22912389, Abkevich et al., 2012; 23047548). One study reported no association between LOH and either tumor stage or grade in ovarian serous carcinoma (Marquard et al., 2015; 26015868). In patients with high_grade serous ovarian carcinoma, the frequency of LOH has been reported to increase significantly with age (Pedersen et al., 2013; 23716468). On the basis of emerging clinical data in ovarian cancer, elevated genomic LOH may be associated with greater sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Coleman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5540, Coleman et al., 2017; 28916367, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). In platinum_sensitive, BRCA1/2 wild_type ovarian, peritoneal, or Fallopian tube carcinoma, rucaparib elicited significantly longer median PFS (7.2 vs. 5.0 months, HR=0.51) and improved ORR (33.3% vs. 9.6%, p=0.0003) for patients with LOH score \u2265 16% (Coleman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5540, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). In the maintenance setting in platinum_sensitive, BRCA1/2 wild_type patients, rucaparib was superior to placebo in both the LOH score \u2265 16% (median PFS, 9.7 vs. 5.4 months; HR=0.44) and LOH score < 16% (median PFS, 6.7 vs. 5.4 months; HR=0.58) cohorts (Coleman et al., 2017; 28916367). Similar results have been reported for maintenance treatment with niraparib in ovarian cancer (Mirza et al., 2016; 27717299) when using a different measure of HRD that includes genomic LOH (Telli et al., 2016; 26957554, Timms et al., 2014; 25475740). Increased LOH has also been associated with improved sensitivity to platinum_containing chemotherapy regimens in patients with ovarian or breast cancer (Wang et al., 2012; 22912389, Telli et al., 2015; 25847929, Isakoff et al., 2015; 25847936).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI_high (MSI_H) has been reported in 1.6_19.7% of ovarian cancer samples (Segev et al., 2015; 26775351, Plisiecka_Ha\u0142asa et al., 2008; 18507046), including 3.8% (1/26) of ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinomas (Huang et al., 2015; 25195947), and 10.0% (3/30) of ovarian clear cell carcinomas (CCOCs) (Strickland et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5514). No association of MSI_H with stage or survival was found in patients with ovarian cancer (Segev et al., 2015; 26775351, Aysal et al., 2012; 22189970). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "00", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "00"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB level associated with lower rates of clinical benefit from treatment with PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors compared with patients with tumors harboring higher TMB levels, based on several studies in multiple solid tumor types (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). Ovarian carcinomas, including peritoneal and Fallopian tube carcinomas, harbor a median TMB of 2.7_3.6 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb) depending upon subtype, and up to 2.1% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). In a study of high grade serous ovarian cancer, homologous recombination (HR)_deficient tumors, which comprised ~50% of all samples, harbored a higher neoantigen load compared to HR_proficient tumors; higher neoantigen load was associated with longer OS but not disease free survival (Strickland et al., 2016; 26871470). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, increased tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Ott et al., 2019; 30557521, Cristescu et al., 2022; 35101941, Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). In the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors, significant improvement in ORR was observed for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) compared with those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526); similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). At the same TMB cutpoint, retrospective analysis of patients with solid tumors treated with any checkpoint inhibitor identified that tissue TMB scores \u2265 10 Muts/Mb were associated with prolonged time to treatment failure compared with scores <10 muts/Mb (HR=0.68) (Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). For patients with solid tumors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the CheckMate 848 trial, improved responses were observed in patients with a tissue TMB \u2265 10 Muts/Mb independent of blood TMB at any cutpoint in matched samples (Schenker at al., 2022; AACR Abstract 7845). However, support for higher TMB thresholds and efficacy was observed in the prospective Phase 2 MyPathway trial of atezolizumab for patients with pan_solid tumors, where improved ORR and DCR was seen in patients with TMB \u2265 16 Muts/Mb than those with TMB \u2265 10 and <16 Muts/Mb (Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409). Similarly, analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017;
