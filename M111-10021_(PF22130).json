In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). Amplification of EGFR has been associated with increased expression of EGFR mRNA and protein in several cancer types (Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Bhargava et al., 2005; 15920544, Yang et al., 2012; 22490401). EGFR L858 is located in the kinase domain and is encoded by exon 21. EGFR L858R has been characterized as activating (Lynch et al., 2004; 15118073, Paez et al., 2004; 15118125, Pao et al., 2004; 15329413) and patients with the L858R mutation have been shown to be sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as erlotinib, gefitinib (Lynch et al., 2004; 15118073, Paez et al., 2004; 15118125, Pao et al., 2004; 15329413), and afatinib (Yang et al., 2015; 25589191). EGFR mutation has been reported in 12_36% of lung adenocarcinomas (Vallee et al., 2013; 23934203, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552) and in 4% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745). Amplification of EGFR has been variously reported in 4_42% of non_small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) samples (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745, Park et al., 2012; 22207554, Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Grob et al., 2013; 23238037). EGFR protein expression/overexpression has been reported in up to 70% of NSCLC cases (Watzka et al., 2010; 20353893, Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Grob et al., 2013; 23238037, Park et al., 2012; 22207554, Dobashi et al., 2011; 21040950, Ludovini et al., 2013; 23314677). In addition, expression of EGFR protein has been shown to be higher in lung squamous cell carcinoma samples as compared to lung adenocarcinoma (Skrzypski et al., 2013; 23870818, Kim et al., 2012; 22419022). In patients with lung adenocarcinoma, EGFR gene amplification was a predictor of poor disease_free survival (Lee et al., 2013; 23525704). In patients with lung adenocarcinoma, EGFR mutation was a predictor of poor overall survival (Lee et al., 2013; 23525704, Oakley and Chiosea, 2011; 21587084). However, EGFR mutations have been reported to predict improved survival in patients with resected Stage 1_3 lung adenocarcinoma (Marks et al., 2008; 18303429) or resected Stage 1 NSCLC (Izar et al., 2013; 23932319). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EGFR activating mutations may predict sensitivity to EGFR\u2013TKIs, including erlotinib (Rosell et al., 2011; 22285168), gefitinib (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064, Hayashi et al., 2020; 32673682, Cao et al., 2018; 29780256, Yang et al., 2011; 21422421), afatinib (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960, Bao_Dong Qin et al., 2018; 30127622, Frega et al., 2016; 27131295, Long et al., 2020; 33116645), dacomitinib (Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), and osimertinib (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549, Bao_Dong Qin et al., 2018; 30127622); however, the data for patients with other tumor types are limited (Hong et al., 2020; 32749686, Kim et al., 2015; 26462025, Kim et al., 2015; 25424851, Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840, Cavalieri et al., 2018; 29734047, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Audet et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 6041). EGFR amplification or expression in patients with non_small cell lung cancer may be associated with benefit from the anti_EGFR antibodies cetuximab (Pirker et al., 2011; 22056021, Herbst et al., 2018; 29169877) or necitumumab (Paz_Ares et al., 2016; 27207107). Although meta_analyses demonstrate that increased EGFR copy number is significantly associated with improved ORR, PFS, and OS on first_generation EGFR TKIs (Zhang et al., 2016; 27664271, Dahabreh et al., 2011; 20826716, Dahabreh et al., 2010; 20028749, Carlson et al., 2009; 19430813), the magnitude of clinical benefit is limited for patients with EGFR amplification and without sensitizing EGFR mutations when comparing first_or second generation EGFR TKIs to control treatment (Fukuoka et al., 2011; 21670455, Cappuzzo et al., 2015; 25514804, Greve et al., 2015; 25682316, 25514804, Crino et al., 2008; 18779612, Kim et al., 2008; 19027483, Soh et al., 2007; 17487844). In the Phase 3 IPASS trial, patients with unmutated, amplified EGFR had a significantly shorter PFS when treated with gefitinib as compared to carboplatin/paclitaxel (HR 3.85; 95% CI, 2.09 to 7.09) (Fukuoka et al., 2011; 21670455). Biomarker analysis of the LUX_Lung 8 trial in squamous NSCLC, which included only a small subset of patients with EGFR mutations (6%), did not observe a significant association of EGFR expression with outcomes on afatinib or erlotinib (Goss et al., 2018; 29902295). A retrospective study in China reported that EGFR amplification was associated with a significantly improved median PFS (5.0 vs 2.0 months) and a similar median OS (16.6. vs. 15.4 months) for patients with unmutated EGFR treated with gefitinib or erlotinib (Wang et al., 2013; 23557218). The Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study of amivantamab monotherapy or in combination with lazertinib for the treatment of EGFR_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has produced encouraging preliminary results for treatment_naive patients and patients who relapsed after treatment with osimertinib with and without chemotherapy, including osimertinib_relapsed patients with biomarkers indicating EGFR/MET_based osimertinib resistance (Leighl et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 1192MO, Cho et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 1258O, Bauml et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9006, Shu et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 1193MO). In a Phase 1 trial, the HER3_targeted antibody patritumab deruxtecan elicited an ORR of 39% (22/57, 1 CR) and a median PFS of 8.2 months for patients with non_small cell lung cancer previously treated with an EGFR TKI, many of whom displayed TKI resistance alterations (Janne et al., 2022; 34548309). A Phase 1 trial evaluating the EGFR inhibitor AZD3759 reported a reduction in the volume of brain metastases in 40% (8/20) of patients with previously treated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring either the EGFR L858R alteration or EGFR exon 19 deletion, including 3 confirmed PRs and 3 unconfirmed PRs (Ahn et al., 2017; 29056570, Yang et al., 2016; 27928026). In a Phase 1/2 trial for advanced NSCLC, the brain_penetrant third_generation EGFR TKI lazertinib enabled ORRs of 54% (69/127) for all evaluable patients and 44% (8/18, intracranial) for patients with brain metastases (Ahn et al., 2019; 31587882). A Phase 1 trial evaluating the irreversible pan_HER inhibitor FCN_411 for NSCLC patients who had EGFR mutations and experienced disease progression on standard treatments reported an ORR of 15% with 10/67 patients achieving PR, and a DCR of 73% with 39 additional patients achieving SD (Lin et al., 2022; 35248866). OR was observed in a numerically higher proportion of patients with the EGFR T790M mutation than those without this mutation (Lin et al., 2022; 35248866). The Phase 3 AENEAS trial of first_line aumolertinib, a third_generation EGFR TKI, for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring either the EGFR L858R alteration or EGFR exon 19 deletion reported significantly improved mPFS (19.3 months vs. 9.9 months) and similar ORR (74% vs. 72%) and DCR (93% vs. 97%) compared with gefitinib (Lu et al., 2022; 35580297). Patients with EGFR_mutated non_squamous metastatic non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who progressed on EGFR TKI have benefited from immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with antiangiogenic therapy and chemotherapy, particularly atezolizumab plus bevacizumab plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (OS HR=0.61 compared with bevacizumab/chemotherapy) (Reck et al., 2019; 30922878, Socinski et al., 2021; 34311108, Socinski et al., 2018; 29863955) or sintilimab plus bevacizumab biosimilar IBI305 plus cisplatin and pemetrexed (PFS HR=0.46 compared with chemotherapy alone) (Lu et al., 2022; 35908558).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

A Phase 2 study of 31 patients with NSCLC found that the addition of cetuximab to radiotherapy and chemotherapy produced an ORR of 67%; EGFR gene copy number was not predictive of efficacy outcome in this trial (Ramalingam et al., 2013; 23849982). A Phase 3 study of 938 patients with progressive NSCLC after platinum_based therapy concluded that the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy was not recommended in this second_line setting (Kim et al., 2013; 24231627). Cetuximab is also being studied as part of a therapeutic regimen for patients with NSCLC with EGFR mutations who develop secondary resistance to erlotinib or gefitinib. A Phase 1b study combining afatinib and cetuximab for patients with either T790M_positive or T790M_negative tumors observed an overall ORR of 29%, and comparable response rates in both groups (32% T790M_positive vs. 25% T790M_negative) (Janjigian et al., 2014; 25074459). A Phase 1 study evaluating the combination erlotinib and cetuximab treatment for patients with NSCLC, including squamous tumors, regardless of EGFR status, as well as those who had progressed on prior erlotinib treatment, reported PRs in 10% (2/20) of patients and SDs lasting at least 6 months in 15% (3/20) of patients (Wheler et al., 2013; 23963360); in addition, a retrospective analysis of this trial identified a patient with an exon 19 deletion and T790M who progressed rapidly on cetuximab and erlotinib (Tsigelny et al., 2015; 25760241). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Gefitinib", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Gefitinib targets the tyrosine kinase EGFR and is FDA approved to treat non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations in EGFR.

Clinical studies have consistently shown significant improvement in response rates and PFS for patients with EGFR_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with gefitinib compared with chemotherapy (Han et al., 2012; 22370314, Maemondo et al., 2010; 20573926, Mitsudomi et al., 2010; 20022809, Mok et al., 2009; 19692680, Petrelli et al., 2011; 22056888, Qi et al., 2015; 25329826, Zhao et al., 2015; 25546556), and responses have been reported for patients with EGFR_rearranged NSCLC (Wang et al., 2018; 30255937, Baik et al., 2015; 26398831). For patients with esophageal or biliary cancer treated with erlotinib or gefitinib, elevated EGFR copy number or amplification is associated with clinical responses and longer survival (Petty et al., 2017; 28537764, Philip et al., 2006; 16809731, Xie et al., 2020; 32958820, Luo et al., 2020; 33026449, Lee et al., 2012; 22192731). Patients with refractory advanced esophageal carcinoma and EGFR amplification derived significant overall survival benefit from gefitinib compared to placebo (HR = 0.21)(Petty et al., 2017; 28537764, Dutton et al., 2014; 24950987). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> Gefitinib achieved an ORR of 69.8% and OS of 19.2 months as first_line treatment for Caucasian patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and EGFR sensitizing mutations (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064). Phase 3 studies for Japanese patients (Mitsudomi et al., 2010; 20022809, Yoshioka et al., 2019; 31553438) and East Asian patients (Fukuoka et al., 2011; 21670455, Mok et al., 2009; 19692680) with EGFR_mutated NSCLC reported longer PFS but not longer OS on first_line gefitinib compared with cisplatin and docetaxel or carboplatin and paclitaxel. Retrospective analysis of East Asian patients receiving first_line gefitinib reported greatest PFS benefit among patients with EGFR exon 19 insertions or deletions and shortest PFS for those with exon 20 insertions (1.2 months)(Sutiman et al., 2017; 27908825). Two Phase 3 trials of the combination gefitinib plus pemetrexed and carboplatin compared with gefitinib alone for patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR activating mutations reported significantly higher ORRs (75.3% and 84% vs. 62.5% and 67%), longer median PFS (16 and 20.9 months vs. 8 and 11.9 months), and longer median OS (50.9 months and not reached vs. 17 and 38.8 months) with combination treatment; however, combination treatment was associated with increased Grade 3 or higher adverse events (Noronha et al., 2019; 31411950, Hosomi et al., 2020; 31682542). In a Phase 1 study for treatment_naive patients with NSCLC, 63% (19/30) of patients experienced PR from the combination of gefitinib and the PD_L1 inhibitor durvalumab (Creelan et al., 2021; 33012782). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Panitumumab", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Panitumumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets EGFR.

In the first_line setting for patients who are EGFR TKI naive with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring common EGFR mutations (exon 19 or L858R alterations), afatinib has shown improved clinical benefit and responses as compared with chemotherapy in the Phase 3 LUX_Lung 3 and LUX_Lung 6 trials (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960, Wu et al., 2014; 24439929) and to gefitinib in the Phase 2b LUX_Lung 7 trial (Park et al., 2016; 27083334, Paz_Ares et al., 2017; 28426106); these outcomes are supported in additional prospective or randomized Phase 2 trials (Popat et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.13_17, Suzuki et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_92). Alteration_specific differences in OS response have also been reported in patients who are treatment naive, with increased OS observed in patients with EGFR exon 19 alterations between afatinib and comparator arms versus no significant OS differences for patients with L858R mutations in the same treatment settings (Yang et al., 2015; 25589191, Lau et al., 2019; 31178389). In the second_line setting, patients with metastatic NSCLC and common EGFR mutations who progressed on prior chemotherapy experienced an ORR of 50% (30/60) from afatinib in a Phase 4 trial (Thongprasert et al., 2019; 31807143). A retrospective study of afatinib administered to Asian patients with NSCLC, 99% of whom were previously treated with erlotinib and/or gefitinib, reported an ORR of 27% for patients with common sensitizing EGFR mutations and an ORR of 24% for the entire cohort (Chang et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_11). In a case report, a patient with NSCLC with exon 19 deletion and leptomeningeal metastases experienced an ongoing 16_month PR from afatinib in extracranial, brain, and leptomeningeal lesions (Llinas_Quintero et al., 2019; 31637072). For patients with erlotinib_ or gefitinib_resistant NSCLC and EGFR mutations, Phase 2/3 studies of afatinib treatment have generally reported ORRs of only 7 to 9% (Miller et al., 2012; 22452896, Chen et al., 2013; 23664448, Katakami et al., 2013; 23816963, Landi et al., 2014; 25242668, De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2015; 25682316, Yang et al., 2015; 26051236); however, DCRs of more than 50% have been observed (De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2015; 25682316). In a Phase 1b or observational study, patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC who progressed on afatinib experienced further clinical benefit from subsequent treatment with afatinib and cetuximab (Horn et al., 2017; 29110849) or osimertinib (Yamamoto et al., 2020; 31863283), respectively. In the LUX_Lung 1 Phase 2b/3 trial for patients with advanced non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who previously progressed on first_generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, afatinib treatment resulted in longer median PFS (mPFS; 3.3 vs. 1.1 months, HR=0.38) but no significant difference in median OS (mOS; 10.8 vs. 12.0 months, HR=1.08) when compared with placebo (Miller et al., 2012; 22452896); similar results were observed in the single_arm LUX_Lung 4 trial in the same treatment setting (Katakami et al., 2013; 23816963). The randomized Phase 3 LUX_Lung 8 trial comparing afatinib with erlotinib as second_line therapy for advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) reported significantly longer mOS (7.9 vs. 6.8 months, HR=0.81), significantly longer mPFS (2.6 vs. 1.9 months, HR=0.81), and higher DCR (51% vs. 40%, p=0.002) for patients treated with afatinib (Soria et al., 2015; 26156651). For patients who progressed on afatinib monotherapy, additional clinical benefit has been reported from afatinib combined with paclitaxel (Schuler et al., 2016; 26646759). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Osimertinib", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Osimertinib is an irreversible EGFR TKI that is selective for EGFR TKI_sensitizing mutations and the EGFR T790M mutation.

This study and meta_analyses attribute the lack of OS benefit to the effectiveness of post_progression salvage therapy in the control arm (Lee et al., 2017; 28376144). A Phase 3 study reported similar efficacy of erlotinib and gefitinib for patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC (Yang et al., 2017; 28103612). Patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC have experienced PFS benefit with the addition of bevacizumab to erlotinib in the first_line setting in Phase 3 trials including the ARTEMIS_CTONG1509 trial for Chinese patients (17.9 vs. 11.2 months, HR=0.55)(Zhou et al., 2021; 34388377), the NEJ026 trial for Japanese patients (16.9 vs. 13.3 months, HR=0.605)(Kawashima et al., 2022; 34454653, Saito et al., 2019; 30975627), and the international BEVERLY trial (15.4 vs. 9.7 months, HR=0.60)(Piccirillo et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 12070); OS benefit has not been observed across these studies.

In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). Amplification of EGFR has been associated with increased expression of EGFR mRNA and protein in several cancer types (Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Bhargava et al., 2005; 15920544, Yang et al., 2012; 22490401). EGFR L858 is located in the kinase domain and is encoded by exon 21. EGFR L858R has been characterized as activating (Lynch et al., 2004; 15118073, Paez et al., 2004; 15118125, Pao et al., 2004; 15329413) and patients with the L858R mutation have been shown to be sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as erlotinib, gefitinib (Lynch et al., 2004; 15118073, Paez et al., 2004; 15118125, Pao et al., 2004; 15329413), and afatinib (Yang et al., 2015; 25589191). EGFR mutation has been reported in 12_36% of lung adenocarcinomas (Vallee et al., 2013; 23934203, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552) and in 4% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745). Amplification of EGFR has been variously reported in 4_42% of non_small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) samples (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745, Park et al., 2012; 22207554, Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Grob et al., 2013; 23238037). EGFR protein expression/overexpression has been reported in up to 70% of NSCLC cases (Watzka et al., 2010; 20353893, Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Grob et al., 2013; 23238037, Park et al., 2012; 22207554, Dobashi et al., 2011; 21040950, Ludovini et al., 2013; 23314677). In addition, expression of EGFR protein has been shown to be higher in lung squamous cell carcinoma samples as compared to lung adenocarcinoma (Skrzypski et al., 2013; 23870818, Kim et al., 2012; 22419022). In patients with lung adenocarcinoma, EGFR gene amplification was a predictor of poor disease_free survival (Lee et al., 2013; 23525704). In patients with lung adenocarcinoma, EGFR mutation was a predictor of poor overall survival (Lee et al., 2013; 23525704, Oakley and Chiosea, 2011; 21587084). However, EGFR mutations have been reported to predict improved survival in patients with resected Stage 1_3 lung adenocarcinoma (Marks et al., 2008; 18303429) or resected Stage 1 NSCLC (Izar et al., 2013; 23932319). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EGFR activating mutations may predict sensitivity to EGFR\u2013TKIs, including erlotinib (Rosell et al., 2011; 22285168), gefitinib (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064, Hayashi et al., 2020; 32673682, Cao et al., 2018; 29780256, Yang et al., 2011; 21422421), afatinib (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960, Bao_Dong Qin et al., 2018; 30127622, Frega et al., 2016; 27131295, Long et al., 2020; 33116645), dacomitinib (Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), and osimertinib (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549, Bao_Dong Qin et al., 2018; 30127622); however, the data for patients with other tumor types are limited (Hong et al., 2020; 32749686, Kim et al., 2015; 26462025, Kim et al., 2015; 25424851, Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840, Cavalieri et al., 2018; 29734047, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Audet et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 6041). EGFR amplification or expression in patients with non_small cell lung cancer may be associated with benefit from the anti_EGFR antibodies cetuximab (Pirker et al., 2011; 22056021, Herbst et al., 2018; 29169877) or necitumumab (Paz_Ares et al., 2016; 27207107). Although meta_analyses demonstrate that increased EGFR copy number is significantly associated with improved ORR, PFS, and OS on first_generation EGFR TKIs (Zhang et al., 2016; 27664271, Dahabreh et al., 2011; 20826716, Dahabreh et al., 2010; 20028749, Carlson et al., 2009; 19430813), the magnitude of clinical benefit is limited for patients with EGFR amplification and without sensitizing EGFR mutations when comparing first_or second generation EGFR TKIs to control treatment (Fukuoka et al., 2011; 21670455, Cappuzzo et al., 2015; 25514804, Greve et al., 2015; 25682316, 25514804, Crino et al., 2008; 18779612, Kim et al., 2008; 19027483, Soh et al., 2007; 17487844). In the Phase 3 IPASS trial, patients with unmutated, amplified EGFR had a significantly shorter PFS when treated with gefitinib as compared to carboplatin/paclitaxel (HR 3.85; 95% CI, 2.09 to 7.09) (Fukuoka et al., 2011; 21670455). Biomarker analysis of the LUX_Lung 8 trial in squamous NSCLC, which included only a small subset of patients with EGFR mutations (6%), did not observe a significant association of EGFR expression with outcomes on afatinib or erlotinib (Goss et al., 2018; 29902295). A retrospective study in China reported that EGFR amplification was associated with a significantly improved median PFS (5.0 vs 2.0 months) and a similar median OS (16.6. vs. 15.4 months) for patients with unmutated EGFR treated with gefitinib or erlotinib (Wang et al., 2013; 23557218). The Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study of amivantamab monotherapy or in combination with lazertinib for the treatment of EGFR_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has produced encouraging preliminary results for treatment_naive patients and patients who relapsed after treatment with osimertinib with and without chemotherapy, including osimertinib_relapsed patients with biomarkers indicating EGFR/MET_based osimertinib resistance (Leighl et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 1192MO, Cho et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 1258O, Bauml et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9006, Shu et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 1193MO). In a Phase 1 trial, the HER3_targeted antibody patritumab deruxtecan elicited an ORR of 39% (22/57, 1 CR) and a median PFS of 8.2 months for patients with non_small cell lung cancer previously treated with an EGFR TKI, many of whom displayed TKI resistance alterations (Janne et al., 2022; 34548309). A Phase 1 trial evaluating the EGFR inhibitor AZD3759 reported a reduction in the volume of brain metastases in 40% (8/20) of patients with previously treated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring either the EGFR L858R alteration or EGFR exon 19 deletion, including 3 confirmed PRs and 3 unconfirmed PRs (Ahn et al., 2017; 29056570, Yang et al., 2016; 27928026). In a Phase 1/2 trial for advanced NSCLC, the brain_penetrant third_generation EGFR TKI lazertinib enabled ORRs of 54% (69/127) for all evaluable patients and 44% (8/18, intracranial) for patients with brain metastases (Ahn et al., 2019; 31587882). A Phase 1 trial evaluating the irreversible pan_HER inhibitor FCN_411 for NSCLC patients who had EGFR mutations and experienced disease progression on standard treatments reported an ORR of 15% with 10/67 patients achieving PR, and a DCR of 73% with 39 additional patients achieving SD (Lin et al., 2022; 35248866). OR was observed in a numerically higher proportion of patients with the EGFR T790M mutation than those without this mutation (Lin et al., 2022; 35248866). The Phase 3 AENEAS trial of first_line aumolertinib, a third_generation EGFR TKI, for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring either the EGFR L858R alteration or EGFR exon 19 deletion reported significantly improved mPFS (19.3 months vs. 9.9 months) and similar ORR (74% vs. 72%) and DCR (93% vs. 97%) compared with gefitinib (Lu et al., 2022; 35580297). Patients with EGFR_mutated non_squamous metastatic non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who progressed on EGFR TKI have benefited from immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with antiangiogenic therapy and chemotherapy, particularly atezolizumab plus bevacizumab plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (OS HR=0.61 compared with bevacizumab/chemotherapy) (Reck et al., 2019; 30922878, Socinski et al., 2021; 34311108, Socinski et al., 2018; 29863955) or sintilimab plus bevacizumab biosimilar IBI305 plus cisplatin and pemetrexed (PFS HR=0.46 compared with chemotherapy alone) (Lu et al., 2022; 35908558).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

A Phase 2 study of 31 patients with NSCLC found that the addition of cetuximab to radiotherapy and chemotherapy produced an ORR of 67%; EGFR gene copy number was not predictive of efficacy outcome in this trial (Ramalingam et al., 2013; 23849982). A Phase 3 study of 938 patients with progressive NSCLC after platinum_based therapy concluded that the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy was not recommended in this second_line setting (Kim et al., 2013; 24231627). Cetuximab is also being studied as part of a therapeutic regimen for patients with NSCLC with EGFR mutations who develop secondary resistance to erlotinib or gefitinib.

A Phase 1 study evaluating the combination erlotinib and cetuximab treatment for patients with NSCLC, including squamous tumors, regardless of EGFR status, as well as those who had progressed on prior erlotinib treatment, reported PRs in 10% (2/20) of patients and SDs lasting at least 6 months in 15% (3/20) of patients (Wheler et al., 2013; 23963360); in addition, a retrospective analysis of this trial identified a patient with an exon 19 deletion and T790M who progressed rapidly on cetuximab and erlotinib (Tsigelny et al., 2015; 25760241). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Gefitinib", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Gefitinib targets the tyrosine kinase EGFR and is FDA approved to treat non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations in EGFR.

MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI_H is generally infrequent in NSCLC, reported in fewer than 1% of samples across several large studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197, Ninomiya et al., 2006; 16641899, Vanderwalde et al., 2018; 29436178, Zang et al., 2019; 31270941, Dudley et al., 2016; 26880610, Takamochi et al., 2017; 28676214, Schrock et al., 2017; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2016.11.487), whereas data on the reported incidence of MSI_H in SCLC has been limited and conflicting (Pylkkanen et al., 1997; 9329646, Gonzalez et al., 2000; 11061602, Chen et al., 1996; 8782463, Merlo et al., 1994; 8174113). One study reported MSI_H in lung adenocarcinoma patients with smoking history, and 3 of 4 MSI_H patients examined also had metachronous carcinomas in other organs, although this has not been investigated in large scale studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of MSI in NSCLC are limited (PubMed, Oct 2022). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "NKX2_1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "NKX2_1 (also known as NK2 homeobox 1) encodes the thyroid transcription factor TTF_1 (Hamdan et al., 1998; 9545595). Amplification of NKX2_1 results in overexpression of TTF_1 (Kwei et al., 2008; 18212743). TTF_1 has been observed to have tumor_promoting as well as anti_oncogenic roles (Yamaguchi et al., 2013; 23763999, Mu et al., 2013; 23818522). Amplification of NKX2_1 has been reported with the highest incidence in lung adenocarcinoma (14%) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014; 25079552) and less frequently in lung squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) (5%) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2012; 22960745). NKX2_1 amplification has also been observed in other solid tumors, including prostate adenocarcinomas (6%) (Kumar et al., 2016; 26928463, Abida et al., 2019; 31061129) and thyroid cancers (6%) (Landa et al., 2016; 26878173, Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359). NKX2_1 mutations have been infrequently reported in solid (Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359) or hematological malignancies (Tyner et al., 2018; 30333627, Chapuy et al., 2018; 29713087, Zhang et al., 2016; 27776115, Landau et al., 2015; 26466571). Increased expression of NKX2_1 has been associated with favorable prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma, though this finding is not always significant (Tsai et al., 2014; 23995788, Yang et al., 2012; 23125078, Hsu et al., 2009; 19279207, Tan et al., 2003; 12827614, Haque et al., 2002; 12051626, Pelosi et al., 2001; 11224607, Au et al., 2004; 15307143, Moises et al., 2017; 29237428). Increased expression has been associated with a prolonged OS in gastric cancer (Zhao et al., 2014; 25478793). Cytoplasmic TTF_1 expression has been reported as an adverse prognostic factor in breast carcinoma (Robens et al., 2010; 21107096, Ni et al., 2014; 24111789). There are no approved therapies or trials that target tumors with TTF_1 amplification or overexpression.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "S241T", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "S241T"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 is one of the most commonly mutated genes in lung cancer; mutations have been reported in 43_80% of non_small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745, Mogi and Kuwano, 2011; 21331359, Tekpli et al., 2013; 23011884, Vignot et al., 2013; 23630207, Maeng et al., 2013; 24222160, Cortot et al., 2014; 24169260, Itakura et al., 2013; 23922113), including 42_52% of lung adenocarcinomas and 58_83% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (cBioPortal, COSMIC, Feb 2022)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552, cBio_Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745, Kim et al., 2014; 24323028). TP53 homozygous deletion has been observed in 1.4% of lung adenocarcinoma and <1% of lung squamous cell carcinoma cases (cBioPortal, Feb 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). In one study of 55 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, TP53 alterations correlated with immunogenic features including PD_L1 expression, tumor mutation burden and neoantigen presentation; likely as a consequence of this association TP53 mutations correlated with improved clinical outcomes to PD_1 inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab in this study (Dong et al., 2016; 28039262). Mutations in TP53 have been associated with lymph node metastasis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (Seo et al., 2012; 22975805). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "02", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "02"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen.

This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Spigel et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9017, Hellmann et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT077, Ramalingam et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT078, Kowanetz et al., 2016; ESMO Abstract 77P, Gandara et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 12950, Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Velcheti et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12001, Herbst et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA79, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT07, Castellanos et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 2630, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Colli et al., 2016; 27197178, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Wang et al., 2017; 28923100, Carbone et al., 2017; 28636851, Rizvi et al., 2018; 29337640, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Forde et al., 2018; 29658848, Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Miao et al., 2018; 30150660, Chae et al., 2019; 30425022, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526). A large_scale genomic analysis found that unspecified lung non_small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), lung adenocarcinoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) samples harbored median TMBs between 6.3 and 9 Muts/Mb, and 12% to 17% of cases had an elevated TMB of greater than 20 Muts/Mb (FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). Lower TMB is observed more commonly in NSCLCs harboring known driver mutations (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, or MET) with the exception of BRAF or KRAS mutations, which are commonly observed in elevated TMB cases (Spigel et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9017). Although some studies have reported a lack of association between smoking and mutational burden in NSCLC (Schwartz et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 8533, Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843, Shim et al., 2015; 26200269), several other large studies did find a strong association with increased TMB (Govindan et al., 2012; 22980976, Ding et al., 2008; 18948947, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Kim et al., 2014; 24323028). TMB >10 muts/Mb was found to be more frequent in NSCLC metastases compared with primary tumors for both adenocarcinoma (38% vs. 25%) and SCC (41% vs. 35%) subtypes (Stein et al., 2019; DOI: 10.1200/PO.18.00376). A meta_analysis of 19 studies of immune checkpoint inhibitor_treated NSCLC (n = 2,315 patients) demonstrated that high TMB predicted a significantly longer OS than low TMB (HR = 0.70), and within the high TMB group, immunotherapy was associated with an improved PFS (HR = 0.62, P<0.001), OS (HR = 0.67, P<0.001) and a higher response rate (OR = 2.35, P<0.001) compared to chemotherapy (Meng et al., 2022; 35113949). In contrast, a large study of Chinese patients with untreated lung adenocarcinoma reported a shorter median OS for tumors with a higher number of mutations in a limited gene set compared with a lower mutation number (48.4 vs. 61.0 months)(Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843). Another study of patients with NSCLC treated with EGFR inhibitors or platinum doublet chemotherapy found elevated TMB to be correlated with poorer prognosis, as well as finding lower TMB in combination with PD_L1 negative status to be significantly associated with longer median survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). However, no significant prognostic association of TMB and/or PD_L1 status with survival has been reported in patients with lung SCC (Yu et al., 2019; 30253973, Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). Multiple clinical trials of PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors or combination of PD_1 and CTLA_4 inhibitors in NSCLC have reported that patients with tumors harboring TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb derive greater clinical benefit from these therapies than those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb (based on this assay or others); similarly, higher efficacy of anti_PD_1 or anti_PD_L1 immunotherapy for treatment of patients with NSCLC, compared with the use of chemotherapy, has been observed more significantly in cases of TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (based on this assay or others); (Spigel et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9017, Hellmann et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT077, Ramalingam et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT078, Kowanetz et al., 2016; ESMO Abstract 77P, Gandara et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 12950, Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Velcheti et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12001, Herbst et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA79, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT07, Castellanos et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 2630, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Colli et al., 2016; 27197178, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Wang et al., 2017; 28923100, Carbone et al., 2017; 28636851, Rizvi et al., 2018; 29337640, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Forde et al., 2018; 29658848, Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Miao et al., 2018; 30150660, Chae et al., 2019; 30425022). Improved OS of patients with NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy relative to chemotherapy only (Paz_Ares et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA80), or those treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab also relative to chemotherapy (Hellmann et al., 2019; 31562796), has been observed across all TMB levels.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "EGFR", "Alteration": "amplificationL858R", "Title": "HERTHENA_Lung02: A Study of Patritumab Deruxtecan Versus Platinum_based Chemotherapy in Metastatic or Locally Advanced EGFRm NSCLC After Failure of EGFR TKI Therapy", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 3", "Target": "ERBB3", "Locations": "Taipei (Taiwan), Taoyuan (Taiwan), Tainan (Taiwan), Kumamoto (Japan), Kurume (Japan), Fukuoka (Japan), Goyang (Korea, Republic of), Cheongju_si (Korea, Republic of), Iwakuni (Japan), Matsuyama (Japan)", "NCTID": "NCT05338970", "Note": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.
