This sample harbors a bTMB level that may be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Average bTMB levels in solid tumors other than NSCLC have not been evaluated (PubMed, Mar 2022). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of bTMB levels in biliary tract cancer are limited (PubMed, Jul 2022). Although cases with hypermutated biliary tract cancer were enriched in a subgroup with poor prognosis in 1 study (Nakamura et al., 2015; 26258846), TMB_high (\u226510 mut/Mb) status in biliary adenocarcinoma not treated with immunotherapy was not significantly associated with OS in another study, in which patients with TMB_high tumors experienced numerically longer OS compared with patients with TMB_low tumors (11.5 vs. 8.4 months, adjusted HR=0.65) (Shao et al., 2020; 33119110). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB) may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716), anti_PD_1 (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716), and anti_PD_1/CTLA4 therapies (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P). A Phase 2 multi_solid_tumor trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022). In non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single_agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 Muts/Mb_16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Increased tumor mutational burden may predict response to anti_PD_1 (alone or in combination with anti_CTLA_4) or anti_PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Pembrolizumab", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD_1 receptor and blocks its interaction with the ligands PD_L1 and PD_L2 to enhance antitumor immune responses.

It also has a direct role in initiation of replication and the maintenance of genomic stability (M\u00f6r\u00f6y and Geisen, 2004; 15147722). Amplification of chromosomal region 19q12_q13 has been demonstrated in many types of cancer, and CCNE1 is a well_studied gene within this amplicon (Leung et al., 2006; 16575401, Lin et al., 2000; 11156406). Increased copy number of CCNE1 is highly associated with overexpression of the cyclin E1 protein (Mayr et al., 2006; 16753589, Nakayama et al., 2010; 20336784). Cyclin E1 overexpression can lead to cell transformation as a result of an increase in cyclin E1 activity (Stamatakos et al., 2010; 21176227, M\u00f6r\u00f6y and Geisen, 2004; 15147722). CCNE1 amplification has been reported in 1_2% of samples in published cholangiocarcinoma datasets (cBio_Lowery et al., 2018; 29848569, cBio_Sanchez_Vega et al., 2018; 29625050). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of CCNE1 alterations in biliary tract carcinoma are limited (PubMed, Mar 2022). There are no approved therapies that directly target CCNE1 alterations. Because amplification or overexpression of CCNE1 leads to increased genomic instability though the ATR_CHK1_WEE1 pathway (Lin et al., 2017; 28331049, Chen et al., 2018; 30181387) and cyclin E1 promotes cell cycle progression in a complex with CDK2 (M\u00f6r\u00f6y and Geisen, 2004; 15147722), clinical and preclinical studies have investigated inhibitors of CHK1, ATR, CDK2, and WEE1 as potential therapeutic approaches for tumors with CCNE1 activation. Clinical benefit has been reported for patients with recurrent high_grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) with CCNE1 amplification or expression in response to treatment with the CHK1 inhibitor prexasertib (Lee et al., 2018; 29361470). Studies of the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib observed PRs in patients with CCNE1_amplified HGSOC and ovarian cancer (Lheureux et al., 2021; 33485453, Oza et al., 2020; 32611648). Similarly, in a Phase 2 study of patients with CCNE1_amplified solid tumors, adavosertib elicited an ORR of 26% with PRs reported for patients with ovarian cancer, urothelial carcinoma, or melanoma (Fu et al., 2021; AACR abstract 974). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that cell lines with CCNE1 amplification or overexpression were sensitive to inhibitors of ATR (Toledo et al., 2011; 21552262, Buisson et al., 2015; 26365377), CDK2 (Yang et al., 2015; 26204491), or WEE1 (Kok et al., 2020; 33028815, Chen et al., 2018; 30181387). However, other studies have shown that sensitivity of various cell lines to CDK2 inhibitors, including SNS_032, dinaciclib, and seliciclib, at clinically achievable doses, is largely independent of CCNE1 copy number or expression (Taylor_Harding et al., 2015; 25557169, Etemadmoghadam et al., 2013; 24004674, Scaltriti et al., 2011; 21321214, Nanos_Webb et al., 2012; 21695458).

Amplification of FGFR1 has been correlated with protein expression (Kohler et al., 2012; 22648708, Kim et al., 2013; 23182986) and may predict pathway activation and sensitivity to therapies targeting this pathway (Andr\u00e9 et al., 2014; 24508104, Dienstmann et al., 2014; 24265351). Although FGFR1 amplification and mutation have been reported infrequently in biliary tract tumors and cholangiocarcinoma (cBio_Chan_On et al., 2013; 24185513, cBio_Ong et al., 2012; 22561520, cBio_Jiao et al., 2013; 24185509, Ross et al., 2014; 24563076, Nakamura et al., 2015; 26258846, Lee et al., 2015; 26500333), recurrent activating FGFR2 fusions have been reported in 8_50% of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (Javle et al., 2016; 27622582, Ross et al., 2014; 24563076, Borad et al., 2014; 24550739, Arai et al., 2013; 24122810, Sia et al., 2015; 25608663, cBio_Jiao et al., 2013; 24185509, Nakamura et al., 2015; 26258846). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of FGFR1 alterations in biliary tract carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma are limited (PubMed, Aug 2021). Alterations that activate FGFR1 may predict sensitivity to selective FGFR inhibitors including erdafitinib (Loriot et al., 2019; 31340094, Tabernero et al., 2015; 26324363, Karkera et al., 2017; 28416604, Park et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 4117), pemigatinib (Necchi et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 900P), infigratinib (Pal et al., 2018; 29848605, Pal et al., 2020; 32208524), futibatinib (Bahleda et al., 2020; 32622884, Meric_Bernstam et al., 2022; 34551969, Kasbekar et al., 2020; 32649766), rogaratinib (Schuler et al., 2019; 31405822), Debio 1347 (Sait et al., 2021; 34250399, Voss et al., 2019; 30745300), and derazantinib (Papadopoulos et al., 2017; 28972963), or multikinase inhibitors such as pazopanib (Cheng et al., 2017; 29223982, Yuan et al., 2016; SABCS Abstract P6_16_08) and ponatinib (Khodaoust et al., 2015; 26055304, Tanasi et al., 2019; 31434701, Strati et al., 2018; 29119847, Kreil et al., 2015; Abstract 2812). The activity and efficacy of selective FGFR inhibitors for FGFR1_amplified tumors has been modest with limited responses reported in FGFR1_amplified lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) treated with infigratinib (Nogova et al., 2017; 27870574) or AZD457 (Aggarwal et al., 2019; 31195180) and no responses reported among patients with FGFR1_amplified breast cancer treated with infigratinib (Nogova et al., 2017; 27870574). Two case studies reported PRs in patients with FGFR1_amplified breast cancer treated with pazopanib (Cheng et al., 2017; 29223982, Yuan et al., 2016; SABCS Abstract P6_16_08).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "FGFR inhibitors may be relevant in tumors with alterations that activate FGFR1.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT05024214", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05254847", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05156788", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05010668", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04169672", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05010681", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05098847", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04550624", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05215665", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04976634", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "MDM2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "MDM2 encodes an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p53, Rb1, and other proteins (Sdek et al., 2005; 16337594, Brady et al., 2005; 15632057, Li et al., 2004; 15053880). MDM2 acts to prevent the activity of the tumor suppressor p53; therefore, overexpression or amplification of MDM2 may be oncogenic (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675, Cordon_Cardo et al., 1994; 8306343). Overexpression or amplification of MDM2 is frequent in cancer (Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). Although two retrospective clinical studies suggest that MDM2 amplification may predict a short time_to_treatment failure on anti_PD_1/PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors, with 4/5 patients with MDM2 amplification (Kato et al., 2017; 28351930) and 2/3 patients with MDM2 or MDM4 amplification (Singavi et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 1140PD) experiencing tumor hyperprogression, amplification of MDM2 or MDM4 was not associated with shorter progression_free survival (PFS) in a retrospective analysis of non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) outcomes with immune checkpoint inhibitors (hazard ratio of 1.4, p=0.44)(Rizvi et al., 2018; 29337640). The latter study reported PFS of >2 months for 5/8 patients with MDM2/MDM4 amplification (Rizvi et al., 2018; 29337640). MDM2 amplification has been observed in 10.8% of gallbladder carcinoma and 3.2% of cholangiocarcinoma samples (cBio_Narayan et al., 2019; 30427539, cBio_Lowery et al., 2018; 29848569, cBio_Boerner et al., 2021; 33765338). MDM2 overexpression has been reported to be a common event in biliary tract cancers, occurring in 75% of gallbladder adenocarcinoma and in 38_68% of ICC cases, respectively (Momoi et al., 2001; 11580146, Horie et al., 2000; 10963376, Jarnagin et al., 2006; 16505435, Della et al., 2000; 10718212). MDM2 overexpression in pancreatic carcinomas and biliary tract tumors has been associated with advanced tumor stage, metastasis, and poor patient prognosis (Grochola et al., 2011; 21404460, Horie et al., 2000; 10963376, Jarnagin et al., 2006; 16505435). MDM2 antagonists disrupt the MDM2_p53 interaction, thereby stabilizing p53 (Cheok et al., 2011; 20975744). Preclinical studies have suggested that the amplification of MDM2, in the absence of concurrent TP53 mutations, may increase sensitivity to these agents (Ohnstad et al., 2013; 23165797, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357). Preliminary Phase 1 studies of the MDM2_p53 antagonist alrizomadlin (APG_115) reported a PR in a patient with liposarcoma harboring an MDM2 amplification and wildtype for TP53 and SD in 21%\u201338% (6/28 and 5/13, respectively) of patients in genomically unselected solid tumors (Zhang et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3124, Rasco et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3126). A Phase 2 trial of alrizomadlin in combination with pembrolizumab reported a PR in 1 of 3 patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor that had failed standard therapy, as well as PRs in patients with multiple types of solid tumors that had failed immunotherapy, including 1 out of 14 patients with non_small cell lung cancer; 1 out of 5 patients with urothelial carcinoma; and 2 out of5, 1 out of 5, and 1 out of 11 patients with mucosal, uveal, and cutaneous melanoma, respectively (Tolcher et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 2506). Phase 1b studies of the MDM2 inhibitor idasanutlin for refractory AML in combination with cytarabine or venetoclax reported anti_leukemic response rates of 33% (25/75) and 37% (11/30), respectively (Martinelli et al., 2016; EHA21 Abstract S504, Daver et al., 2018; ASH Abstract 767); clinical benefit (58% ORR, 7/12) with idasanutlin monotherapy has been reported for patients with polycythemia vera (Mascarenhas et al., 2019; ASH Abstract 134). The dual MDM2/MDM4 inhibitor ALRN_6924 led to an ORR of 27% (4/15) for patients with TP53 wildtype peripheral T_cell lymphoma in a Phase 2 study (Shustov et al., 2018; ASH Abstract 1623); responses have also been observed in TP53 wildtype AML, MDS, Merkel cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and liposarcoma (Sallman et al., 2018; ASH Abstract 4066, Meric_Bernstam et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 2505).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Inhibitors of the MDM2_p53 interaction are being tested in clinical trials.

PTEN mutations have been reported in 1_11% of cholangiocarcinoma samples (Ong et al., 2012; 22561520, Jang et al., 2013; 24186137, Ross et al., 2014; 24563076). PTEN homozygous deletion was reported in fewer than 1% of gallbladder cancer cases (Narayan et al., 2019; 30427539). PTEN was not observed as a significantly altered gene in an analysis of biliary tract cancers (Nakamura et al., 2015; 26258846). In a study of 60 cholangiocarcinoma samples, 60% (36/60) showed a loss of PTEN expression (Kim et al., 2012; 22844568). Loss of PTEN expression has been reported in 51.8% of gallbladder adenocarcinomas (Liu and Yang, 2011; 21719208). Loss of PTEN has been associated with increased invasion, advanced tumor stage, and shorter survival in patients with cholangiocarcinoma (Kim et al., 2012; 22844568, Lee et al., 2012; 21874010, Chung et al., 2009; 19147772), and with poor prognosis in patients with gallbladder adenocarcinoma (Liu and Yang, 2011; 21719208). PTEN loss or mutation leads to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway (Courtney et al., 2010; 20085938, Simpson and Parsons, 2001; 11237521, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Milella et al., 2017; 28220839). A Phase 2 trial examining treatment with the PI3K inhibitor copanlisib in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin in biliary tract cancer reported longer response rates for patients with low PTEN expression (PFS of 8.5 months, OS of 18 months) compared with patients with high PTEN expression (PFS of 4.6 months, OS of 7.0 months); however, differences were not statistically significant (p=0.19) (Tan et al., 2021; 33289918). Preclinical data indicate that PTEN loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Mendes_Pereira et al., 2009; 20049735, Shen et al., 2013; 23881923, Chatterjee et al., 2013; 23565244, McCormick et al., 2016; 26905328, Forster et al., 2011; 21468130), and clinical benefit has been observed for patients with PTEN_altered breast cancer including triple negative breast cancer (Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006, Eikesdal et al., 2021; 33242536), ovarian cancer (Dougherty et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 5536), uterine leiomyosarcoma (Pan et al., 2021; 33970096), and endometrial cancer (Forster et al., 2011; 21468130) treated with PARP inhibitors. However, some studies have reported a lack of association between PTEN mutation and PARP inhibitor sensitivity (Sandhu et al., 2013; 23810788, Romero et al., 2020; 32988624, Piha_Paul et al., 2018; AACR Abstract A096). One or more of the PTEN variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with hamartoma tumor syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. PTEN mutations underlie several inherited disorders, collectively termed PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS), which include Cowden syndrome (CS) and its variant Lhermitte_Duclos disease (LD), Bannayan_Riley_Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), PTEN_related Proteus syndrome (PS), and Proteus_like syndrome (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191, Orloff and Eng, 2008; 18794875). The mutation rate for PTEN in these disorders ranges from 20 to 85% of patients (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191, Zbuk and Eng, 2007; 17167516). The estimated incidence of Cowden syndrome is 1/200,000, which may be an underestimate due to the high variability of this disorder (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191). Given the association between PTEN and these inherited syndromes, in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing for mutations affecting PTEN is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PTEN loss or inactivating mutations may lead to increased activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.

Alterations such as seen here may disrupt STK11 function or expression (Qui et al., 2007; 16407837, Mehenni et al., 1998; 9837816, Karuman et al., 2001; 11430832, Baas et al., 2003; 12805220, Zeng and Berger, 2006; 17108107, Boudeau et al., 2004; 15561763, Scott et al., 2007; 17575127, Xie et al., 2009; 19414597, Boudeau et al., 2003; 12552571, Forcet et al., 2005; 15800014, Zhang et al., 2015; 25960268, Berger et al., 2016; 27478040, Donnelly et al., 2021; 34849607). STK11 mutations have been reported in 3% of biliary tract carcinomas analyzed in the COSMIC database (Mar 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). STK11 mutation or loss have also been reported in biliary tract adenocarcinomas in the literature (Olschwang et al., 2001; 11389158, Su et al., 1999; 10362809, Sahin et al., 2003; 12861065). Loss of STK11 protein expression in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma has been reported as an independent predictor of shorter OS and time to recurrence (Wang et al., 2015; 26056085). Increased mTOR signaling is present in LKB1_deficient tumors, suggesting therapies targeting mTOR may be relevant for tumors with STK11 alterations (Shaw et al., 2004; 15261145, Ji et al., 2007; 17676035, Contreras et al., 2008; 18245476, Gurumurthy et al., 2008; 18172296, Shackelford et al., 2009; 19541609). Case studies have reported PRs for 2 patients with STK11_mutated pancreatic cancer following treatment with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (Kl\u00fcmpen et al., 2011; 21189378, Moreira et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 315), with 1 PR observed in a PJS patient for 9 months until progression (Kl\u00fcmpen et al., 2011; 21189378). However, retrospective analysis of a Phase 2 trial for patients with endometrial carcinoma found LKB1 (STK11) protein levels were not significantly correlated with response to everolimus treatment (Tredan et al., 2013; 23238879). In one preclinical study, STK11 loss was associated with sensitivity to combination treatment including an SRC inhibitor (Carretero et al., 2010; 20541700); however, the clinical relevance of these findings has not been established. STK11 alteration is associated with poorer response to immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with NSCLC, including those with tumors harboring co_occurring KRAS mutation (Skoulidis et al., 2018; 29773717, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Scheel et al., 2016; 27467949, Skoulidis et al., 2015; 26069186, Koyama et al., 2016; 26833127, Schabath et al., 2016; 26477306, Dong et al., 2017; 28039262, Kadara et al., 2017; 27687306, Herter_Sprie et al., 2016; 27699275) (Skoulidis et al., 2017; IASLC 17th World Congress on Lung Cancer Abstract MA04.07, Jure_Kunkel et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 3028, Stephens, 2017; AACR Abstract SY40_02, Skoulidis et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 11002, Skoulidis et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 11002). Germline mutations in STK11 underlie Peutz_Jeghers syndrome (PJS), a rare autosomal dominant disorder associated with a predisposition for tumor formation (Amos et al., 2004; 15121768). This disorder has an estimated frequency between 1:29,000 and 1:120,000, although reported rates in the literature vary greatly (Hearle et al., 2006; 16707622, Amos et al., 2004; 15121768, van der Groep et al., 2011; 21336636). Although gastrointestinal tumors are the most common malignancies associated with PJS, patients also exhibit an 18_fold increased risk of developing other epithelial cancers (Hearle et al., 2006; 16707622, Amos et al., 2004; 15121768, van der Groep et al., 2011; 21336636), and individuals with this syndrome have a 30_50% risk of developing breast cancer (Amos et al., 2004; 15121768, van der Groep et al., 2011; 21336636).

ASXL1 alterations occur infrequently across various solid tumor types (cBio_Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359) and are not known to act as drivers in any specific solid cancer type (Bailey et al., 2018; 29625053). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of ASXL1 alterations in solid tumors are limited (PubMed, May 2022). In the context of clonal hematopoiesis, ASXL1 mutations are significantly enriched in current or former smokers (Bolton et al., 2020; 33106634). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in ASXL1. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320).

Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. ESR1 mutation has not been reported in multiple cholangiocarcinoma datasets (cBio_Chan et al., 2013; 24185513, cBio_Ong et al., 2012; 22561520, cBio_Jiao et al., 2013; 24185509). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of ESR1 alterations in biliary tract carcinoma are limited (PubMed, Dec 2021). Therapies that directly target ER_alpha, such as selective ER modulators (SERMs) and the selective ER degrader (SERD) fulvestrant, as well as aromatase inhibitors (AIs) that inhibit estrogen production, are approved to treat ER_positive (ER+) and/or hormone receptor_positive (HR+) breast cancer (NCCN Guidelines v4.2022).

A significant number of inactivating KDM6A mutations have been found across multiple tumor types, suggesting a role as a tumor suppressor (van Haaften et al., 2009; 19330029). KDM6A mutations have been reported in 3.9% of samples analyzed, with the highest incidence in tumors of the urinary tract (31%), liver (7.3%), endometrium (6.7%), salivary gland (6.0%), and pancreas (5.1%) (COSMIC, Jan 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI_H is infrequent in cholangiocarcinoma, reported in 1% of samples (Javle et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 4087). A non_zero level of MSI has been reported in 18_49% of cholangiocarcinoma cases (Momoi et al., 2001; 11580146, Limpaiboon et al., 2002; 12175538, Liu et al., 2002; 12402306, Liengswangwong et al., 2003; 14506736), although the studies did not specify what fraction of cases were MSI_H. A higher frequency of MSI (63%) was reported in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma associated with exposure to Thorotrast (Liu et al., 2002; 12402306). One study reported that MSI is associated with poor prognosis in liver fluke_related cholangiocarcinoma (Limpaiboon et al., 2002; 12175538).

In preclinical studies, downregulation of RAD21 or other cohesin components leads to loss of expression from amplified genes, as well as amplifications themselves upon cell passaging (Yun et al., 2016; 26420833), but also leads to an increase in deletions, insertions, and other rearrangements (Gelot et al., 2016; 27326661). High RAD21 expression has also been associated with increased genomic instability (Yan et al., 2012; 22537934). Cohesin complex also organizes chromatin domains and regulates gene expression (Sofueva et al., 2013; 24185899, Deng et al., 2012; 23010778). Both overexpression and reduction of expression of RAD21 has been reported to alter gene expression (Yun et al., 2016; 27466323).

A study of 18 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients did not detect loss of heterozygosity at the chromosomal region 13q32 (where RB1 is located) in any cases (Kawaki et al., 2000; 11004673). However, studies have demonstrated that 12_41% of analyzed cholangiocarcinomas lack expression of Rb protein (Kang et al., 2002; 12378511, Tannapfel et al., 2002; 12210082). RB1 mutations have been reported across solid tumors including small cell lung cancer (60%), bladder (13%), uterine sarcoma (10%), non_melanoma skin cancer (9.5%), and gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors (9.3%) (Nguyen et al., 2022; 35120664). One analysis of 50 cholangiocarcinoma cases did not find a correlation between RB1 gene expression and disease metastasis (Boonjaraspinyo et al., 2012; 21750953). On the basis of limited clinical data (Owonikoko et al., 2016; ESMO Abstract 14230) and strong preclinical data (Hook et al., 2012; 22222631, Gong et al., 2019; 30373917, Oser et al., 2019; 30373918, Yang et al., 2022; 34741392), RB1 inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to inhibitors of Aurora kinase A, particularly in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). A clinical study evaluating the Aurora kinase A inhibitor alisertib for patients with prostate cancer did not find an association between RB1 deletion and clinical benefit (Beltran et al., 2019; 30232224). Other approaches to target RB1 inactivation under investigation in preclinical studies include inhibitors of BCL_2 family members (Allaman_Pillet et al., 2013; 21955141) and activation of the NOTCH pathway (Viatour et al., 2011; 21875955). It is not known whether these therapeutic approaches would be relevant in the context of alterations that have not been fully characterized, as seen here. One or more of the RB1 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with retinoblastoma (ClinVar, Sep 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Mutations in RB1 underlie the development of retinoblastoma (RB), a rare tumor that arises at a rate of approximately 1:20,000 live births, with nearly 5,000 new cases worldwide per year (Chen et al., 2014; 24282159). Germline mutations in RB1 account for approximately 40% of RB tumors (Yun et al., 2011; 22553621) and are associated with an increased risk of developing secondary malignancies that include soft tissue and bone sarcoma and malignant melanoma (Houston et al., 2011; 21139478, Ng et al., 2010; 19959033).

Inactivation of p53, through mutation, deletion, or loss of heterozygosity (LOH), has been observed in 25_63% of gallbladder carcinomas and 10_61% of cholangiocarcinomas (Li et al., 2014; 24997986, Ross et al., 2014; 24563076, Jiao et al., 2013; 24185509, Chan_On et al., 2013; 24185513, Borger et al., 2012; 22180306, Suto et al., 2000; 10738270, Ong et al., 2012; 22561520, Javle et al., 2016; 27622582, Nakamura et al., 2015; 26258846, Nault and Zucman_Rossi, 2011; 21538283). TP53 mutations occur more frequently in tumors caused by liver fluke (O. viverrini) infection (40%) than in cholangiocarcinoma cases not related to infection (9%) (Chan_On et al., 2013; 24185513). Aberrant TP53 expression, which is indicative of TP53 dysregulation, has been observed in 20\u201362% of gallbladder carcinomas and 25% (5/20) of cholangiocarcinomas (Won et al., 2010; 20955617, Chaube et al., 2006; 16686942, Chuang et al., 2004; 15573254). Data regarding the prognostic significance of TP53 mutation in cholangiocarcinoma are conflicting (Ruzzenente et al., 2016; 26717940, Xiaofang et al., 2012; 22230750, Ajiki et al., 1996; 8799388, Saetta, 2006; 16724348, Guo et al., 2014; 24746206, Boerner et al., 2021; 33765338, Conci et al., 2020; 32020551, Simbolo et al., 2018; 29740198, Churi et al., 2014; 25536104). Overexpression of p53 protein has been associated with reduced patient survival in poorly differentiated gallbladder adenocarcinomas and biliary tract cancers (Lee and Pirdas, 1995; 7567135, Ahrendt et al., 2000; 11180865); however, another study did not find such a correlation (Ajiki et al., 1996; 8799388). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Fraction", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor fraction provides an estimate of the percentage of ctDNA present in a cell_free DNA (cfDNA) sample. The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with elevated tumor fraction have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus high sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at low risk of false negative results. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels. In the research setting, changes in tumor fraction estimates have been associated with treatment duration and clinical response and may be a useful indicator for future cancer management (Bronkhorst et al., 2019; 30923679, Raja et al., 2018; 30093454, Hrebien et al., 2019; 30860573, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5039, Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Goodall et al., 2017; 28450425, Goldberg et al., 2018; 29330207).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "ZNF703", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "true", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "ZNF703 encodes a transcriptional repressor that plays roles in stem cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and other key cellular functions (Bazarov et al., 2011; 21635707, Sircoulomb et al., 2011; 21328542). Amplification of ZNF703 has been correlated with protein expression (Holland et al., 2011; 21337521, Sircoulomb et al., 2011; 21328542). ZNF703 was established as a breast cancer oncoprotein by studies showing that ZNF703 expression resulted in transformation and increased proliferation of cultured cells (Holland et al., 2011; 21337521, Slorach et al., 2011; 21317240, Sircoulomb et al., 2011; 21328542), as well as increased lung metastases in a breast cancer xenograft model (Slorach et al., 2011; 21317240). Amplification and high expression of ZNF703 has been observed in luminal B breast tumors, a subtype associated with aggressive disease progression and poor patient outcomes (Holland et al., 2011; 21337521, Sircoulomb et al., 2011; 21328542, Reynisdottir et al., 2013; 24156016). ZNF703 expression has also been linked with aggressive tumor characteristics in patients with gastric and colorectal cancers (Yang et al., 2014; 24481460, Ma et al., 2014; 25017610). Putative high_level amplification of ZNF703 has been reported with the highest frequency in breast carcinoma, bladder urothelial carcinoma, uterine carcinosarcoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), esophageal carcinoma and head and neck SCC (5_13% of samples)(cBioPortal, 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). There are no available targeted therapies to directly address ZNF703 alterations in cancer. One preclinical study suggested that ZNF703 expression in breast cancer cell lines is associated with reduced sensitivity to tamoxifen through AKT_mTOR activation (Zhang et al., 2013; 23991038),
