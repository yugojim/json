R132 is located within the active site of IDH1 and is a hotspot for mutations in cancer (Jin et al., 2011; 21326614, Gross et al., 2010; 20142433, Ward et al., 2010; 20171147, Leonardi et al., 2012; 22442146, Reitman and Yan, 2010; 20513808). Substitutions at IDH1 R132 alter the enzymatic activity of IDH1, resulting in the production of the oncometabolite, D_2_hydroxyglutarate (2_HG)(Dang et al., 2009; 19935646, Ward et al., 2012; 21996744, Ward et al., 2010; 20171147, Gross et al., 2010; 20142433, Leonardi et al., 2012; 22442146), which promotes tumorigenesis (Gross et al., 2010; 20142433, Figueroa et al., 2010; 21130701, Xu et al., 2011; 21251613, Turcan et al., 2012; 22343889, Duncan et al., 2012; 22899282). IDH1 or IDH2 mutation has been reported in 10_23% of cholangiocarcinoma cases and has been found to be more prevalent in intrahepatic (22_28%) than extrahepatic (0_7%) cholangiocarcinomas (Voss et al., 2013; 23391413, Sia et al., 2013; 23318457, Kipp et al., 2012; 22503487, Ross et al., 2014; 24563076, Borger et al., 2012; 22180306, Wang et al., 2013; 22824796). In patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, IDH1/2 mutations are associated with longer OS and increased time to tumor recurrence (Wang et al., 2013; 22824796). A preclinical study observed that mutant IDH can block hepatocyte differentiation and cooperate with oncogenic KRAS to drive cholangiocarcinoma development (Saha et al., 2014; 25043045). IDH1 mutations that lead to production of 2_HG, most commonly R132 alterations, may predict sensitivity to IDH1_mutation_specific inhibitors such as ivosidenib (Abou_Alfa et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA10, Fan et al., 2019; 31028664, Mellinghoff et al., 2017; SNO Abstract ACTR_46, Tap et al., 2016; CTOS Abstract P1_138). A Phase 1b/2 study of the IDH1 inhibitor olutasidenib for patients with IDH1_mutated glioma reported a DCR of 50% (n=24) with 1 PR (De La Fuente et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 2505). A Phase 1 study of the pan_IDH1/IDH2 inhibitor vorasidenib for patients with IDH1_ or IDH2_mutated glioma reported an ORR of 18.2% (4/22; RANO criteria) and median PFS of 31.4 months for non_enhancing cases and median PFS of 7.5 months for the overall glioma population (n=52) (Mellinghoff et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 2504). Preclinical studies suggested that IDH1 neomorphic mutations may also confer sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Philip et al., 2018; 29719265, Molenaar et al., 2018; 29339439, Lu et al., 2017; 28202508, Sulkowski et al., 2017; 28148839).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "IDH1 mutations may predict sensitivity to IDH1 inhibitors.

High bTMB levels were not detected in this sample. It is unclear whether the bTMB levels in this sample would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Depending on the clinical context, TMB testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. Average bTMB levels in solid tumors other than NSCLC have not been evaluated (cBioPortal, COSMIC, PubMed, Mar 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of bTMB levels in biliary tract cancer are limited (PubMed, Jul 2021). Although cases with hypermutated biliary tract cancer were enriched in a subgroup with poor prognosis in 1 study (Nakamura et al., 2015; 26258846), TMB_high (\u226510 mut/Mb) status in biliary adenocarcinoma not treated with immunotherapy was not significantly associated with OS in another study, in which patients with TMB_high tumors experienced numerically longer OS compared with patients with TMB_low tumors (11.5 vs. 8.4 months, adjusted HR=0.65) (Shao et al., 2020; 33119110). On the basis of clinical evidence in NSCLC and HSNCC, increased bTMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511) and anti_PD_1 (Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074) therapies. In NSCLC, multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 to 16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). In HNSCC, a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Cannot Be Determined", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Cannot Be Determined"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI_H is infrequent in cholangiocarcinoma, reported in 1% of samples (Javle et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 4087). A non_zero level of MSI has been reported in 18_49% of cholangiocarcinoma cases (Momoi et al., 2001; 11580146, Limpaiboon et al., 2002; 12175538, Liu et al., 2002; 12402306, Liengswangwong et al., 2003; 14506736), although the studies did not specify what fraction of cases were MSI_H. A higher frequency of MSI (63%) was reported in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma associated with exposure to Thorotrast (Liu et al., 2002; 12402306). One study reported that MSI is associated with poor prognosis in liver fluke_related cholangiocarcinoma (Limpaiboon et al., 2002; 12175538). On the basis of prospective clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD_1_targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143) and PD_L1_targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92). As the MSI status of this tumor is unknown, the relevance of these therapeutic approaches is unclear. While approximately 80% of MSI_H tumors arise due to somatic inactivation of an MMR pathway protein, about 20% arise due to germline mutations in one of the MMR genes (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942), which are associated with a condition known as Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC) (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756). Lynch syndrome leads to an increased risk of colorectal, endometrial, gastric, and other cancers (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756, Pande et al., 2012; 22714864, Kastrinos and Syngal, 2007; 17920897) and has an estimated prevalence in the general population ranging from 1:600 to 1:2000 (Silva et al., 2009; 19466295, Sehgal et al., 2014; 24978665, de la Chapelle et al., 2005; 16136383). Therefore, in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "SF3B1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "K700E", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "K700E"}}, "Interpretation": "SF3B1 encodes a subunit of the spliceosome, the complex that is responsible for the splicing of pre_mRNA molecules to create mature messenger RNA (Wang et al., 1998; 9585501, Quesada et al., 2011; 22158541, Wang et al., 2011; 22150006, Visconte et al., 2012; 22826563). SF3B1 mutations predominantly occur in HEAT domains 5_7 at codons 625, 662, 666, and 700 (Hahn et al., 2011; 22200771, Rossi et al., 2011; 22039264, Yang et al., 2013; 23390883, Patnaik et al., 2012; 22096241, Maguire et al., 2015; 25424858, Wan et al., 2013; 23568491), which result in neomorphic activity that upregulates aberrant mRNA splicing (Gentien et al., 2014; 24434863, De Boever et al., 2015; 2576898, Darman et al., 2015; 26565915, Alsafadi et al., 2016; 26842708). The consequences of SF3B1 alterations outside of these sites have not been extensively characterized. In the context of solid tumors, SF3B1 mutation has been reported in adenoid cystic carcinomas of the salivary gland (4%, 1/24) (Stephens et al., 2013; 23778141) and breast (Martelotto et al., 2015; 26095796) as well as in pancreatic carcinoma (Biankin et al., 2012; 23103869), glioblastoma, and renal clear cell carcinoma (Xie et al., 2014; 25326804). Mutation of SF3B1 was found to be recurrent in several breast carcinoma subtypes (Banerji et al., 2012; 22722202, Ellis et al., 2012; 22722193, Cancer Genome Atlas Network et al., 2012; 23000897), and in unselected breast cancers, it correlated with ER_positivity and frequent co_occurrence with AKT1 and PIK3CA mutations (Maguire et al., 2015; 25424858, Ellis et al., 2012; 22722193). The hot spot mutation K700E was found in 16% (3/19) of papillary and 6% of breast mucinous carcinomas (Maguire et al., 2015; 25424858). In solid tumors, the prognostic implications of SF3B1 alterations are dependent on disease context. In a study of 3282 breast cancer cases, SF3B1 mutation was significantly associated with a poor prognosis for patients with luminal B and progesterone receptor (PR)_negative subtypes of disease (Fu et al., 2017; 29383138). For patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, one study showed that SF3B1 mutation was associated with an advanced stage of disease (Nault et al., 2020; 31206197). However, in one study of primary uveal melanoma, SF3B1 mutation was correlated with improved PFS (Furney et al., 2013; 23861464). Preclinical studies suggest that mutations in genes encoding spliceosome components, including SF3B1, may confer sensitivity to spliceosome inhibitors (Obeng et al., 2016; 27622333, Lee et al., 2016; 27135740, Yoshimi et al., 2017; 27836865, Lee et al., 2016; 27603132, Singh et al., 2020; 32076118). In preclinical models, SF3B1 mutation leads to DNA damage and ATR_CHK1 pathway activation, increasing sensitivity to ATR and CHK1 inhibitors (Singh et al., 2020; 32076118). However, clinical data supporting SF3B1 as biomarkers for the efficacy of these approaches is lacking. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with elevated tumor fraction values have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus high sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at low risk of false negative results. However, if elevated tumor fraction is not detected, it does not exclude the presence of disease burden or compromise the confidence of reported alterations. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels. In the research setting, changes in tumor fraction estimates have been associated with treatment duration and clinical response and may be a useful indicator for future cancer management (Bronkhorst et al., 2019; 30923679, Raja et al., 2018; 30093454, Hrebien et al., 2019; 30860573, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5039, Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Goodall et al., 2017; 28450425, Goldberg et al., 2018; 29330207).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "IDH1", "Alteration": "R132C", "Title": "Ascending Doses of AZD6738 in Combination With Chemotherapy and/or Novel Anti Cancer Agents", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1/2", "Target": "ATR, PARP, PD_L1", "Locations": "Seongnam_si (Korea, Republic of), Seoul (Korea, Republic of), Cambridge (United Kingdom), Withington (United Kingdom), London (United Kingdom), Sutton (United Kingdom), Villejuif (France), Saint Herblain (France), California", "NCTID": "NCT02264678", "Note": "IDH1 mutations may predict sensitivity to IDH1 inhibitors.
