Loss of functional ATM promotes tumorigenesis (Cremona and Behrens, 2014; 23851492). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt ATM function or expression (Jiang et al., 2006; 16603769, Fernandes et al., 2005; 15713674, Scott et al., 2002; 11805335). ATM mutations have been reported in 1% of glioblastoma cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890). An analysis of Grades 1_4 astrocytomas detected upregulation of ATM mRNA expression (Kheirollahi et al., 2011; 20077038). Higher expression of the ATM protein correlated with longer overall and progression_free survival in a study of 69 glioblastoma cases (Seol et al., 2011; 21617879). However, ATM gene and protein expression in glioblastoma cells has also been correlated with resistance to radiation therapy; glioma cells with lower ATM expression have been found to be more sensitive to radiation than cells with higher ATM expression (Tribius et al., 2001; 11380241, Roy et al., 2006; 16631604, Biddlestone_Thorpe et al., 2013; 23620409). In addition, one study reported that the ATM kinase inhibitor KU_60019 inhibited glioma cell growth and invasion and sensitized cells to radiation (Biddlestone_Thorpe et al., 2013; 23620409). Preclinical studies have also shown that ATM kinase inactivation and ATM inhibitors such as LY294002 and KU_55933 increase the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to cisplatin and temozolomide (Carminati et al., 2013; 24218165, Nadkarni et al., 2012; 23054561, Eich et al., 2013; 23960094). Loss of functional ATM results in a defective DNA damage response and homologous recombination_mediated DNA repair and may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Michels et al., 2014; 24037533). Clinical data in prostate cancer (Mateo et al., 2015; 26510020, Mateo et al., 2020; 31806540, de Bono et al., 2020; ASCO GU Abstract 119, Abida et al., 2020; 32086346), gastric cancer (Bang et al., 2015; 26282658), colorectal cancer (Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006), breast cancer (Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006), papillary renal cell carcinoma (Olson et al., 2016; 27079472), and cholangiocarcinoma (Piha_Paul et al., 2018; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract A096) indicate that loss or inactivation of ATM may confer sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Weston et al., 2010; 20739657, Williamson et al., 2010; 20124459, Gilardini et al., 2013; 24252502, Bryant and Helleday, 2006; 16556909, Ihnen et al., 2013; 23729402, Williamson et al., 2012; 22416035, Kubota et al., 2014; 24841718, Huehls et al., 2012; 22833573). In Phase 1 trials of ATR inhibitors, a heavily pretreated patient with colorectal cancer who achieved a CR to berzosertib (O Carrigan et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2504) and 4 out of 4 patients with diverse solid tumors who achieved PRs to BAY1895344 (Yap et al., 2020; 32988960) harbored ATM inactivation or protein loss; studies showing reduced cell viability and increased DNA damage in preclinical models of solid tumors (Menezes et al., 2015; 25232030, Vendetti et al., 2015; 26517239, Min et al., 2017; 28138034) and hematologic malignancies (Menezes et al., 2015; 25232030, Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132) also support the increased sensitivity of ATM_deficient cells to ATR inhibitors. Preclinical experiments also indicate that loss of ATM causes dependency on DNA_PKcs in cancer cells; DNA_PKcs inhibitors promoted apoptosis in ATM_deficient cells and were active in a lymphoma mouse model lacking ATM activity (Riabinska et al., 2013; 23761041). One or more of the ATM variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with ataxia_telangiectasia syndrome (ClinVar, Mar 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. ATM mutation carriers have increased cancer risk, with female carriers displaying a 38% lifetime risk of breast cancer (van Os et al., 2016; 26662178). Biallelic mutations in ATM underlie the rare autosomal_recessive inherited disorder ataxia_telangiectasia (A_T), also referred to as genome instability or DNA damage response syndrome (Rothblum_Oviatt et al., 2016; 27884168). This disease is characterized by genomic instability, sensitivity to DNA_damaging agents, and increased risk of developing cancer (Shiloh and Ziv, 2013; 23847781, Rothblum_Oviatt et al., 2016; 27884168). The prevalence of A_T is estimated at 1:40,000 to 1:100,000 worldwide (Rothblum_Oviatt et al., 2016; 27884168). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of ATM is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors may detect nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

Alterations such as seen here may disrupt MEN1 function or expression (La et al., 2004; 15044367, La et al., 2006; 16449969, Yaguchi et al., 2004; 15254225, Agarwal et al., 1999; 9989505, Shimazu et al., 2011; 21819486, Canaff et al., 2012; 22090276). MEN1 mutation has been observed in <1% of glioblastoma and lower grade glioma samples in the TCGA dataset (cBio_Sanchez_Vega et al., 2018; 29625050). However, biallelic inactivation of MEN1 was identified in a pediatric patient with grade 2 pilocytic astrocytoma (Karges et al., 2003; 12860285). One study found that high menin expression was correlated with shorter OS and larger tumor volume in glioma (Wang et al., 2020; 31383953). There are no therapies, either approved or in clinical trials, that directly target mutation or loss of MEN1. Preclinical studies in cells and transgenic mice have shown that tumor formation mediated by loss of MEN1 (a direct activator of p18INK4c) is associated with increased expression and activity of CDK4 and that CDK4 knockout abrogates formation of MEN1 loss_driven tumors (Karnik et al., 2005; 16195383, Bai et al., 2007; 17145768, Hussein et al., 2008; 18310289, Gillam et al., 2014; 24531709). Therefore, tumors with MEN1 loss or inactivation may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as ribociclib, abemaciclib, and palbociclib (Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Finn et al., 2014; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27217383), although this has not been demonstrated clinically. One or more of the MEN1 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome (ClinVar, Mar 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669, Wautot et al., 2002; 12112656, Agarwal et al., 1997; 9215689, Kouvaraki et al., 2002; 12049533, Teh et al., 1998; 9709921, Bassett et al., 1998; 9463336, Tala et al., 2006; 17185897). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in MEN1 are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN1) syndrome, an autosomal dominant hereditary cancer syndrome characterized most commonly by pancreatic endocrine tumors (in 40_70% of patients), pituitary adenomas (in 30_40% of patients), and parathyroid adenomas (Gaztambide et al., 2013; 23435440, Sakurai et al., 2009; 19564705). In addition, a small subset of breast cancers may be associated with germline MEN1 mutation (Sakurai et al., 2009; 19564705, Honda et al., 2004; 15168774). Prevalence for this disorder in the general population is estimated to be 1:30,000 (Marini et al., 2008; 17014705), and in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of MEN1 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Based on limited clinical and preclinical evidence, tumors with MEN1 loss or inactivation may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT03099174", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04391595", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03834740", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02981940", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03158389", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02896335", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03065062", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03220646", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03434262", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MSI_High", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MSI_High"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample has a high level of MSI, equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSI_high (MSI_H) tumor: one with mutations in >30% of microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI_H status indicates high_level deficiency in MMR and typically correlates with loss of expression of at least one, and often two, MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). Low_level MSI has been reported in 5_9% of glioblastoma (GBM) samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927, Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285, Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). A large_scale study did not find high_level microsatellite instability (MSI_H) in any of 129 GBM samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), although a small_scale study reported MSI_H in 4 of 15 pediatric GBMs and 1 of 12 adult GBMs (Szybka et al., 2003; 12908754). The frequency of MSI has been reported to be increased in relapsed compared to primary GBM (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), in GBMs with a previous lower grade astrocytoma (Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285), and in giant cell GBM compared to classic GBM (Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). On the basis of prospective clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, MSI and associated increased mutational burden (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to anti_PD_1 and anti_PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92)(Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including the approved therapies nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab) (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436), pembrolizumab (Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92). While approximately 80% of MSI_H tumors arise due to somatic inactivation of an MMR pathway protein, about 20% arise due to germline mutations in one of the MMR genes (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942), which are associated with a condition known as Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC) (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756). Lynch syndrome leads to an increased risk of colorectal, endometrial, gastric, and other cancers (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756, Pande et al., 2012; 22714864, Kastrinos and Syngal, 2007; 17920897) and has an estimated prevalence in the general population ranging from 1:600 to 1:2000 (Silva et al., 2009; 19466295, Sehgal et al., 2014; 24978665, de la Chapelle et al., 2005; 16136383).

Selumetinib has demonstrated clinical activity in low_grade glioma. A Phase 2 study of selumetinib for patients with low_grade glioma (LGG) reported 8/25 PR for patients with BRAF alterations and 10/25 PR for those with NF1_associated LGG (Fangusaro et al., 2019; 31151904) and a Phase 1 study for selumetinib reported 5/25 PR for LGG patients (Banerjee et al., 2017; 28339824).

PDGFR aberrations, including point mutations, translocations, amplification, and/or overexpression, have been associated with various malignancies (Fletcher, 2004; 15175998). Many PDGFRA missense mutations, such as seen here, have been characterized as activating (Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251, Corless et al., 2005; 15928335, Elling et al., 2011; 21224473, Dai et al., 2013; 24132921, Lasota et al., 2004; 15146165). As a class, these mutations have also been shown in preclinical assays to confer sensitivity to targeted therapies, such as imatinib and crenolanib (Velghe et al., 2013; 23752188, Dai et al., 2013; 24132921, Lasota et al., 2004; 15146165, Corless et al., 2005; 15928335, Paugh et al., 2013; 23970477).

PDGFRA mutations have been reported in 0_5% of lower grade glioma and glioblastoma samples (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890, cBio_Hoadley et al., 2018; 29625048, cBio_Ellrott et al., 2018; 29596782, cBio_Taylor et al., 2018; 29622463, cBio_Gao et al., 2018; 29617662, cBio_Liu et al., 2018; 29625055, cBio_Sanchez_Vega et al., 2018; 29625050), Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751, cBio_Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, cBio_Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509, cBio_Jones et al., 2013; 23817572). A retrospective analysis of TCGA glioma samples reported elevated expression of ERBB3 correlated with PDGFRA expression and co_expression of these genes was an indicator of poor prognosis in a GBM patient cohort (Song et al., 2018; 29888103). Amplification of PDGFRA has been associated with tumor grade and poor progression_free and overall survival in patients with glioblastoma (Alentorn et al., 2012; 23074200, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035). In addition, PDGFRA amplification has been reported to occur in conjunction with IDH1 mutation in glioblastoma, and both alterations in the same tumor have been associated with poor patient prognosis (Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035). On the basis of extensive clinical evidence in solid tumors and hematologic cancers, PDGFRA activating alterations are associated with sensitivity to imatinib (Arefi et al., 2012; 22806436, Baccarani et al., 2007; 17666373, Cassier et al., 2012; 22718859, Chalmers et al., 2015; 25658984, Cools et al., 2003; 12660384, Curtis et al., 2007; 17555450, Debiec_Rychter et al., 2016; 15010069, Dileo et al., 2011; 20473908, Fanta et al., 2015; 24638008, Florian et al., 2006; 16406018, Frenard et al., 2016; 27051816, Griffin et al., 2003; 12808148, Heinrich et al., 2003; 14645423, Helbig et al., 2009; 19120352, Helbig et al., 2014; 24009127, Hus et al., 2011; 21093052, Ikezoe et al., 2010; 20303172, Intermesoli et al., 2009; 19735261, Jain et al., 2009; 19013640, Jovanovic et al., 2007; 17299092, Kang et al., 2012; 22150077, Klion et al., 2004; 14504092, Kobayashi et al., 2009; 19192229, Koc\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al., 2014; 24635438, Metzgeroth et al., 2008; 18950453, Murayama et al., 2012; 22645636, Ogbogu et al., 2009; 19910029, Ohnishi et al., 2006; 16856885, Pardanani et al., 2003; 12842979, Pardanani et al., 2004; 15284118, Qu et al., 2016; 27120808, Score et al., 2006; 16498388, Shah et al., 2011; 24669761, Sugimoto et al., 2015; 26319757, Volz et al., 2011; 20609486, von Bubnoff et al., 2005; 15618966, Walz et al., 2006; 16845659, Yoo et al., 2016; 26130666).

One study detected PIK3R1 mutation in 10% (24/232) of IDH_wildtype glioblastoma (GBM) samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). In the TCGA datasets, PIK3R1 mutation is most frequently observed in endometrial carcinoma (33%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2013; 23636398), glioblastoma (GBM; 11%)(cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142), uterine carcinosarcoma (11%)(cBioPortal, 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210), and lower grade glioma (5%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751). PIK3R1 is often inactivated by in_frame insertions or deletions (indels), and the majority of this class of mutation (80%) was observed in endometrial carcinoma (Ye et al., 2016; 26657142, Cheung et al., 2011; 21984976, Urick et al., 2011; 21478295), although PIK3R1 indels have been reported in other cancer types such as GBM, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, and urothelial bladder carcinoma (Ye et al., 2016; 26657142). On the basis of limited clinical data, reduced PIK3R1 expression has been associated with reduced disease_free survival in prostate cancer (Munkley et al., 2015; 26501081) and metastasis_free survival in breast cancer (Cizkova et al., 2013; 24229379).

In patients with PIK3R1 mutation and no other alterations in the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway, 2 CRs have been achieved by patients with endometrial cancer treated with the pan_PI3K inhibitor pilaralisib (Matulonis et al., 2015; 25528496), and 1 PR has been achieved by a patient with breast cancer treated with the PI3K_alpha inhibitor alpelisib in combination with ribociclib and letrozole (Juric et al., 2016; SABCS Abstract P3_14_01).

This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents, for patients with glioma (Touat et al., 2020; 32322066, Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556, Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642). Although efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors has been observed for patients with other solid tumor types harboring TMB levels such as seen here (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), an association between TMB and clinical benefit has generally not been observed for patients with glioma (Touat et al., 2020; 32322066, Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254), except for those with ultramutated glioma with POLE mutation (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556, Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642). Glioblastoma (GBM) harbors a median TMB of 2.7 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 4.2% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). For pediatric patients, high TMB has been reported in a subset of high_grade gliomas, frequently in association with mutations in mismatch repair or proofreading genes and in TP53, whereas BRAF alterations or other oncogene fusions were observed more frequently in brain tumors harboring low TMB (Patel et al., 2020; 32386112, Johnson et al., 2017; 28912153). Increased TMB has been reported to correlate with higher tumor grade in glioma (Draaisma et al., 2015; 26699864) and glioblastoma (GBM) tissue samples with biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD) (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570), as well as with shorter OS of patients with diffuse glioma (Wang et al., 2020; 32164609). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In glioma, a lack of association between TMB and clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors has been reported (Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Touat et al., 2020; 32322066).

CBL alterations that result in loss or disruption of the tyrosine kinase binding domain, RING finger domain, and/or tail domain, as observed here, are predicted to be inactivating and to promote tumorigenesis (Andonoiou et al., 1994; 7925293, Aranaz et al., 2012; 22315494, Fernandes et al., 2010; 20622007, Grand et al., 2009; 19387008, Javadi et al., 2013; 23696637, Kassenbrock et al., 2004; 15117950, Levkowitz et al., 1999; 10635327, Loh et al., 2009; 19571318, Martinelli et al., 2010; 20619386, Saito et al., 2012; 22591685, Sanada et al., 2009; 19620960, Score et al., 2012; 22053108, Shiba et al., 2011; 21494262, Standaert et al., 2004; 15581361, Tan et al., 2010; 20126411, Thien et al., 2001; 11239464, Visser and Lill, 2005; 16246327, Li et al., 2016; 26676746). CBL mutation has been reported in <1% of lower grade glioma and glioblastoma samples (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751, cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). High expression of c_Cbl has been reported to correlate with poor prognosis in glioma (Jing et al., 2016; 27073553). In preclinical studies, CBL has been shown to promote glioma cell invasion and glioblastoma tumor growth in mice (Seong et al., 2014; 25450678, Stevens et al., 2014; 24458840). CBL inactivation may lead to the hyperactivation of various receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including MET (Mancini et al., 2002; 11847211), PDGFRA (Miyake et al., 1998; 9653117), KIT (Masson et al., 2006; 16780420), VEGFR2 (Singh et al., 2007; 17372230), and the TAM (TYRO3, AXL, MER) RTKs (Paolino et al., 2014; 24553136). These RTKs are targets of the multikinase inhibitor sitravatinib (Patwardhan et al., 2016; 26675259), which has shown activity in CBL_mutated advanced solid tumors (Bazhenova et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 408O). Among 8 patients with CBL inactivating alterations in a Phase 1b trial, sitravatinib produced 2 PRs (25% ORR), with 1 NSCLC and 1 melanoma responding for over 4 months, and 4 SD outcomes, with 3 prolonged SDs seen in a patient with NSCLC, a patient with esophageal cancer, and a patient with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (Bazhenova et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 408O). CBL has been shown to downregulate EGFR (Shtiegman et al., 2007; 17486068, Padr\u00f3n et al., 2007; 17699773, Hosaka et al., 2007; 17695511, Han et al., 2006; 16969069, Yang et al., 2006; 16849543) and FLT3 (Sargin et al., 2007; 17446348, Oshikawa et al., 2011; 21768087, Reindl et al., 2009; 19276253). Preclinical models of myeloid malignancies have demonstrated that CBL inactivation confers sensitivity to the FLT3_targeting therapies sunitinib (Sargin et al., 2007; 17446348), midostaurin (Reindl et al., 2009; 19276253), and quizartinib (Taylor et al., 2012; 22990016), as well as to dasatinib (Makishima et al., 2012; 22246246), although clinical evidence for this approach in solid tumors is lacking. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

Parafibromin has been reported to inhibit MYC and CCND1 (Yang et al., 2010; 19906718, Lin et al., 2008; 18987311, Zheng et al., 2011; 21315421, Masi et al., 2014; 24842573, Woodard et al., 2005; 15580289), as well as cell proliferation (Rather et al., 2013; 23166327, Rather et al., 2014; 24257751, Zhang et al., 2006; 16989776, Woodard et al., 2005; 15580289).

Inactivating germline mutations in CDC73 are causal in hyperparathyroidism_jaw tumor syndrome (Carpten et al., 2002; 12434154), and frequent somatic mutation has been documented in parathyroid carcinoma (PC); however, CDC73 mutation is rare in benign parathyroid adenoma (Krebs et al., 2005; 15956079). Heterozygous germline inactivation of CDC73 has additionally been suggested to be a predisposing factor for PC (Shattuck et al., 2003; 14585940). Loss of parafibromin expression and to some extent CDC73 mutation has been correlated with higher incidence of metastasis, disease recurrence, and in some cases decreased overall survival in patients with PC (Cetani et al., 2013; 24145611, Witteveen et al., 2011; 21240254). CDC73 down_regulation has also been observed in oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC), and knockdown of CDC73 results in increased cell viability and proliferation in preclinical OSCC models (Rather et al., 2013; 23166327, Rather et al., 2014; 24257751).

CDKN1A is a target gene of the tumor suppressor p53 (el_Deiry et al., 1993; 8242752) that is a critical mediator of p53_dependent cell cycle arrest (Bunz et al., 1998; 9822382, Waldman et al., 1995; 7585571). In addition to its tumor suppressive role, p21 has also been shown to have oncogenic functions (Abbas and Dutta., 2009; 19440234). CDKN1A mutation is infrequently observed in most cancer types, occurring in 0.6% of cases in a pan_cancer analysis of the TCGA datasets (Kandoth et al., 2013; 24132290). However, CDKN1A mutations, most of which were predicted to be inactivating mutations, were observed frequently (14%) in bladder cancer (Cazier et al., 2014; 24777035, The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 24476821), suggesting that CDKN1A may function as a tumor suppressor in this context. There are currently no therapies that target alterations in CDKN1A. However, in one preclinical study, bladder cancer cell lines with concurrent inactivation of CDKN1A and TP53 were reported to have increased sensitivity to the combination of gemcitabine with a CHK1 inhibitor (Liu and Kwiatkowski., 2015; 25349305).

Dysregulation of JAK_STAT signaling has been implicated in a variety of epithelial tumors (Levine, 2012; 21823028). However, JAK_STAT signaling is required for the antiviral and antiproliferative effects of interferons (Pansky et al., 2000; 10699955). JAK1 alterations that result in the disruption or loss of the kinase domain (875_1153), as seen here, are predicted to be inactivating. JAK1 truncating mutations have been reported in approximately 8% of gynecological tumors in one study and characterized to be defective for interferon_gamma_induced tumor antigen presentation, suggesting that JAK1 truncating mutations could contribute to tumor immune evasion in gynecologic cancers (Ren et al., 2013; 24154688). On the basis of emerging clinical and preclinical data, inactivating mutations in JAK1 have been suggested to play a role in both primary and acquired resistance to anti_PD_1 immunotherapy, via the proposed mechanism of reduction in interferon_gamma_mediated PD_L1 activation (Zaretsky et al., 2016; 27433843, Shin et al., 2017; 27903500). In the TCGA datasets, JAK1 mutation or amplification was observed in ~1% of glioblastoma cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142) and was not observed in any lower grade gliomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751). A study of 96 glioma patients reported increased levels of JAK1 protein, and JAK1 phosphorylation was higher in glioma samples than in normal brain tissue (Tu et al., 2011; 20135364). High levels of JAK1 protein were correlated with poor prognosis in glioma patients (Tu et al., 2011; 20135364). Inhibitors of the JAK_STAT pathway are under development. The JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib is approved to treat myelofibrosis, and has shown efficacy in reducing symptoms in Phase 1 and 2 trials in patients with myeloproliferative disorders (Verstovsek et al., 2013; 23480528, Naqvi et al., 2011; 21635221, Verstovsek et al., 2012; 22718840). Other small molecule inhibitors of JAK1 are being investigated in preclinical studies in some types of solid tumors (Swiatek_Machado et al., 2012; 22555804, Yan et al., 2013; 23531921). HSP90 inhibitors are also being investigated in preclinical studies to target components of the JAK_STAT pathway such as JAK1 (Wang et al., 2010; 21154128).

Upon binding of membrane_bound ligands, NOTCH signaling involves cleavage of the NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD), which subsequently forms part of a transcription factor complex that regulates downstream target genes (Penton et al., 2012; 22306179, Kopan and Ilagan, 2009; 19379690). Alterations that preserve the ANK repeat region and disrupt or remove the PEST domain have been reported to increase activity of NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 (Aster et al., 2000; 11003647, Weng et al., 2004; 15472075, Lee et al., 2009; 19445024, Zhang et al., 2014; 25314575). Similar mutations in NOTCH3, such as observed here, have been reported in cancer (Egloff and Grandis, 2012; 22773520) and are likely to also be activating. NOTCH3 amplification and mutation have been observed in up to 1.0% and 4.9% of glioblastomas, respectively, and in up to 2.1% and 3.3% of lower grade gliomas, respectively (cBioPortal, Mar 2021)(cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751). NOTCH3 amplification was associated with poorer survival in glioblastoma compared to non_amplified cases in one study (median survival 10 vs. 28 months)(Alqudah et al., 2013; 24143218). Several approaches for inhibiting NOTCH3 signaling are being developed, including neutralizing NOTCH antibodies such as tarextumab (OMP_59R5) (Yen et al., 2015; 25934888), which targets NOTCH2 and NOTCH3, and pan_NOTCH inhibitors, such as gamma_secretase inhibitors (GSI) (Hu et al., 2014; 24743243, Konishi et al., 2007; 17804716, Xiao et al., 2011; 20838375).

Phase 2 studies have evaluated the efficacy of tarextumab in combination with chemotherapy in metastatic pancreatic cancer or extensive_stage small cell lung cancer, though NOTCH3 expression was not found to be a predictor of OS or PFS in either study (Hu et al., 2019; 31347292; O\u2019Reilly et al., 2015; Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium Abstract 278, Daniel et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 1530PD).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "P2RY8", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "R222H", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "R222H"}}, "Interpretation": "P2RY8 encodes a G_protein_coupled purinergic receptor (P2RY8); members of this family of receptors are activated by adenosine and uridine nucleotides (Burnstock, 2006; 16507883).

The P2RY8_CRLF2 fusion is a hallmark alteration in pediatric B_cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, particularly in cases associated with Down syndrome (NCCN Pediatric ALL Guidelines, v2.2021)(Arber et al., 2016; 27069254)(Mullighan et al., 2009; 19838194). In another study, P2RY8 expression was observed to be downregulated in relapsed compared to initially diagnosed multiple myeloma (Krzeminski et 2016; 27811368). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in P2RY8.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "SETD2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "S2382fs*29", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "S2382fs*29"}}, "Interpretation": "SETD2 encodes a histone lysine_36 methyltransferase (Sun et al., 2005; 16118227) that preferentially interacts with the expanded N_terminal polyglutamine tracts present in mutant huntingtin, implicating it in the pathogenesis of Huntington disease (Faber et al., 1998; 9700202). SETD2 mRNA expression has been observed to be consistently reduced in breast tumors relative to adjacent non_tumor tissue, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role (Al Sarakbi et al., 2009; 19698110). SETD2 alterations such as observed here have been shown to be inactivating (Parker et al., 2016; 27282254, Zhang et al., 2012; 22237106, McKinney et al., 2017; 28122867, Moffitt et al., 2017; 28424246, Zhu et al., 2014; 24509477, Lu et al., 2016; 27174990). Somatic inactivating alterations of SETD2 are documented to occur at low frequency in a number of solid tumors, most commonly in renal carcinoma (Varela et al., 2011; 21248752). SETD2 has been associated with favorable prognosis in gastric cancer (Chen et al., 2018; 29522714). SETD2 has also been associated with poor prognosis in RCC and MDS (Chen et al., 2020; 32202636, Liu et al.,; 2015; 26559293), while data in other tumor types is limited (PubMed, Jun 2021).

SMARCA4 is inactivated in a variety of cancers and considered a tumor suppressor (Shain and Pollack, 2013; 23355908). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt SMARCA4 function or expression (Trotter et al., 2008; 18086889, Shen et al., 2007; 17274598, Dykhuizen et al., 2013; 23698369, Stanton et al., 2016; 27941795, Fernando et al., 2020; 33144586). In the TCGA datasets, SMARCA4 mutation was observed in 4.5% of lower grade glioma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751) and <1% of glioblastoma cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). BRG1 expression has been reported to be increased in glioma tumors, compared to the surrounding normal tissue, and this study suggested that this increase may contribute to cell proliferation, migration, and/or invasion of glioma cells (Bai et al., 2012; 22362300). One study reported that certain germline polymorphisms in SMARCA4 are associated with increased risk of oligodendroglioma but not astrocytoma or glioblastoma (Amankwah et al., 2013; 23276717). Clinical (Jones et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 1612PD, Italiano et al., 2018; 29650362, Penebre et al., 2015; EORTC Abstract C87) and preclinical (Jelinic et al., 2016; 26564006, Karnezis et al., 2016; 26356327, Penebre et al., 2015; EORTC Abstract C87, Kim et al., 2015; 26552009, Chan_Penebre et al., 2017; 28292935, Januario et al., 2017; 29087303, Wang et al., 2017; 28444909, Wang et al., 2018; 30232145) data suggest that patients with small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) harboring SMARCA4 loss or inactivation may benefit from treatment with EZH2 inhibitors, including tazemetostat. In addition, preclinical data have demonstrated that SMARCA4_deficient non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and SCCOHT patient_derived xenografts and cell lines are highly sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibition through a synthetic lethal mechanism of reduced cyclin D1 expression (Xue et al., 2019; 30718512, Xue et al., 2019; 30718506 ). Notably, similar drug sensitivity was detected in SMARCA4_deficient lung and ovarian tumors, thereby suggesting that SMARCA4_deficient tumors are likely to be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibition regardless of tissue of origin (Xue et al., 2019; 30718512, Xue et al., 2019; 30718506). Downregulation of BRG1 and BRM was reported to enhance cellular sensitivity to cisplatin in lung and head and neck cancer cells (Kothandapani et al., 2012; 22721696). In vitro studies have shown that SCCOHT cell lines are sensitive to treatment with epothilone B, methotrexate, and topotecan, compared to treatment with other chemotherapies such as platinum_containing compounds; similar sensitivity was not observed for treatment with ixabepilone, a compound closely related to epothilone B (Otte et al., 2014; 25103190).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "T125M, R248Q", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": [{"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "T125M"}, {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "R248Q"}]}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). In the TCGA dataset, TP53 alterations have been reported in 35% of glioblastomas (GBMs), with a high incidence in pediatric and secondary GBMs and a low incidence in primary GBMs (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890, Jha et al., 2011; 22089350). One study detected TP53 alterations in 31% (73/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed, with most of the events being mutations (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). TP53 mutations have been reported in 18_40% of astrocytoma samples, and preferentially in anaplastic astrocytoma; one study reported TP53 loss of function and partially/fully functional mutations in 15% and 25% of anaplastic astrocytomas, respectively (Uno et al., 2005; 15914282, Uno et al., 2006; 16711514, Lass et al., 2012; 22844452, Faria et al., 2012; 23009112, Milinkovic et al., 2013; 24358143, Galatro et al., 2013; 23613880). Some studies suggest that the presence of a TP53 mutation is correlated with a favorable prognosis in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) (Schmidt et al., 2002; 11939587). One study reported that TP53 alterations were associated with poorer OS (12.9 months altered vs. 19.7 months wildtype, HR=1.58, p=0.0054) in IDH_wildtype GBM (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Mutation of TP53 is thought to be an early step in the tumorigenesis of astrocytomas, which can progress into anaplastic astrocytoma and then glioblastoma through gain of other genetic abnormalities such as loss of CDKN2A or RB1, followed by loss of PTEN (Nozaki et al., 1999; 11550308). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% (17/176) and SDs in 53.4% (94/176) of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21.1% (4/19) in patients with TP53 mutations versus 12.1% (4/33) in patients who were TP53 wild_type (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 31.9% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73.4% (69/94) DCR in patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 42.9% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76.2% (16/21) DCR in patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24.0% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71.4% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel in patients with solid tumors, 75.0% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Additionally, the combination of a CHK1 inhibitor and irinotecan reportedly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival in a TP53_mutated, but not TP53_wild_type, breast cancer xenotransplant mouse model (Ma et al., 2012; 22446188). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may also be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as APR_246 (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571, Lehmann et al., 2012; 22965953, Mohell et al., 2015; 26086967, Franssonet al., 2016; 27179933). In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, APR_246 combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Mar 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true",
