Mutation, loss, or inactivation of ARID1A has been reported in many cancers, and the gene is considered a tumor suppressor (Guan et al., 2011; 21900401, Jones et al., 2012; 22009941, Wiegand et al., 2010; 20942669, Jones et al., 2010; 20826764, Yan et al., 2014; 24293408, Wang et al., 2012; 22808142, Huang et al., 2012; 22922871, Chan_On et al., 2013; 24185513, Mamo et al., 2012; 21892209). ARID1A mutations, which are mostly truncating, have been identified along the entire gene and often correlate with ARID1A protein loss (Jones et al., 2012; 22009941, Wiegand et al., 2010; 20942669, Jones et al., 2010; 20826764, Zang et al., 2012; 22484628, Wang et al., 2011; 22037554), whereas ARID1A missense mutations are mostly uncharacterized. ARID1A alterations are particularly prevalent in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (46_50%), ovarian and uterine endometrioid carcinomas (24_44%), and cholangiocarcinoma (27%); they are also reported in up to 27% of gastric carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, pediatric Burkitt lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, and urothelial carcinoma samples analyzed (COSMIC, cBioPortal, Jan 2022) (Tate et al., 2019; 30371878, Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Wu et al., 2014; 24618703, Jones et al., 2012; 22009941, Dulak et al., 2013; 23525077, Streppel et al., 2013; 23318448, Jiao et al., 2014; 24293293, Ross et al., 2014; 24563076). ARID1A loss is associated with microsatellite instability in ovarian and endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinomas (Huang et al., 2014; 25195947, Hussein et al., 2014; 25394778, Bosse et al., 2013; 23702729, Allo et al., 2014; 23887303, Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729), CRC (Chou et al., 2014; 24925223, Ye et al., 2014; 25311944, Wei et al., 2014; 25561809, Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729), and gastric cancer (Chen et al., 2015; 25583476, Wang et al., 2011; 22037554, Abe et al., 2012; 22915242, Wang et al., 2012; 22808142, Wiegand et al., 2014; 24767857, Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729). ARID1A protein loss is associated with tumors of poor histological grade for many tumor types, including colorectal cancer (CRC) (Chou et al., 2014; 24925223, Ye et al., 2014; 25311944, Wei et al., 2014; 25561809), cervical cancer (Katagiri et al., 2012; 22274316, Cho et al., 2013; 23427874), gastric cancer (Chen et al., 2015; 25583476, Wang et al., 2011; 22037554, Abe et al., 2012; 22915242, Wang et al., 2012; 22808142, Wiegand et al., 2014; 24767857), urothelial carcinoma (Gui et al., 2011; 21822268, Balbas_Martinez et al., 2013; 23650517, Faraj et al., 2014; 25175170), ovarian and endometrial cancers (Rahman et al., 2013; 22939958, Maeda et al., 2010; 21614196, Lowery et al., 2012; 22193641, Fadare et al., 2013; 23524907, Mao et al., 2013; 24076775, Katagiri et al., 2012; 22101352, Huang et al., 2014; 25195947, Hussein et al., 2014; 25394778, Bosse et al., 2013; 23702729, Allo et al., 2014; 23887303), breast carcinoma (Zhang et al., 2012; 21889920, Mamo et al., 2012; 21892209, Zhao et al., 2014; 24430365), and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (Lichner et al., 2013; 23416164); ARID1A mutation has been associated with poor outcomes for patients with cholangiocarcinoma (Feng et al., 2021; 33387086, Conci et al., 2020; 32020551, Simbolo et al., 2018; 29740198, Ruzzenente et al., 2016; 26717940). However, prognostic data regarding patient survival are often mixed and conflicting. There are no therapies approved to address the mutation or loss of ARID1A in cancer. However, on the basis of limited clinical and preclinical evidence, ARID1A inactivating mutations may lead to sensitivity to ATR inhibitors such as M6620 and ceralasertib (Williamson et al., 2016; 27958275). In a Phase 2 study of ceralasertib in solid tumors, 2 patients with endometrial carcinoma in the cohort with loss of ARID1A expression achieved CRs on ceralasertib monotherapy; at least 1 of these 2 patients carried an inactivating ARID1A mutation. In contrast, no responses were observed for patients with normal ARID1A expression treated with ceralasertib combined with olaparib (Aggarwal et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 512O). One patient with small cell lung cancer harboring an ARID1A mutation experienced a PR when treated with M6620 combined with topotecan (Thomas et al., 2018; 29252124). In a Phase 1 trial, a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer harboring both an ARID1A mutation and ATM loss treated with single_agent M6620 achieved a CR that was ongoing at 29 months (Yap et al., 2020; 32568634). On the basis of limited preclinical evidence from studies in ovarian cancer, ARID1A inactivation may predict sensitivity to EZH2 inhibitors (Bitler et al., 2015; 25686104, Kim et al., 2015; 26552009), which are under investigation in clinical trials. Other studies have reported that the loss of ARID1A may activate the PI3K_AKT pathway and be linked with sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway (Wiegand et al., 2014; 24559118, Huang et al., 2014; 24336158, Samartzis et al., 2014; 24979463). Patients with ARID1A alterations in advanced or metastatic solid tumors may derive benefit from treatment with anti_PD_1 or anti_PD_L1 immunotherapy (Okamura et al., 2020; 32111729). Loss of ARID1A expression has been associated with chemoresistance to platinum_based therapy for patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma (Yokoyama et al., 2014; 24459582, Katagiri et al., 2012; 22101352) and to 5_fluorouracil in colorectal cancer cell lines (Xie et al., 2014; 24833095).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "ARID1A loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to ATR inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04768296", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02264678", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04657068", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04802174", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02595931", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04514497", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04266912", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03669601", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "CTNNB1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "D32Y", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "D32Y"}}, "Interpretation": "CTNNB1 encodes beta_catenin, a key downstream component of the WNT signaling pathway. Beta_catenin interacts with cadherin to regulate cell_cell adhesion; as a component of the WNT pathway, it also plays a role in development, cell proliferation, and cell differentiation (Kikuchi, 2000; 10679188). CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations, such as observed here, lead to increased beta_catenin protein stability and activation of the WNT pathway, and are considered to be activating (Anastas and Moon, 2013; 23258168, Fukuchi et al., 1998; 9721853, Kikuchi et al., 2003; 12824913, Takahashi et al., 2006; 16523258, Tanaka et al., 2001; 11731417, Abraham et al., 2002; 11943721, Austinat et al., 2008; 18282277, Wu et al., 2003; 12820959, Provost et al., 2005; 15829978, Polakis, 1999; 10072352, Segditsas and Tomlinson, 2006; 17143297, Barth et al., 1997; 9024698, Harada et al., 1999; 10545105, Hsu et al., 1998; 9671490, Breuhahn et al., 2008; 18491352, Soon et al., 2008; 18515740, Tacon et al., 2011; 21212436, Simon and Hammer, 2012; 22266195, Hirotsu et al., 2016; 26850916). CTNNB1 mutations have been reported in 10_18% of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) in general, with one study identifying CTNNB1 as the most frequently mutated oncogene in HCC (Chu and Moon, 2013; 23837144, Kan et al., 2013; 23788652, Nault and Zucman, 2013; 23401783). Some studies have reported that CTNNB1 mutation correlates with favorable prognosis in patients with HCC (Yuan et al., 2013; 23785431, Hsu et al., 2000; 10980116), but another study suggested that beta_catenin nuclear accumulation, which was correlated with CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations, is associated with poor outcome in patients with this tumor type (Nhieu et al., 1999; 10487827). Solid tumors with WNT/beta_catenin pathway alterations, as seen here, were observed to have significantly less T_cell inflammation in one study (Luke et al., 2019; 30635339). Mutation or activation of CTNNB1 signaling has been shown to increase mTOR signaling, promote tumorigenesis, and respond to mTOR inhibition in preclinical studies (Tanwar et al., 2009; 19403928, Tanwar et al., 2011; 21695255, Fujishita et al., 2008; 18768809). Small studies have reported clinical benefit following treatment of everolimus combined with other targeted agents for patients with CTNNB1_mutated hepatocellular carcinoma (Bhoori et al., 2010; 20347502, Janku et al., 2014; 24931142) or endometrial carcinoma (Slomovitz et al., 2015; 25624430). In preclinical studies, CTNNB1 activating mutations have been shown to increase expression of WNT pathway member DKK1, which may promote tumor cell proliferation and immune evasion (Niida et al., 2004; 15378020, Chamorro et al., 2005; 15592430, Kagey and He, 2017; 28574171). A Phase 1 trial of DKK1_targeting antibody DKN_01 in combination with paclitaxel in esophageal cancer reported a PR rate in 2 out of 4 patients and SD rate of in 1 out of 4 patients with CTNNB1 activating mutations, compared with 24% (10/41) PR and 37% (15/41) SD in unselected patients (Kagey et al., 2017; AACR Abstract 369). Multiple preclinical studies in cancer models harboring CTNNB1 mutation or beta_catenin pathway activation have reported activation of the NOTCH pathway and sensitivity to pharmacologic inhibition of NOTCH signaling by gamma_secretase inhibitors (Kwon et al., 2011; 21841793, Arcaroli et al., 2013; 23868008, Shang et al., 2015; 26349011, Kode et al., 2014; 24429522). Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of gamma_secretase inhibitor PF_03084014 have shown high response rates in patients with desmoid tumors, which are driven by activating CTNNB1 mutations in the majority of cases (Kummar et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 10563)(Messersmith et al., 2015; 25231399), suggesting CTNNB1_mutated tumors may be sensitive to gamma_secretase inhibitors. Although WNT pathway inhibitors have been explored preclinically in CTNNB1_mutated cells, clinical data supporting this therapeutic approach are lacking (Zhu et al., 2012; 22964660, Tanwar et al., 2011; 21695255, Kogan et al., 2012; 22356261, Lachenmayer et al., 2012; 22811581). A preclinical study reported that expression of activated mutated CTNNB1 led to resistance to anti_PD_1 therapy in a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Galarreta et al., 2019; 31186238). However, clinical studies have reported conflicting results. In one study of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPI) as treatment for HCC, 7/7 patients with CTNNB1 alterations experienced PD; additionally, patients with tumors with WNT pathway activation (including alterations in CTNNB1, AXIN1, AXIN2, or APC) experienced significantly shorter median PFS (2.0 vs. 7.4 months, HR=9.2) and numerically shorter median OS (9.1 vs. 15.2 months, HR=2.6, p=0.11) compared to those with non_WNT_pathway_altered tumors (Harding et al., 2019; 30373752). In contrast, another clinical study treating HCC with ICPI reported similar PD rates in patients with or without CTNNB1 alterations (2/4 vs. 13/24), as well as no significant differences in median PFS or OS between patients with or without mutations in WNT pathway genes (PFS 2.5 vs 3.1 months, p=0.32; OS 11.5 vs 16.5 months, p=0.57) (von Felden et al., 2021; 33097857). Whether CTNNB1 alterations promote innate resistance to ICPI therefore remains unclear.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Based on clinical and preclinical evidence, tumors with activating CTNNB1 alterations may be sensitive to mTOR inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT03591965", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04337463", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04803318", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03065062", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT01582191", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02321501", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03203525", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "KEAP1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "G477S", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "G477S"}}, "Interpretation": "KEAP1 encodes a substrate adaptor protein that regulates the cellular response to oxidative stress by providing substrate specificity for a CUL3_dependent ubiquitin ligase (Lo and Hannink, 2006; 17046835). KEAP1 exerts anti_tumor effects through negative regulation of NRF2, a transcription factor encoded by NFE2L2 (Wakabayashi et al., 2003; 14517554, Kansanen et al., 2013; 24024136, Hast et al., 2013; 23382044); KEAP1 inactivation promotes cancer progression through NRF2_mediated chemoresistance and cell growth (Kansanen et al., 2013; 24024136, Hast et al., 2013; 23382044). Somatic mutation of KEAP1 occurs in a range of solid tumors, including gastric, hepatocellular, colorectal, and lung cancers (Yoo et al., 2012; 22348534). KEAP1 mutations are rare in hematological malignancies, occurring in fewer than 1% of samples analyzed (COSMIC, 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). In a retrospective analysis of the pan_solid MSKCC dataset, KEAP1 mutation correlated with reduced OS (13.28 vs. 26.53 months) (Xu et al., 2020; 32272498). A study of patients with localized non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) identified pathogenic KEAP1 and NFE2L2 mutations as predictors of local recurrence following radiotherapy but not surgery; limited preclinical data also showed that treatment with a glutaminase inhibitor sensitized KEAP1_mutated NSCLC cells to radiation (Binkley et al., 2020; 33071215). In other preclinical studies, treatment with AKT inhibitors sensitized lung cancer cells harboring KEAP1 or NFE2L2 mutations to both chemotherapy and radiation therapy (Chowdhry et al., 2013; 22964642, Abazeed et al., 2013; 23980093). Mixed clinical data have been reported for the association between KEAP1 mutations and the response to immunotherapy. A pan_cancer study of immunotherapy showed that patients with KEAP1 mutations had shorter OS (10 vs. 20 months) than those without (Chen et al., 2020; 32175433). However, another study across solid tumors showed that KEAP1 mutations were associated with higher tumor mutational burden (TMB) and PD_L1 expression, as well as improved survival outcomes with immunotherapy compared with other treatments (20.0 vs. 11.5 months) (Xu et al., 2020; 32272498). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a study of PD_L1 inhibitors showed that patients with concurrent mutations of STK11 and KEAP1 (n=39) experienced significantly shorter PFS (1.6 vs. 2.5 months, HR=1.5) and OS (4 vs. 11 months, HR=1.9) compared with patients with STK11_ and KEAP1_wildtype tumors (n=210) despite significantly higher TMB in the group harboring STK11 and KEAP1 mutations (median 9.4 vs. 6.1 Muts/Mb) (Arbour et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract MA19.09). Retrospective analyses of patients with NSCLC who received immunotherapy reported reduced OS (p=0.040) for patients harboring KEAP1_ or NFE2L2_mutated tumors (Zhang et al., 2020; 32471565) or STK11_ or KEAP1_mutated tumors (p <0.001) (Shang et al., 2020; WCLC Abstract P75.02) compared with those without. Studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with lung adenocarcinoma showed that coexisting mutations between KEAP1, PBRM1, SMARCA4, STK11, and KRAS were associated with worse OS (Marinelli et al., 2020; 32866624, Ricciuti et al., 2020; WCLC Abstract P14.26). An exploratory analysis of a subset of patients with PD_L1_positive NSCLC treated in the first_line setting with pembrolizumab showed similar ORR, PFS, and OS when comparing patients with STK11 or KEAP1 mutations and those without (Cho et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT084). In addition, preclinical data suggest that KEAP1 inactivation increases tumor demand for glutamine and increases tumor sensitivity to glutaminase inhibitors like telaglenastat (Gwinn et al., 2018; 29316436, Sayin et al., 2017; 28967864, Romero et al., 2017; 28967920). Limited clinical data suggest that KEAP1 mutations may predict improved clinical benefit from combinations of glutaminase inhibitors and anti_PD_1 inhibitors (Skoulidis et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract TPS9627); a Phase 1/2 study of the glutaminase inhibitor telaglenastat (CB_839) plus nivolumab to treat advanced NSCLC reported better clinical benefit rates and median PFS for patients with KEAP1 mutations (75% [3/4] vs. 15% [2/13], 6.4 vs. 3.7 months), KRAS mutations (38% [3/8] vs. 20% [2/10], 4.5 vs. 3.7 months), or KEAP1 and KRAS concurrent mutations (100% [2/2] vs. 13% [1/8], 7.2 vs. 3.7 months) compared with patients without these mutations (Skoulidis et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract TPS9627). The KEAP1 mutation has also been identified as a potential biomarker for sensitivity to combined AKT and TXNRD1 inhibition in lung cancer (Dai et al., 2013; 23824739).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI_H was not detected in a study of 122 hepatocellular (HCC) samples (Goumard et al., 2017; 28871000), although smaller studies have reported MSI in 0_18% of tumors (Gross_Goupil et al., 2003; 12640682, Zhang et al., 2005; 15918185, Chiappini et al., 2004; 14656944, Salvucci et al., 1999; 9926933, Wang et al., 2001; 11494037), and MSI at some level has been detected in a subset of HCC tumors (Goumard et al., 2017; 28871000). The prognostic significance of MSI in HCC has not been determined (PubMed, Jun 2021). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TERT", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "promoter _124C>T", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "promoter _124C>T"}}, "Interpretation": "Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT, or hTERT) is a catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex, which is required to maintain appropriate chromosomal length (Shay et al., 2011; 22015685). Activation of TERT is a hallmark of cancer, being detected in up to 80_90% of malignancies and absent in quiescent cells (Shay et al., 1997; 9282118, Kim et al., 1994; 7605428, Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000; 10647931). Mutations within the promoter region of TERT that confer enhanced TERT promoter activity have been reported in two hotspots, located at _124 bp and _146 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (also termed C228T and C250T, respectively)(Horn et al., 2013; 23348503, Huang et al., 2014; 23348506, Vinagre et al., 2013; 23887589), as well as tandem mutations at positions \u2013124/\u2013125 bp and \u2013138/\u2013139 bp (Horn et al., 2013; 23348503). TERT is one of the most commonly mutated genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with mutations, predominately in the promoter region, reported in 25_59% of cases (Nault et al., 2013; 23887712, Chen et al., 2014; 24866078, Nault et al., 2014; 25123086). TERT promoter mutation has been reported to be the earliest genetic event in HCC development, identified in pre_neoplastic cirrhotic lesions (Nault et al., 2013; 23887712, Nault et al., 2014; 25123086). The frequency of these mutations increases from low_grade pre_malignant tumors such as adenomas and dysplastic nodules to high_grade pre_malignant tumors to carcinoma, suggesting a role for TERT promoter mutation in HCC progression (Nault et al., 2013; 23887712, Nault et al., 2014; 25123086, Pilati et al., 2014; 24735922). A large_scale study reported that TERT promoter alterations are associated with the presence of hepatitis C infection but the absence of hepatitis B infection, and are not associated with prognostic factors such as tumor size, grade, stage, or recurrence in patients with HCC (Chen et al., 2014; 24866078). Therapeutic options for targeting tumors with TERT mutations are limited, although a variety of approaches have been investigated, including immunotherapies using TERT as a tumor_associated antigen and antisense oligonucleotide_ or peptide_based therapies. TERT peptide vaccines showed limited anticancer efficacy in clinical trials (Zanetti et al., 2017; 27245281); however, in one preclinical study, the combination of a TERT peptide vaccine and anti_CTLA_4 therapy suppressed tumor growth (Duperret at al., 2018; 29249395). A Phase 2 study of the TERT inhibitor imetelstat for patients with advanced non_small cell lung cancer reported no improvement in PFS or OS (Chiappori et al., 2015; 25467017).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "03", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "03"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB level associated with lower rates of clinical benefit from treatment with PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors compared with patients with tumors harboring higher TMB levels, based on several studies in multiple solid tumor types (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) harbors a median TMB of 3.6 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 1% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). In an analysis of the TCGA Liver HCC dataset, high TMB was associated with reduced PFS and OS (Shrestha et al., 2018; 30057891). A retrospective study of 128 patients with HCC who underwent curative resection reported decreased recurrence_free survival for patients with high TMB (>4.8 Muts/Mb) compared to those with low TMB (\u22644.8 Muts/Mb) measured in tissue samples (Cai et al., 2020; 31995247). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, higher TMB has been reported to be associated with increased ORR and OS from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). Higher TMB was found to be significantly associated with improved OS upon immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment for patients with 9 types of advanced tumors (Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254). Analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy, compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386). However, the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors found significant improvement in ORR for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (based on this assay or others) compared to those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb, in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types; similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915).
