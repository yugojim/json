FGFR3 has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210) and may be biologically relevant in this context (Zack et al., 2013; 24071852, Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). The frequency of FGFR3 amplification in neuroendocrine tumors has not been evaluated (cBioPortal, PubMed, Jan 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of FGFR3 alteration in neuroendocrine tumors are limited (PubMed, Jan 2021). Alterations that activate FGFR3 may predict sensitivity to selective FGFR kinase inhibitors, including erdafitinib (Loriot et al., 2019; 31340094, Tabernero et al., 2015; 26324363, Karkera et al., 2017; 28416604, Park et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 4117), pemigatinib (Necchi et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 900P), infigratinib (Pal et al., 2018; 29848605, Pal et al., 2020; 32208524), rogaratinib (Schuler et al., 2019; 31405822), Debio 1347 (Nakanishi et al., 2015; 25589496, Voss et al., 2019; 30745300), and derazantinib (Papadopoulos et al., 2017; 28972963); multikinase inhibitors such as pazopanib (Bellmunt et al., 2018; 30220708, Palma et al., 2015; 25766722) and ponatinib (Gozgit et al., 2012; 22238366, Liao et al., 2013; 23786770); and vofatamab, an antibody targeting FGFR3 (Bellmunt et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 4534, Necchi et al., 2019; ASCO GU Abstract 409, Siefker_Radtke et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 4511). In the context of FGFR3 alterations, FGFR inhibitors, such as erdafitinib (Loriot et al., 2019; 31340094), pemigatinib (Necchi et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 900P), infigratinib (Pal et al., 2018; 29848605), rogaratinib (Schuler et al., 2019; 31405822), and Debio 1347 (Voss et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 2500), have predominantly been studied in the context of urothelial carcinoma, resulting in ORRs of 25_40% and DCRs of 64_80%. Clinical benefit has been reported in patients with gliomas harboring FGFR3 fusions treated in a Phase 1 trial of erdafitinib (Tabernero et al., 2015; 26324363, Di Stefano et al., 2015; 25609060), and a prolonged SD has been observed in a case study treated with Debio 1347 (Sait et al., 2021; 34250399). For infigratinib, activity against non_urothelial tumors harboring FGFR3 alterations are limited (Nogova et al., 2017; 27870574), with responses reported in individuals with an FGFR3_amplified and _rearranged glioma or FGFR3_mutated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with co_occurring FGF amplifications (Slosberg et al., 2018; 29765547).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "FGFR inhibitors may be relevant in tumors with alterations that activate FGFR3.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04803318", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03564691", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04008797", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04042116", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04565275", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02272998", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04729348", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03950609", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03290079", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02856425", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "KEAP1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "S486fs*15", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "S486fs*15"}}, "Interpretation": "KEAP1 encodes a substrate adaptor protein that regulates the cellular response to oxidative stress by providing substrate specificity for a CUL3_dependent ubiquitin ligase (Lo and Hannink, 2006; 17046835). KEAP1 exerts anti_tumor effects through negative regulation of NRF2, a transcription factor encoded by NFE2L2 (Wakabayashi et al., 2003; 14517554, Kansanen et al., 2013; 24024136, Hast et al., 2013; 23382044); KEAP1 inactivation promotes cancer progression through NRF2_mediated chemoresistance and cell growth (Kansanen et al., 2013; 24024136, Hast et al., 2013; 23382044). Somatic mutation of KEAP1 occurs in a range of solid tumors, including gastric, hepatocellular, colorectal, and lung cancers (Yoo et al., 2012; 22348534). KEAP1 mutations are rare in hematological malignancies, occurring in fewer than 1% of samples analyzed (COSMIC, 2021)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). In a retrospective analysis of the pan_solid MSKCC dataset, KEAP1 mutation correlated with reduced OS (13.28 vs. 26.53 months) (Xu et al., 2020; 32272498). A study of patients with localized non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) identified pathogenic KEAP1 and NFE2L2 mutations as predictors of local recurrence following radiotherapy but not surgery; limited preclinical data also showed that treatment with a glutaminase inhibitor sensitized KEAP1_mutated NSCLC cells to radiation (Binkley et al., 2020; 33071215). In other preclinical studies, treatment with AKT inhibitors sensitized lung cancer cells harboring KEAP1 or NFE2L2 mutations to both chemotherapy and radiation therapy (Chowdhry et al., 2013; 22964642, Abazeed et al., 2013; 23980093). Mixed clinical data have been reported for the association between KEAP1 mutations and the response to immunotherapy. A pan_cancer study of immunotherapy showed that patients with KEAP1 mutations had shorter OS (10 vs. 20 months) than those without (Chen et al., 2020; 32175433). However, another study across solid tumors showed that KEAP1 mutations were associated with higher tumor mutational burden (TMB) and PD_L1 expression, as well as improved survival outcomes with immunotherapy compared with other treatments (20.0 vs. 11.5 months) (Xu et al., 2020; 32272498). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a study of PD_L1 inhibitors showed that patients with concurrent mutations of STK11 and KEAP1 (n=39) experienced significantly shorter PFS (1.6 vs. 2.5 months, HR=1.5) and OS (4 vs. 11 months, HR=1.9) compared with patients with STK11_ and KEAP1_wildtype tumors (n=210) despite significantly higher TMB in the group harboring STK11 and KEAP1 mutations (median 9.4 vs. 6.1 Muts/Mb) (Arbour et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract MA19.09). Retrospective analyses of patients with NSCLC who received immunotherapy reported reduced OS (p=0.040) for patients harboring KEAP1_ or NFE2L2_mutated tumors (Zhang et al., 2020; 32471565) or STK11_ or KEAP1_mutated tumors (p <0.001) (Shang et al., 2020; WCLC Abstract P75.02) compared with those without. Studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with lung adenocarcinoma showed that coexisting mutations between KEAP1, PBRM1, SMARCA4, STK11, and KRAS were associated with worse OS (Marinelli et al., 2020; 32866624, Ricciuti et al., 2020; WCLC Abstract P14.26). An exploratory analysis of a subset of patients with PD_L1_positive NSCLC treated in the first_line setting with pembrolizumab showed similar ORR, PFS, and OS when comparing patients with STK11 or KEAP1 mutations and those without (Cho et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT084). In addition, preclinical data suggest that KEAP1 inactivation increases tumor demand for glutamine and increases tumor sensitivity to glutaminase inhibitors like telaglenastat (Gwinn et al., 2018; 29316436, Sayin et al., 2017; 28967864, Romero et al., 2017; 28967920). Limited clinical data suggest that KEAP1 mutations may predict improved clinical benefit from combinations of glutaminase inhibitors and anti_PD_1 inhibitors (Skoulidis et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract TPS9627); a Phase 1/2 study of the glutaminase inhibitor telaglenastat (CB_839) plus nivolumab to treat advanced NSCLC reported better clinical benefit rates and median PFS for patients with KEAP1 mutations (75% [3/4] vs. 15% [2/13], 6.4 vs. 3.7 months), KRAS mutations (38% [3/8] vs. 20% [2/10], 4.5 vs. 3.7 months), or KEAP1 and KRAS concurrent mutations (100% [2/2] vs. 13% [1/8], 7.2 vs. 3.7 months) compared with patients without these mutations (Skoulidis et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract TPS9627). The KEAP1 mutation has also been identified as a potential biomarker for sensitivity to combined AKT and TXNRD1 inhibition in lung cancer (Dai et al., 2013; 23824739).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "KEAP1 inactivation may predict sensitivity to glutaminase inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": {"nctId": "NCT03872427", "Include": "true"}}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "KIT", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "true", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "KIT (also called c_KIT) encodes a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor that, upon ligand binding and dimerization, activates the PI3K_AKT and RAS_MAPK signaling pathways (Linnekin, 1999; 10582339). KIT aberrations, including point mutations, translocations, amplification, and overexpression, have been associated with various malignancies, and KIT is considered an oncoprotein (Fletcher, 2004; 15175998). KIT has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210) and may be biologically relevant in this context (Zack et al., 2013; 24071852, Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). KIT alterations were identified in 7% (7/98) of small cell undifferentiated lung cancer cases (Ross et al., 2014; 24978188). KIT protein expression has been reported in 36_83% of SCLC samples (Xuan et al., 2013; 23965952, Lu et al., 2012; 22807968, L\u00f3pez_Martin et al., 2007; 17420067). KIT protein expression has been observed in 17_77% of lung large cell neuroendocrine cancers (Araki et al., 2003; 12711118, Pelosi et al., 2004; 15375659, Went et al., 2004; 15542802, Rossi et al., 2005; 16314638, Ivoda et al., 2011; 22977617). KIT activating mutations have been reported in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (Knosel et al., 2012; 22160160). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of KIT alteration in neuroendocrine tumors are limited (PubMed, Apr 2021). On the basis of clinical evidence, primarily in GIST, AML, and systemic mastocytosis, KIT activating alterations are associated with sensitivity to KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitors including imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib, dasatinib, nilotinib, pazopanib, regorafenib, ponatinib, midostaurin, avapritinib, and ripretinib (Heinrich et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 10506, Heinrich et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 11011, DeAngelo et al., 2017; ASH Abstract 2, Evans et al., 2017; 29093181, Abbaspour Babaei et al., 2016; 27536065, Ramaswamy et al., 2016; 27563456, Demetri et al., 2013; 23177515, Gotlib et al., 2016; 27355533, Jawhar et al., 2017; 28424161, Xu et al., 2014; 25031773, Gotlib et al., 2005; 15972446, George et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 11511). The use of mTOR inhibitors as an alternative therapeutic strategy has demonstrated limited success in KIT_mutated, imatinib_resistant melanoma, with 1 PR and 3 SD observed for 4 patients treated with everolimus (Si et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract 8562, Si et al., 2012; 22162580). However, no responses were observed for 10 patients with mastocytosis following everolimus monotherapy, with 8/10 patients harboring the KIT D816V mutation (Parikh et al., 2010; 20038218). The role of KIT amplification as a biomarker for response to mTOR inhibitors has not been investigated (PubMed, Mar 2021).

In the context of CML, a Phase 3 clinical trial of Ph+ patients treated with imatinib or nilotinib (300 mg or 400 mg) reported progression_free survival (PFS) rates of 93% and 97_98% and overall survival (OS) rates of 93% and 94_97%, respectively, at 4 years (Hughes et al., 2014; 24335106).

PDGFR aberrations, including point mutations, translocations, amplification, and/or overexpression, have been associated with various malignancies (Fletcher, 2004; 15175998). Amplification of PDGFRA, frequently occurring with amplification of the genes KDR and KIT, has been associated with increased PDGFRA expression (Burford et al., 2013; 23990986, Flavahan et al., 2016; 26700815, Roszik et al., 2016; 26787600, Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251) and poor prognosis (Burford et al., 2013; 23990986, Koschmann et al., 2016; 27582545, Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035, Puget et al., 2012; 22389665) in some subtypes of glioma.

High bTMB levels were not detected in this sample. It is unclear whether the bTMB levels in this sample would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Depending on the clinical context, TMB testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. Average bTMB levels in solid tumors other than NSCLC have not been evaluated (cBioPortal, COSMIC, PubMed, Mar 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). In 1 retrospective study of patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors not treated with immunotherapy, tumor mutational burden (TMB)_high (\u226510 Muts/Mb) was not correlated with any significant difference in OS compared with TMB_low (\u2264 10 Muts/Mb) measured in tissue samples (10.4 vs. 6.4 months, adjusted HR = 0.83) (Shao et al., 2020; 33119110). The impact of TMB on the prognosis and clinicopathological features of lung neuroendocrine cancers is unclear; large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) cases with small cell lung cancer_like molecular features were reported to have significantly higher proliferative activity, as well as a trend toward better clinical benefit from treatment with chemotherapy, than non_small cell lung cancer_like tumors, but the average TMB was not significantly different between the two subsets of LCNEC (Rekhtman et al., 2016; 26960398). MCPyV_negative Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), associated with higher TMB, has been reported to have a higher number of predicted tumor neoantigens and a significantly higher UV mutation signature than MCPyV_positive MCC (Harms et al., 2015; 26238782, Goh et al., 2016; 26655088). Within MCPyV_negative MCC tumors, the mutational burden has been reported to be significantly higher in PD_L1_positive tumors (more than 1% positive tumor and macrophage cells by immunohistochemistry) than in PD_L1_negative tumors (Wong et al., 2015; 26627015). On the basis of clinical evidence in NSCLC and HSNCC, increased bTMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511) and anti_PD_1 (Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074) therapies. In NSCLC, multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 to 16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). In HNSCC, a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "KDR", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "true", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "KDR encodes vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) family. It is a receptor tyrosine kinase that transmits signals from VEGFA and is involved in both tumor angiogenesis and vasculogenesis during development (Takahashi, 2011; 22130231). KDR amplification has been reported in many tumor types and may be oncogenic (Takahashi, 2011; 22130231). KDR mutation has been reported in 4.9% of lung small cell carcinoma, 4.8% of pancreatic carcinoid_endocrine tumor, 5.0% (3/60) of lung large cell carcinoma, and 2.3% of lung carcinoid_endocrine tumor samples analyzed in COSMIC, but was not detected in analyzed small cell carcinoma of the cervix, ovary, or urinary tract or carcinoid_endocrine tumors of the large intestine (COSMIC, Apr 2021)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). A study of pulmonary carcinoids and neuroendocrine carcinomas found an inverse correlation of KDR expression and tumor malignancy (Mairinger et al., 2014; 24959299). Increased expression of KDR has been detected in various types of neuroendocrine tumors, including lung neuroendocrine cell hyperplasias and pancreatic endocrine tumors (von Marschall et al., 2003; 12644537, Gilbert et al., 2013; 23211371, Sartelet et al., 2004; 15492987, Fakhari et al., 2002; 11912515, Langer et al., 2000; 10842244). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of KDR alterations in neuroendocrine or carcinoid carcinomas are limited (PubMed, May 2021). On the basis of clinical benefit for patients with ccRCC (Beuselinck et al., 2018; 29095068, Song et al., 2015; 26228213, Dornbusch et al., 2013; 24086736, Terakawa et al., 2013; 21478036, You et al., 2015; 24710685) and a patient with breast angiosarcoma (Silva et al., 2015; 25639617), high VEGFR_2 expression has been associated with sensitivity to sunitinib. However, because data supporting concordance between VEGFR_2 expression and KDR genomic biomarkers are limited, it is unclear whether these therapeutic strategies would be beneficial in this case. On the basis of extensive clinical evidence across multiple tumor types, expression of plasma or tumor VEGFR_1 or VEGFR_2 has not been established as a reliable biomarker to predict response to the VEGFA_targeted agent bevacizumab (Baumgarten et al., 2016; 26627848, Sathornsumetee et al., 2008; 18182667, Olafson et al., 2019; 31582283, Nishikawa et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 2023, Wick et al., 2013; WCN Abstract 1207, Duda et al., 2010; 20484123, Stremitzer et al., 2016; 27535973, Weickhardt et al., 2015; 26125443, Kopetz et al., 2009; 20008624, Miles et al., 2013; 23422754, Fountzilas et al., 2011; 21868552, Gianni et al., 2013; 23569311, S\u00e1nchez_Rovira et al., 2013; 23397155, Cameron et al., 2013; 23932548, Mok et al., 2014; 24807156, An et al., 2014; 24577128, Bais et al., 2017; 29059426, Cohen et al., 2009; 19201650, Van Cutsem et al., 2011; EMCC Abstract 803, Van Cutsem et al., 2012; 22565005, Lee et al., 2018; 29941486, Xu et al., 2009; 19826039, Heist et al., 2014; 25605928).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Cannot Be Determined", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Cannot Be Determined"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI_high (MSI_H) has been observed at high frequency in endometrial cancers (14_33%)(Santin et al., ASCO 2016; Abstract 414, Zighelboim et al., 2007; 17513808, Hampel et al., 2006; 16885385, Stelloo et al., 2016; 27006490, Kanopiene et al., 2014; 25458958, Black et al., 2006; 16549821, Nout et al., 2012; 22609107, Steinbakk et al., 2011; 21547578, Bilbao et al., 2010; 20005452), colorectal cancers (CRCs; 10_15%)(Guastadisegni et al., 2010; 20627535, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 22810696, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), and gastric cancers (12_35%)(Hiyama et al., 2004; 15209621, Wu et al., 1998; 9537253, dos Santos et al., 1996; 8536886, Fang et al., 2013; 23555086) and at lower frequencies in many other tumor types, including esophageal (Hall et al., 2016; ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancer Symposium Abstract 528, Farris et al., 2011; 21422910), small bowel (Gingras et al., 2015; AACR Pancreatic Cancer Abstract PR06, Agaramet al., 2010; 20395525, Ruemmele et al., 2009; 19252434, Planck et al., 2003; 12627520, Hibi et al., 1995; 7775257, Muneyuki et al., 2000; 11117578), hepatobiliary (Zhang et al., 2005; 15918185, Chiappini et al., 2004; 14656944, Suto et al., 2001; 11223838, Momoi et al., 2001; 11580146, Liengswangwong et al., 2003; 14506736, Moy et al., 2015; 25680569, Yoshida et al., 2000; 11063221), prostate (Cheng et al., 2016; Genitourinary Cancers Symposium Abstract 251, Pritchard et al., 2014; 25255306, Azzouzi et al., 2007; 17233803, Burger et al., 2006; 16924473), and urinary tract carcinomas (Harper et al., 2015; USCAP Abstract 905, Bai et al., 2013; 23690119, Giedl et al., 2014; 25319978, Yamamoto et al., 2006; 16675567). One study reported higher incidence of MSI_H in high grade gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine cancers compared to low grade tumors (4% vs 0%)(Puccini et al., 2020; 32883742). Although MSI is rare in small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) (Arnason et al., 2011; 22129180, Arnold et al., 2007; 17278096, Kidd et al., 2005; 15599934), a study of 89 gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas (MANECs) reported MSI in 11 (12%) samples, including seven intestinal and four gastric (Sahnane et al., 2015; 25465415). In one study, MSI_H status was associated with a positive prognostic effect in patients with gastric cancer treated with surgery alone and a negative predictive effect in patients treated with chemotherapy (Smyth et al., 2015; ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium Abstract 62). Data regarding the role of MSI_H on prognosis and survival in endometrial cancer are conflicting (Zighelboim et al., 2007; 17513808, Kanopiene et al., 2014; 25458958, Bilbao_Sieyro et al., 2014; 25026289, Mackay et al., 2010; 20304627, Steinbakk et al., 2011; 21547578, Arabi et al., 2009; 19275958, Black et al., 2006; 16549821). However, studies specifically analyzing early stage endometrial cancer have reported a correlation between MSI_H and decreased survival (Stelloo et al., 2016; 27006490, Mackay et al., 2010; 20304627, Nout et al., 2012; 22609107, Bilbao et al., 2010; 20005452), thereby suggesting that MSI_H predicts for poor prognosis in this subset of endometrial tumors. On the basis of prospective clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD_1_targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143) and PD_L1_targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92). As the MSI status of this tumor is unknown, the relevance of these therapeutic approaches is unclear. While approximately 80% of MSI_H tumors arise due to somatic inactivation of an MMR pathway protein, about 20% arise due to germline mutations in one of the MMR genes (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942), which are associated with a condition known as Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC) (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756). Lynch syndrome leads to an increased risk of colorectal, endometrial, gastric, and other cancers (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756, Pande et al., 2012; 22714864, Kastrinos and Syngal, 2007; 17920897) and has an estimated prevalence in the general population ranging from 1:600 to 1:2000 (Silva et al., 2009; 19466295, Sehgal et al., 2014; 24978665, de la Chapelle et al., 2005; 16136383). Therefore, in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": [{"Name": "R213*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "R213*"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 mutation has been reported in a number of carcinoid_endocrine cases, including 52% (15/29) of stomach, 10% of large intestine, 4% of lung, 7% of pancreatic, and 3% of small intestine origin; TP53 mutations were also observed in 19% of Merkel cell carcinomas, 60_71% (6/10_5/7) of prostate small cell carcinomas, 47% of cervical endocrine tumors, and 70% of small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) (COSMIC, Jan 2021)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878, Fernandez_Cuesta et al., 2014; 24670920, Higaki_Mori et al., 2012; 22795182, Rodig et al., 2012; 23114601, Takahashi et al., 1991; 1656362, Chen et al., 2012; 22389383, Wistuba et al., 1999; 9889022, Tan et al., 2014; 24323898, Yachida et al., 2012; 22251937). High p53 expression has been reported to be associated with poor prognosis in gastric neuroendocrine and gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (Liu et al., 2013; 23534765, Safatle_Ribeiro et al., 2007; 17206073). The frequency of TP53 mutation or loss and altered p53 levels in neuroendocrine lung tumors has been correlated with the degree of malignancy, as TP53 alterations are more frequent in the most malignant tumor types, including SCLC and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (Kobayashi et al., 2004; 15072592, Przygodzki et al., 1996; 8623922, Onuki et al., 1999; 10091733). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% (17/176) and SDs in 53.4% (94/176) of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21.1% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12.1% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wild_type (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 31.9% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73.4% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 42.9% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76.2% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24.0% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71.4% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75.0% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Additionally, the combination of a CHK1 inhibitor and irinotecan reportedly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival in a TP53_mutated, but not TP53_wild_type, breast cancer xenotransplant mouse model (Ma et al., 2012; 22446188). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. Mutations in TP53 or RB1 are characteristic of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) (NCCN Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors, v1.2021) (Pavel et al., 2020; 32272208, Baudin et al., 2021; 33482246, Rindi et al., 2018; 30140036, Nagtegaal et al., 2020; 31433515). One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}, {"Name": "splice site 783_2A>C", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "splice site 783_2A>C"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675).

Mutations in TP53 or RB1 are characteristic of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) (NCCN Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors, v1.2021) (Pavel et al., 2020; 32272208, Baudin et al., 2021; 33482246, Rindi et al., 2018; 30140036, Nagtegaal et al., 2020; 31433515). One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Fraction", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "23", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "23"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor fraction provides an estimate of the percentage of ctDNA present in a cell_free DNA (cfDNA) sample. The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with high tumor fraction values have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus higher sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at a lower risk of false negative results (Li et al., 2021; AACR Abstract 2231). However, if tumor fraction is not detected as high, it does not exclude the presence of disease burden or compromise the confidence of reported alterations. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels. In the research setting, changes in tumor fraction estimates have been associated with treatment duration and clinical response and may be a useful indicator for future cancer management (Bronkhorst
