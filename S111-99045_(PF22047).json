In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). Amplification of EGFR has been associated with increased expression of EGFR mRNA and protein in several cancer types (Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Bhargava et al., 2005; 15920544, Yang et al., 2012; 22490401). Disruption of the EGFR C_terminal region through deletion (Cho et al., 2011; 22001862, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Pines et al., 2010; 20676128), truncation (Cho et al., 2011; 22001862, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Wang et al., 2007; 17643422), splicing errors (Cho et al., 2011; 22001862, Wang et al., 2007; 17643422), or gene fusion (Frattini et al., 2013; 23917401, FMI_Konduri et al., 2016; 27102076), has been demonstrated to be activating and is likely to be oncogenic. These mutations have been shown to cause cellular transformation and tumor formation and to be sensitive to EGFR_targeting therapies, including erlotinib, lapatinib, and cetuximab (Cho et al., 2011; 22001862, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Pines et al., 2010; 20676128, Frattini et al., 2013; 23917401, FMI_Konduri et al., 2016; 27102076). One or more of the alterations observed here are predicted to be activating. Across several genomic studies of CNS tumors, EGFR amplification has been reported in 16.9% of anaplastic astrocytomas, and 39.7% of glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs)(Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031, Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509). EGFR alterations have been reported in 13.2% of anaplastic astrocytomas, 5.3_15.9% of glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs), and 0% of pilocytic astrocytomas in several genomic studies of CNS tumors (cbio_Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031, cbio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, cbio_Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, cbio_Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509). In GBMs, Missense mutations in the EGFR extracellular domain have been found in 10_15% of cases and approximately half have a low_level amplification of the mutated allele (Lee et al., 2006; 17177598, Vivanco et al., 2012; 22588883). In a study of IDH_wildtype GBM samples, EGFR alterations were detected in 50% (117/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed, including 41% (95/232) with a co_occurring EGFR amplification and mutation, 26% (61/232) with an EGFR domain truncation event, such as EGFRvIII, and 2.2% (5/232) with an EGFR fusion event (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). No definitive correlation has been identified between EGFR amplification and length of survival in patients with GBM (Srividya et al., 2010; 20702468, Das et al., 2011; 20888234); however, EGFR amplification has been associated with prolonged survival in patients over the age of 60 with GBM (Smith et al., 2001; 11504770). In multiple glioblastoma (GBM) studies, the presence of EGFRvIII has not predicted clinical benefit from first_generation EGFR TKIs such as erlotinib (Van den Bent et al., 2009; 19204207, Haas_Kogen et al., 2005; 15956649, Brown et al., 2008; 18955445, Preusser et al., 2008; 18458820, Wen et al., 2014; 24470557, Gallego et al., 2013; 24352766) or gefitinib (Rich et al. 2004; 14638850, Uhm et al., 2011; 20510539, Preusser et al., 2008; 18458820). However, case reports have described patients with EGFRvIII_positive GBM responding to erlotinib (Doyle et al., 2018; 30410775, D Alessandris et al., 2013; 23132371, Custodio and Perez_Segura, 2010; 20462843, D Alessandris et al., 2018; 30306271). In a retrospective study of patients with GBM treated with erlotinib or gefitinib, co_expression of EGFRvIII with PTEN protein was the strongest predictor of response (P<0.001)(Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176), suggesting that activity in this setting is dependent on PTEN status (Mellinghoff et al., 2007; 17255257, Arif et al., 2018; 29492119). However, a prospective Phase 2 trial testing erlotinib monotherapy for patients with EGFRvIII and PTEN_positive recurrent glioblastoma reported minimal efficacy and was terminated (Gallego et al., 2013; 24352766). The second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib have shown minimal efficacy for patients with EGFRvIII glioblastoma (GBM)(Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Alshami et al., 2015; 26423602, Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). A Phase 1/2 study of afatinib, temozolomide, or the combination for patients with GBM reported clinical benefit, including for patients with EGFRvIII; however, temozolomide alone and in combination exhibited better responses than afatinib monotherapy (Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Alshami et al., 2015; 26423602). A Phase 2 trial of dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified GBM reported a DCR of 26% (5/19) among patients with EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII; however, the trial failed to meet its primary endpoint of 6_month PFS (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464). A retrospective biomarker analysis of another Phase 2 study of dacomitinib for patients with GBM found no association between EGFRvIII and clinical benefit (Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). A patient with multiple glioblastoma (GBM) tumors, one of which harbored EGFRvIII, experienced progression of the EGFRvIII_positive tumor during treatment with osimertinib (Makhlin et al., 2019; 31769726). Clinical studies of the second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified gliomas have shown limited efficacy (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Blumenthal et al., 2016; 27531351); however, a small subset of patients has experienced clinical benefit (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). Multiple studies have failed to find a positive association between increased EGFR expression and clinical benefit from erlotinib or gefitinib for patients with glioblastoma (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176, Franceschi et al., 2007; 17353924, Chakravarti et al., 2013; 23182702, Hegi et al., 2011; 21471286, Rich et al. 2004; 14638850). There are conflicting data on the efficacy of anti_EGFR antibodies for the treatment of EGFR_amplified tumors. A meta_analysis of colorectal cancer patients treated with second_line or higher cetuximab or panitumumab observed an association between EGFR copy number gain and increased OS and PFS (Jiang et al., 2013; 23441167). However, studies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cancer found either no association or a negative association between EGFR copy number gain and survival after treatment with first_line cetuximab or panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy (Licitra et al., 2011; 21048039, Smyth et al., 2020; 33199443). The Phase 3 INTELLANCE trial of depatuxizumab mafodotin (ABT_414), an EGFR_targeted antibody_drug conjugate with a toxic payload, in patients with EGFR_amplified glioblastoma (GBM) was stopped for futility. Interim analysis demonstrated improved median PFS (mPFS) of ABT_414 monotherapy compared with placebo (HR=0.84); however, no OS benefit was observed (HR=1.01). Improved mPFS was also observed in patients harboring EGFRvIII (HR=0.73) but without an OS improvement (HR=0.95) (Lassman et al., 2019; Neuro_Oncology Abstract ACTR_21). The Phase 2 INTELLANCE trial demonstrated clinical benefit for EGFR_amplified GBM for the combination of ABT_414, temozolomide, and radiotherapy (HR=0.66, p=0.017), but there was no evidence of efficacy for ABT_414 monotherapy (HR=1.04, p=0.83)(Bent et al., 2020; 31747009). The presence of EGFR gene amplification or TERT promoter mutations are indicative of diffuse astrocytic glioma with molecular features of glioblastoma, WHO grade 4 in IDH1/2_wildtype tumors (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021) (Louis et al., 2021; 34185076).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

Panitumumab has shown efficacy as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy for patients with KRAS_wildtype colorectal cancer (Douillard et al., 2014; 24718886, Price et al., 2014; 24739896, Van Cutsem et al., 2007; 17470858) and has been investigated in a variety of other tumor types. For patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), data are conflicting; some trials of panitumumab in various lines and with different chemotherapy combinations have shown modest benefit (Vermorken et al., 2013; 23746666, Wirth et al., 2010; 19892746, Siano et al., 2017; 28592616) and others have reported no benefit (Mesia et al., 2015; 25596660, Giralt et al., 2015; 25596659, Siu et al., 2016; 27930762). A Phase 3 study of chemotherapy with or without panitumumab for patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancer was terminated for futility (Waddell et al., 2013; 23594787). Trials in a variety of tumor types have failed to show significant benefit for patients, including non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Crawford et al., 2013; 24389433, Shuette et al., 2015; 26094080); biliary tract cancers, including cholangiocarcinoma (Leone et al., 2016; 26540314, Vogel et al., 2018; 29413685); and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (Rowinsky et al., 2004; 15210739). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Cetuximab", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets EGFR.

In preclinical trials, cetuximab, matuzumab, and panitumumab were reported to be ineffective at blocking EGFR dimerization and activation in GBM cells expressing EGFR extracellular domain mutations (Gajadhar et al., 2012; 22232519). However, another study demonstrated that in patients with GBM harboring EGFR amplification but lacking expression of the EGFRvIII variant, treatment with cetuximab resulted in significantly better progression_free survival (PFS) and numerical (although not statistically significant) improvement in overall survival (OS) (Lv et al., 2012; 22752145). A Phase 3 trial of combined cetuximab and platinum/5_FU in patients with HNSCC demonstrated improved response compared to platinum/5_FU alone, but EGFR amplification was not shown to predict response to this treatment (Licitra et al., 2011; 21048039). A Phase 3 study of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma did not report any improved outcome in patients treated with a combination of cetuximab plus gemcitabine vs gemcitabine alone (Philip et al., 2010; 20606093). In a Phase 1/2 trial of 36 patients with metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with cetuximab in combination with doxorubicin, stable disease was reported in approximately 63% of patients (Slovin et al., 2009; 19815486). A Phase 1 study of the combination therapy of cetuximab, erlotinib, and bevacizumab reported stable disease in 21% (7/34) of patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Falchook et al., 2013; 23435217). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT03618667", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04720976", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02800486", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02861898", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03783403", "Include": "true"}]}}, {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "EGFR encodes the epidermal growth factor receptor, which belongs to a class of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases.

However, case reports have described patients with EGFRvIII_positive GBM responding to erlotinib (Doyle et al., 2018; 30410775, D Alessandris et al., 2013; 23132371, Custodio and Perez_Segura, 2010; 20462843, D Alessandris et al., 2018; 30306271).

A retrospective biomarker analysis of another Phase 2 study of dacomitinib for patients with GBM found no association between EGFRvIII and clinical benefit (Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). A patient with multiple glioblastoma (GBM) tumors, one of which harbored EGFRvIII, experienced progression of the EGFRvIII_positive tumor during treatment with osimertinib (Makhlin et al., 2019; 31769726). Clinical studies of the second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified gliomas have shown limited efficacy (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Blumenthal et al., 2016; 27531351); however, a small subset of patients has experienced clinical benefit (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). Multiple studies have failed to find a positive association between increased EGFR expression and clinical benefit from erlotinib or gefitinib for patients with glioblastoma (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176, Franceschi et al., 2007; 17353924, Chakravarti et al., 2013; 23182702, Hegi et al., 2011; 21471286, Rich et al. 2004; 14638850). There are conflicting data on the efficacy of anti_EGFR antibodies for the treatment of EGFR_amplified tumors. A meta_analysis of colorectal cancer patients treated with second_line or higher cetuximab or panitumumab observed an association between EGFR copy number gain and increased OS and PFS (Jiang et al., 2013; 23441167). However, studies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cancer found either no association or a negative association between EGFR copy number gain and survival after treatment with first_line cetuximab or panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy (Licitra et al., 2011; 21048039, Smyth et al., 2020; 33199443). The Phase 3 INTELLANCE trial of depatuxizumab mafodotin (ABT_414), an EGFR_targeted antibody_drug conjugate with a toxic payload, in patients with EGFR_amplified glioblastoma (GBM) was stopped for futility. Interim analysis demonstrated improved median PFS (mPFS) of ABT_414 monotherapy compared with placebo (HR=0.84); however, no OS benefit was observed (HR=1.01). Improved mPFS was also observed in patients harboring EGFRvIII (HR=0.73) but without an OS improvement (HR=0.95) (Lassman et al., 2019; Neuro_Oncology Abstract ACTR_21). The Phase 2 INTELLANCE trial demonstrated clinical benefit for EGFR_amplified GBM for the combination of ABT_414, temozolomide, and radiotherapy (HR=0.66, p=0.017), but there was no evidence of efficacy for ABT_414 monotherapy (HR=1.04, p=0.83)(Bent et al., 2020; 31747009). The presence of EGFR gene amplification or TERT promoter mutations are indicative of diffuse astrocytic glioma with molecular features of glioblastoma, WHO grade 4 in IDH1/2_wildtype tumors (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021) (Louis et al., 2021; 34185076).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

Panitumumab has shown efficacy as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy for patients with KRAS_wildtype colorectal cancer (Douillard et al., 2014; 24718886, Price et al., 2014; 24739896, Van Cutsem et al., 2007; 17470858) and has been investigated in a variety of other tumor types. For patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), data are conflicting; some trials of panitumumab in various lines and with different chemotherapy combinations have shown modest benefit (Vermorken et al., 2013; 23746666, Wirth et al., 2010; 19892746, Siano et al., 2017; 28592616) and others have reported no benefit (Mesia et al., 2015; 25596660, Giralt et al., 2015; 25596659, Siu et al., 2016; 27930762). A Phase 3 study of chemotherapy with or without panitumumab for patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancer was terminated for futility (Waddell et al., 2013; 23594787).

In preclinical trials, cetuximab, matuzumab, and panitumumab were reported to be ineffective at blocking EGFR dimerization and activation in GBM cells expressing EGFR extracellular domain mutations (Gajadhar et al., 2012; 22232519). However, another study demonstrated that in patients with GBM harboring EGFR amplification but lacking expression of the EGFRvIII variant, treatment with cetuximab resulted in significantly better progression_free survival (PFS) and numerical (although not statistically significant) improvement in overall survival (OS) (Lv et al., 2012; 22752145). A Phase 3 trial of combined cetuximab and platinum/5_FU in patients with HNSCC demonstrated improved response compared to platinum/5_FU alone, but EGFR amplification was not shown to predict response to this treatment (Licitra et al., 2011; 21048039). A Phase 3 study of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma did not report any improved outcome in patients treated with a combination of cetuximab plus gemcitabine vs gemcitabine alone (Philip et al., 2010; 20606093). In a Phase 1/2 trial of 36 patients with metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with cetuximab in combination with doxorubicin, stable disease was reported in approximately 63% of patients (Slovin et al., 2009; 19815486).

The PI3K pathway is involved in cell signaling that regulates a number of critical cellular functions, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival (Samuels et al., 2005; 15950905, Engelman, 2009; 19629070). PIK3CA P104L, E110del, E453del and G914R have been reported to increase PI3K activity and have been reported in individuals with megalencephaly syndromes, suggesting they promote cell growth (Riviere et al., 2012; 22729224). In addition, missense mutations of E453 and a short deletion including this residue have been shown to be activating (Rudd et al., 2011; 21266528, Hucthagowder et al., 2017; 27307077, Kuentz et al., 2017; 28151489). PIK3CA alterations that have been characterized as activating, such as observed here, are predicted to be oncogenic (Kang et al., 2005; 15647370, Ikenoue et al., 2005; 15930273, Gymnopoulos et al., 2007; 17376864, Horn et al., 2008; 18317450, Rudd et al., 2011; 21266528, Hon et al., 2012; 22120714, Burke et al., 2012; 22949682, Wu et al., 2009; 19915146, Dbouk et al., 2010; 2103068, Dan et al., 2010; 20530683, Oda et al., 2008; 18829572, Zhao and Vogt, 2008; 18794883, Lui et al., 2013; 23619167, Ross et al., 2013; 22430209, Riviere et al., 2012; 22729224, Shibata et al., 2009; 19394761, Droguluk et al., 2015; 26627007, Croessmann et al., 2018; 29284706, Ng et al., 2018; 29533785, Spangle et al., 2020; 32929011, Chen et al., 2018; 29636477, Jin et al., 2021; 34779417). PIK3CA mutations have been reported in 9% of glioblastoma (GBM) samples analyzed in the TCGA dataset (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142), and other studies report the incidence of PIK3CA mutations in primary GBMs as 5_18% (Gallia et al., 2006; 17050665, Broderick et al., 2004; 15289301, El_Habr et al., 2010; 20569675). One study detected PIK3CA mutation in 16% (36/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). PIK3CA mutations have been reported in 5_23% of high_grade gliomas (including glioblastomas, anaplastic astrocytomas, and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas) (El_Habr et al., 2010; 20569675, Gallia et al., 2006; 17050665, Broderick et al., 2004; 15289301, Derakhshandeh_Peykar et al., 2011; 22026810, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890). While another study did not observe PIK3CA mutations in low_grade astrocytomas or in anaplastic astrocytomas, it did report high ERK and AKT activity (El_Habr et al., 2010; 20569675). One study found that PIK3CA mutation in glioblastoma (GBM) was associated with shorter median PFS in both a discovery cohort (6.9 vs. 12.4 months, HR=2.89, p=0.01) and in the TCGA cohort (6.1 vs. 9 months, p=0.008), but was not consistently associated with median OS (Tanaka et al., 2019; 31036078). In a study of IDH_wildtype GBM, patients with alterations in PI3K class I genes (PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PIK3CG, and PIK3R2) had significantly longer OS (20.0 months altered vs. 16.9 months wildtype, HR=0.62, p=0.002) and PFS (11.0 months altered vs. 7.4 months wildtype, p=0.0043); patients with PIK3CA alterations experienced an improved OS but this association was not highly significant (20.0 months altered vs. 18.1 months wildtype, p=0.0407)(Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Clinical and preclinical data in various tumor types indicate that PIK3CA activating alterations may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting PI3K (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574, Juric et al., 2018; 29401002, Gallant et al., 2019; 30793038, Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23, Delestre et al., 2021; 34613809), AKT (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Smyth et al., 2021; 33863913), or mTOR (Park et al., 2016; 27105424, Lim et al., 2016; 26859683, Hou et al., 2014; 25426553, Varnier et al., 2019; 31351267, Janku et al., 2014; 24440717, Moroney et al., 2012; 22927482, Basho et al., 2017; 27893038, Moroney et al., 2011; 21890452). In the Phase 2 MATCH trial for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors, 28% (18/65) of patients experienced PFS lasting at least 6 months after treatment with taselisib; however, no ORs were observed in this study (Krop et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 101). A separate Phase 1b study of taselisib in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors reported an ORR of 0% (n=12) and a DCR of 17% (2/12) (Pascual et al., 2021; 32958578). In a Phase 1 trial of the dual PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitor apitolisib, 79% (11/14) of patients with PIK3CA_mutated advanced solid tumors experienced disease control (3 PRs, 8 SDs) (Dolly et al., 2016; 26787751). The PI3K inhibitor alpelisib is approved as a single agent for the treatment of patients with PIK3CA_related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) (Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23) but has shown limited activity as monotherapy for PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors with a Phase 1a study reporting an ORR of 6.0% (8/134) and a DCR of 58% (78/134) (Juric et al., 2018; 2941002). The PI3K inhibitor copanlisib exhibited limited efficacy in PIK3CA_mutated tumors (Santin et al., 2020; 31934607, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PIK3CA activating mutations may lead to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may therefore indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.

PIK3CA alterations that have been characterized as activating, such as observed here, are predicted to be oncogenic (Kang et al., 2005; 15647370, Ikenoue et al., 2005; 15930273, Gymnopoulos et al., 2007; 17376864, Horn et al., 2008; 18317450, Rudd et al., 2011; 21266528, Hon et al., 2012; 22120714, Burke et al., 2012; 22949682, Wu et al., 2009; 19915146, Dbouk et al., 2010; 2103068, Dan et al., 2010; 20530683, Oda et al., 2008; 18829572, Zhao and Vogt, 2008; 18794883, Lui et al., 2013; 23619167, Ross et al., 2013; 22430209, Riviere et al., 2012; 22729224, Shibata et al., 2009; 19394761, Droguluk et al., 2015; 26627007, Croessmann et al., 2018; 29284706, Ng et al., 2018; 29533785, Spangle et al., 2020; 32929011, Chen et al., 2018; 29636477, Jin et al., 2021; 34779417). PIK3CA mutations have been reported in 9% of glioblastoma (GBM) samples analyzed in the TCGA dataset (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142), and other studies report the incidence of PIK3CA mutations in primary GBMs as 5_18% (Gallia et al., 2006; 17050665, Broderick et al., 2004; 15289301, El_Habr et al., 2010; 20569675). One study detected PIK3CA mutation in 16% (36/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). PIK3CA mutations have been reported in 5_23% of high_grade gliomas (including glioblastomas, anaplastic astrocytomas, and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas) (El_Habr et al., 2010; 20569675, Gallia et al., 2006; 17050665, Broderick et al., 2004; 15289301, Derakhshandeh_Peykar et al., 2011; 22026810, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890). While another study did not observe PIK3CA mutations in low_grade astrocytomas or in anaplastic astrocytomas, it did report high ERK and AKT activity (El_Habr et al., 2010; 20569675). One study found that PIK3CA mutation in glioblastoma (GBM) was associated with shorter median PFS in both a discovery cohort (6.9 vs. 12.4 months, HR=2.89, p=0.01) and in the TCGA cohort (6.1 vs. 9 months, p=0.008), but was not consistently associated with median OS (Tanaka et al., 2019; 31036078). In a study of IDH_wildtype GBM, patients with alterations in PI3K class I genes (PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PIK3CG, and PIK3R2) had significantly longer OS (20.0 months altered vs. 16.9 months wildtype, HR=0.62, p=0.002) and PFS (11.0 months altered vs. 7.4 months wildtype, p=0.0043); patients with PIK3CA alterations experienced an improved OS but this association was not highly significant (20.0 months altered vs. 18.1 months wildtype, p=0.0407)(Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Clinical and preclinical data in various tumor types indicate that PIK3CA activating alterations may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting PI3K (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574, Juric et al., 2018; 29401002, Gallant et al., 2019; 30793038, Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23, Delestre et al., 2021; 34613809), AKT (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Smyth et al., 2021; 33863913), or mTOR (Park et al., 2016; 27105424, Lim et al., 2016; 26859683, Hou et al., 2014; 25426553, Varnier et al., 2019; 31351267, Janku et al., 2014; 24440717, Moroney et al., 2012; 22927482, Basho et al., 2017; 27893038, Moroney et al., 2011; 21890452). In the Phase 2 MATCH trial for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors, 28% (18/65) of patients experienced PFS lasting at least 6 months after treatment with taselisib; however, no ORs were observed in this study (Krop et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 101). A separate Phase 1b study of taselisib in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors reported an ORR of 0% (n=12) and a DCR of 17% (2/12) (Pascual et al., 2021; 32958578). In a Phase 1 trial of the dual PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitor apitolisib, 79% (11/14) of patients with PIK3CA_mutated advanced solid tumors experienced disease control (3 PRs, 8 SDs) (Dolly et al., 2016; 26787751). The PI3K inhibitor alpelisib is approved as a single agent for the treatment of patients with PIK3CA_related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) (Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23) but has shown limited activity as monotherapy for PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors with a Phase 1a study reporting an ORR of 6.0% (8/134) and a DCR of 58% (78/134) (Juric et al., 2018; 2941002). The PI3K inhibitor copanlisib exhibited limited efficacy in PIK3CA_mutated tumors (Santin et al., 2020; 31934607, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PIK3CA activating mutations may lead to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may therefore indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.

A Phase 1/2 trial of temsirolimus in combination with sorafenib in glioblastoma was terminated at the Phase 2 interim analysis after patients failed to meet the primary endpoint of 6 month progression_free survival; significant toxicity was also observed in the combination therapy, even at low doses of temsirolimus (Lee et al., 2012; 23099651). A Phase 2 study showed that addition of temsirolimus to bevacizumab therapy in patients with recurrent glioblastoma did not add clinical benefit (Lassen et al., 2013; 23564811).

A Phase 2 trial of radiotherapy (RT), temozolomide (TMZ), and bevacizumab followed by everolimus and bevacizumab reported that 61% (31/51) of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma had objective responses with a median progression_free survival (PFS) of 11.3 months and median overall survival (OS) of 13.9 months (Hainsworth et al., 2012; 22706484). A Phase 2 study of everolimus combined with TMZ and RT for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma reported a median PFS of 6.4 months and median OS of 15.8 months (Ma et al., 2014; 25526733). A Phase 1 trial of everolimus plus TMZ for patients with newly diagnosed or progressive glioblastoma reported partial responses (PR) in 11% (3/28) and stable disease (SD) in 57% (16/28) of cases (Mason et al., 2011; 22160854). A pilot study of everolimus with gefitinib in patients with recurrent glioblastoma reported 14% (3/22) PRs, 36% (8/22) SDs, and median PFS and OS of 2.6 months and 5.8 months, respectively (Kreisl et al., 2009; 19018475). Everolimus treatment achieved SD in 45% (5/11) of pediatric patients with heavily pretreated low_grade CNS tumors; median PFS of these responses was 14 months (Segal et al., 2016; ISPNO Abstract EPT_21). Whereas frequent adverse events precluded a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for the combination of trametinib and everolimus in a Phase 1b trial for solid tumors (Tolcher et al., 2014; 25344362), a retrospective study for heavily pretreated patients with solid tumors reported tolerable regimens of the combination for 23/31 patients, with 16 patients treated >3 months and evaluable patients achieving a median PFS of 6.5 months (Patterson et al., 2018; AACR Abstract 3891). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04589845", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03239015", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04337463", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04803318", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05125523", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03772561", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04632992", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03994796", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03673787", "Include": "true"}]}}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "CDKN2A/B", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": [{"Name": "CDKN2A loss", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "CDKN2A loss"}}, "Interpretation": "CDKN2A encodes two different, unrelated tumor suppressor proteins, p16INK4a and p14ARF, whereas CDKN2B encodes the tumor suppressor p15INK4b (Quelle et al., 1995; 8521522, Sharpless, 2005; 15878778). Both p15INK4b and p16INK4a bind to and inhibit CDK4 and CDK6, thereby maintaining the growth_suppressive activity of the Rb tumor suppressor; loss or inactivation of either p15INK4b or p16INK4a contributes to dysregulation of the CDK4/6_cyclin_Rb pathway and loss of cell cycle control (Gazzeri et al., 1998; 9484839, Roussel, 1999; 10498883). The tumor suppressive functions of p14ARF involve stabilization and activation of p53, via a mechanism of MDM2 inhibition (Sherr et al., 2005; 16869746, Ozenne et al., 2010; 20549699). One or more alterations observed here are predicted to result in p16INK4a loss of function (Ruas et al., 1999; 10498896, Jones et al., 2007; 17909018, Haferkamp et al., 2008; 18843795, Huot et al., 2002; 12417717, Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Gombart et al., 1997; 9324288, Yang et al., 1995; 7780957, Parry and Peters, 1996; 8668202, Greenblatt et al., 2003; 12606942, Yarbrough et al., 1999; 10491434, Poi et al., 2001; 11255261, Byeon et al., 1998; 9660926, Kannengiesser et al., 2009; 19260062, Lal et al., 2000; 10719365, Koh et al., 1995; 7777061, McKenzie et al., 2010; 20340136, Miller et al., 2011; 21462282, Arap et al., 1997; 905385, Scaini et al., 2014; 24659262, Jenkins et al., 2013; 23190892, Walker et al., 1999; 10389768, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). One or more alterations seen here are predicted to result in p14ARF loss of function (Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Itahana and Zhang, 2008; 18538737, Zhang and Xiong, 1999; 10360174, Zhang et al., 1998; 9529249, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). CDKN2B alterations such as seen here are predicted to inactivate p15INK4b (Jafri et al., 2015; 25873077). Concurrent putative homozygous deletion of CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been reported in 35% of patients with gliomas (cBio_Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661) and detected more frequently in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; 58%)(cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142) than in those with lower grade gliomas (13%) (cBioPortal, Sep 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). In other studies, loss of CDKN2A/B by deletion has been reported in up to 78% of astrocytomas (including anaplastic astrocytomas and GBM) (Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Weber et al., 2007; 16909113). A study found homozygous deletion of both p16INK4a and p14ARF in 26% (13/50) of glioblastomas (GBMs); 18% (9/50) of cases showed homozygous deletion of the p14ARF_encoding locus alone (Nakamura et al., 2001; 11303791). One study detected CDKN2A/B loss in 69% (161/232) and mutation in 2.6% (6/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Decreased p14ARF and p16INK4a expression levels were found to be tightly associated in a study of glioma samples (Chakravarti et al., 2001; 11489817). Homozygous deletion of the genomic region including CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been found to be associated with poor prognosis in GBM and likely serves as an early event in GBM progression (Feng et al., 2012; 21713760, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337). In addition, expression of p16INK4a has been found to be lower in patients with high grade malignant gliomas compared to patients with low grade gliomas, and loss of p16INK4a expression has been associated with shorter overall survival in pilocytic astrocytomas (Raabe et al., 2011; 21636552, Liu et al., 2011; 21843312). Preclinical data suggest that tumors with loss of p16INK4a function may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, ribociclib, and palbociclib (Konecny et al., 2011; 21278246, Katsumi et al., 2011; 21871868, Cen et al., 2012; 22711607, Logan et al., 2013; 23898052). Although case studies have reported that patients with breast cancer or uterine leiomyosarcoma harboring CDKN2A loss responded to palbociclib treatment (Elvin et al., 2017; 28283584, Gao et al., 2015; 26715889), multiple other clinical studies have shown no significant correlation between p16INK4a loss or inactivation and therapeutic benefit of these agents (Gopalan et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8077, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Konecny et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5557)(DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Johnson et al., 2014; 24797823); it is not known whether CDK4/6 inhibitors would be beneficial in this case. Although preclinical studies have suggested that loss of p14ARF function may be associated with reduced sensitivity to MDM2 inhibitors (Van Maerken et al., 2011; 21460101, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357), the clinical relevance of p14ARF as a predictive biomarker is not clear. There are no drugs that directly target the mutation or loss of CDKN2B in cancer. Because the p15INK4b protein encoded by CDKN2B is known to inhibit CDK4, tumors with CDKN2B mutation or loss may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as ribociclib, abemaciclib, and palbociclib (Infante et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 2528, Shapiro et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 2500)(Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126). Germline CDKN2A mutation is associated with melanoma_pancreatic cancer syndrome, a condition marked by increased risk of developing malignant melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer (Whelan et al., 1995; 7666917). Mutation carriers within families may develop either or both types of cancer, and melanoma cases may be referred to as familial or hereditary melanoma (Hansson, 2010; 20687502, Hogg et al., 1998; 9479083). CDKN2A is the most implicated gene in familial melanoma, with germline mutations present in 16% to 20% of familial melanoma cases (De Unamuno et al., 2018; 29543703, Soura et al., 2016; 26892650, Huerta et al., 2018; 29405243). CDKN2A alteration has also been implicated in familial melanoma_astrocytoma syndrome, an extremely rare tumor association characterized by dual predisposition to melanoma and nervous system tumors (Kaufman et al., 1993; 8414022, Bahuau et al., 1998; 9622062, Chan et al., 2017; 28699883). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of CDKN2A is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}, {"Name": "CDKN2B loss", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "CDKN2B loss"}}, "Interpretation": "CDKN2A encodes two different, unrelated tumor suppressor proteins, p16INK4a and p14ARF, whereas CDKN2B encodes the tumor suppressor p15INK4b (Quelle et al., 1995; 8521522, Sharpless, 2005; 15878778).

One or more alterations observed here are predicted to result in p16INK4a loss of function (Ruas et al., 1999; 10498896, Jones et al., 2007; 17909018, Haferkamp et al., 2008; 18843795, Huot et al., 2002; 12417717, Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Gombart et al., 1997; 9324288, Yang et al., 1995; 7780957, Parry and Peters, 1996; 8668202, Greenblatt et al., 2003; 12606942, Yarbrough et al., 1999; 10491434, Poi et al., 2001; 11255261, Byeon et al., 1998; 9660926, Kannengiesser et al., 2009; 19260062, Lal et al., 2000; 10719365, Koh et al., 1995; 7777061, McKenzie et al., 2010; 20340136, Miller et al., 2011; 21462282, Arap et al., 1997; 905385, Scaini et al., 2014; 24659262, Jenkins et al., 2013; 23190892, Walker et al., 1999; 10389768, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). One or more alterations seen here are predicted to result in p14ARF loss of function (Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Itahana and Zhang, 2008; 18538737, Zhang and Xiong, 1999; 10360174, Zhang et al., 1998; 9529249, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). CDKN2B alterations such as seen here are predicted to inactivate p15INK4b (Jafri et al., 2015; 25873077). Concurrent putative homozygous deletion of CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been reported in 35% of patients with gliomas (cBio_Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661) and detected more frequently in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; 58%)(cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142) than in those with lower grade gliomas (13%) (cBioPortal, Sep 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). In other studies, loss of CDKN2A/B by deletion has been reported in up to 78% of astrocytomas (including anaplastic astrocytomas and GBM) (Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Weber et al., 2007; 16909113). A study found homozygous deletion of both p16INK4a and p14ARF in 26% (13/50) of glioblastomas (GBMs); 18% (9/50) of cases showed homozygous deletion of the p14ARF_encoding locus alone (Nakamura et al., 2001; 11303791). One study detected CDKN2A/B loss in 69% (161/232) and mutation in 2.6% (6/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Decreased p14ARF and p16INK4a expression levels were found to be tightly associated in a study of glioma samples (Chakravarti et al., 2001; 11489817). Homozygous deletion of the genomic region including CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been found to be associated with poor prognosis in GBM and likely serves as an early event in GBM progression (Feng et al., 2012; 21713760, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337). In addition, expression of p16INK4a has been found to be lower in patients with high grade malignant gliomas compared to patients with low grade gliomas, and loss of p16INK4a expression has been associated with shorter overall survival in pilocytic astrocytomas (Raabe et al., 2011; 21636552, Liu et al., 2011; 21843312). Preclinical data suggest that tumors with loss of p16INK4a function may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, ribociclib, and palbociclib (Konecny et al., 2011; 21278246, Katsumi et al., 2011; 21871868, Cen et al., 2012; 22711607, Logan et al., 2013; 23898052). Although case studies have reported that patients with breast cancer or uterine leiomyosarcoma harboring CDKN2A loss responded to palbociclib treatment (Elvin et al., 2017; 28283584, Gao et al., 2015; 26715889), multiple other clinical studies have shown no significant correlation between p16INK4a loss or inactivation and therapeutic benefit of these agents (Gopalan et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8077, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Konecny et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5557)(DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Johnson et al., 2014; 24797823); it is not known whether CDK4/6 inhibitors would be beneficial in this case. Although preclinical studies have suggested that loss of p14ARF function may be associated with reduced sensitivity to MDM2 inhibitors (Van Maerken et al., 2011; 21460101, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357), the clinical relevance of p14ARF as a predictive biomarker is not clear. There are no drugs that directly target the mutation or loss of CDKN2B in cancer. Because the p15INK4b protein encoded by CDKN2B is known to inhibit CDK4, tumors with CDKN2B mutation or loss may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as ribociclib, abemaciclib, and palbociclib (Infante et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 2528, Shapiro et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 2500)(Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126). Germline CDKN2A mutation is associated with melanoma_pancreatic cancer syndrome, a condition marked by increased risk of developing malignant melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer (Whelan et al., 1995; 7666917). Mutation carriers within families may develop either or both types of cancer, and melanoma cases may be referred to as familial or hereditary melanoma (Hansson, 2010; 20687502, Hogg et al., 1998; 9479083). CDKN2A is the most implicated gene in familial melanoma, with germline mutations present in 16% to 20% of familial melanoma cases (De Unamuno et al., 2018; 29543703, Soura et al., 2016; 26892650, Huerta et al., 2018; 29405243). CDKN2A alteration has also been implicated in familial melanoma_astrocytoma syndrome, an extremely rare tumor association characterized by dual predisposition to melanoma and nervous system tumors (Kaufman et al., 1993; 8414022, Bahuau et al., 1998; 9622062, Chan et al., 2017; 28699883). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of CDKN2A is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "MUTYH", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "W142*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "W142*"}}, "Interpretation": "MUTYH (also known as MYH) encodes an enzyme involved in DNA base excision repair, and loss of function mutations in MUTYH result in increased rates of mutagenesis and promotion of tumorigenesis (David et al., 2007; 17581577). The two most frequently reported MUTYH loss of function mutations are G382D (also referred to as G396D) and Y165C (also referred to as Y179C) (Molatore et al., 2010; 19953527, Kundu et al., 2009; 19836313, D Agostino et al., 2010; 20418187, Hegde et al., 2014; 24310308, Aretz et al., 2013; 22872101). Numerous other MUTYH mutations have also been shown to result in loss of function (Molatore et al., 2010; 19953527, Kundu et al., 2009; 19836313, Ali et al., 2008; 18534194, D Agostino et al., 2010; 20418187). In general, somatic MUTYH mutations are infrequently reported across cancer types (COSMIC, 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Monoallelic MUTYH mutation occurs in 1_2% of the general population (Hegde et al., 2014; 24310308, Aretz et al., 2013; 22872101). There is conflicting data regarding the impact of monoallelic mutations on the risk of developing CRC (Win et al., 2014; 24444654, Lubbe et al., 2009; 19620482, Jones et al., 2009; 19394335). Patients with MUTYH_mutant CRC were reported to have significantly improved overall survival compared to patients without MUTYH mutation (Nielsen et al., 2010; 21044966). There are no therapies or clinical trials available to address MUTYH alterations in cancer. One or more of the MUTYH variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with MUTYH_associated polyposis (ClinVar, Sep 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline biallelic MUTYH mutation causes MUTYH_associated polyposis (also known as MYH_associated polyposis or MAP), an autosomal recessive condition characterized by multiple colorectal adenomas and increased lifetime risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) (Hegde et al., 2014; 24310308, Sampson et al., 2003; 12853198, Sieber et al., 2003; 12606733, Al_Tassan et al., 2002; 11818965). MAP accounts for approximately 0.7% of all CRC cases and 2% of early_onset CRC cases (Hegde et al., 2014; 24310308). In contrast to CRC, the role of MUTYH mutation in the context of other cancer types is not well established (Rennert et al., 2012; 21952991, Zhang et al., 2006; 16492928, von der Th\u00fcsen et al., 2011; 21189386, Casper et al., 2014; 24420788, Smith et al., 2009; 20110747). Estimates for the prevalence of MAP in the general population range from 1:5,000_1:10,000 (Aretz et al., 2013; 22872101). Therefore, in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of MUTYH is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). Low_level MSI has been reported in 5_9% of glioblastoma (GBM) samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927, Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285, Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). A large_scale study did not find high_level microsatellite instability (MSI_H) in any of 129 GBM samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), although a small_scale study reported MSI_H in 4 of 15 pediatric GBMs and 1 of 12 adult GBMs (Szybka et al., 2003; 12908754). The frequency of MSI has been reported to be increased in relapsed compared to primary GBM (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), in GBMs with a previous lower grade astrocytoma (Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285), and in giant cell GBM compared to classic GBM (Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TERT", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "promoter _124C>T", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "promoter _124C>T"}}, "Interpretation": "Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT, or hTERT) is a catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex, which is required to maintain appropriate chromosomal length (Shay et al., 2011; 22015685). Activation of TERT is a hallmark of cancer, being detected in up to 80_90% of malignancies and absent in quiescent cells (Shay et al., 1997; 9282118, Kim et al., 1994; 7605428, Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000; 10647931). Mutations within the promoter region of TERT that confer enhanced TERT promoter activity have been reported in two hotspots, located at _124 bp and _146 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (also termed C228T and C250T, respectively)(Horn et al., 2013; 23348503, Huang et al., 2014; 23348506, Vinagre et al., 2013; 23887589), as well as tandem mutations at positions \u2013124/\u2013125 bp and \u2013138/\u2013139 bp (Horn et al., 2013; 23348503). TERT promoter mutations have been reported in 51_59% of gliomas (Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Killela et al., 2014; 24722048), most frequently in glioblastoma (GBM, 54_84%), gliosarcoma (81%), oligodendroglioma (78%), and historically in oligoastrocytomas (25_31%) but less frequently in lower grade astrocytomas (10_18%) and in only 1% of ependymomas (Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Liu et al., 2013; 23603989, Koelsche et al., 2013; 24154961, Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Killela et al., 2014; 24722048). In patients with glioblastoma (GBM), the prevalence of TERT promoter mutation is lower in pediatric primary GBM (11%) and adult secondary GBM (28%) compared with adult primary GBM (58_83%) (Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Killela et al., 2013; 23530248). One study detected TERT promoter mutations in 78% (181/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). TERT promoter mutation has been shown to be significantly associated with increased TERT gene expression in astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and GBM (Arita et al., 2013; 23764841). TERT promoter mutations significantly associate with poor prognosis in patients with GBM, although this correlation may be due to the association with primary GBM as opposed to IDH_positive secondary GBM (Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Reitman et al., 2013; 24217890, Arita et al., 2013; 23764841). In the context of IDH_wildtype glioma, TERT mutations are associated with reduced OS (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021). Therapeutic options for targeting tumors with TERT mutations are limited, although a variety of approaches have been investigated, including immunotherapies using TERT as a tumor_associated antigen and antisense oligonucleotide_ or peptide_based therapies. TERT peptide vaccines showed limited anticancer efficacy in clinical trials (Zanetti et al., 2017; 27245281); however, in one preclinical study, the combination of a TERT peptide vaccine and anti_CTLA_4 therapy suppressed tumor growth (Duperret at al., 2018; 29249395). A Phase 2 study of the TERT inhibitor imetelstat for patients with advanced non_small cell lung cancer reported no improvement in PFS or OS (Chiappori et al., 2015; 25467017). TERT mutations are associated with 1p/19q co_deletion in oligodendrogliomas, and are highly recurrent in IDH/ATRX_wildtype glioblastoma (GBM) (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021)(Weller et al., 2020; 33293629). The presence of EGFR gene amplification or TERT promoter mutations are indicative of diffuse astrocytic glioma with molecular features of glioblastoma, WHO grade 4 in IDH1/2_wildtype tumors (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021) (Louis et al., 2021; 34185076).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "V272L", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "V272L"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). In the TCGA dataset, TP53 alterations have been reported in 35% of glioblastomas (GBMs), with a high incidence in pediatric and secondary GBMs and a low incidence in primary GBMs (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890, Jha et al., 2011; 22089350). One study detected TP53 alterations in 31% (73/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed, with most of the events being mutations (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). TP53 mutations have been reported in 18_40% of astrocytoma samples, and preferentially in anaplastic astrocytoma; one study reported TP53 loss of function and partially/fully functional mutations in 15% and 25% of anaplastic astrocytomas, respectively (Uno et al., 2005; 15914282, Uno et al., 2006; 16711514, Lass et al., 2012; 22844452, Faria et al., 2012; 23009112, Milinkovic et al., 2013; 24358143, Galatro et al., 2013; 23613880). Some studies suggest that the presence of a TP53 mutation is correlated with a favorable prognosis in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) (Schmidt et al., 2002; 11939587). One study reported that TP53 alterations were associated with poorer OS (12.9 months altered vs. 19.7 months wildtype, HR=1.58, p=0.0054) in IDH_wildtype GBM (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Mutation of TP53 is thought to be an early step in the tumorigenesis of astrocytomas, which can progress into anaplastic astrocytoma and then glioblastoma through gain of other genetic abnormalities such as loss of CDKN2A or RB1, followed by loss of PTEN (Nozaki et al., 1999; 11550308). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may also be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as APR_246 (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571, Lehmann et al., 2012; 22965953, Mohell et al., 2015; 26086967, Franssonet al., 2016; 27179933). In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, APR_246 combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "01", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "01"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Touat et al., 2020; 32322066, Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556, Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642). Glioblastoma (GBM) harbors a median TMB of 2.7 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 4.2% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). For pediatric patients, high TMB has been reported in a subset of high_grade gliomas, frequently in association with mutations in mismatch repair or proofreading genes and in TP53, whereas BRAF alterations or other oncogene fusions were observed more frequently in brain tumors harboring low TMB (Patel et al., 2020; 32386112, Johnson et al., 2017; 28912153). Increased TMB has been reported to correlate with higher tumor grade in glioma (Draaisma et al., 2015; 26699864) and glioblastoma (GBM) tissue samples with biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD) (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570), as well as with shorter OS of patients with diffuse glioma (Wang et al., 2020; 32164609). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In glioma, a lack of association between TMB and clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors has been reported (Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Touat et al., 2020; 32322066). However, multiple case studies have reported that patients with ultramutated gliomas driven by POLE mutations have benefited from treatment with anti_PD_1 (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556) or anti_PD_L1 (Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642) therapies. Therefore, although increased TMB alone may not be a strong biomarker for PD_1 or PD_L1 inhibitors in this cancer type, these agents may have efficacy for patients with glioma harboring both high TMB and POLE mutation.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "EGFR", "Alteration": "EGFR_SEPT14 rearrangement, EGFR_SEPT14 fusionamplification", "Title": "GC1118 in Recurrent Glioblastoma Patients With High EGFR Amplification", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "EGFR", "Locations": "Seoul (Korea, Republic of)", "NCTID": "NCT03618667", "Note": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.
