For patients who progressed on afatinib monotherapy, additional clinical benefit has been reported from afatinib combined with paclitaxel (Schuler et al., 2016; 26646759). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Dacomitinib", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Dacomitinib is a second generation irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the kinase domains of EGFR, ERBB2/HER2, and ERBB4/HER4.

LKB1 acts as a tumor suppressor in cancer, as loss of function promotes proliferation and tumorigenesis (Carretero et al., 2010; 20541700, Ollila et al., 2011; 21926085). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt STK11 function or expression (Qui et al., 2007; 16407837, Mehenni et al., 1998; 9837816, Karuman et al., 2001; 11430832, Baas et al., 2003; 12805220, Zeng and Berger, 2006; 17108107, Boudeau et al., 2004; 15561763, Scott et al., 2007; 17575127, Xie et al., 2009; 19414597, Boudeau et al., 2003; 12552571, Forcet et al., 2005; 15800014, Zhang et al., 2015; 25960268, Berger et al., 2016; 27478040). Several clinical studies have found STK11 mutation to be common in non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (15_35%), with alterations more prevalent in lung adenocarcinomas (13_34%) than in lung squamous cell carcinoma (2_19%) (Koivunen et al., 2008; 18594528, Ji et al., 2007; 17676035, An et al., 2012; 22768234, Liu et al., 2013; 23715154, Gao et al., 2010; 20559149, Hammerman et al., 2012; 22960745, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975). In the TCGA datasets, STK11 homozygous deletion was observed in 1% of lung adenocarcinoma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552) and was not observed in any of 178 lung squamous cell carcinoma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745). STK11 mutations in NSCLC often co_occur with activating KRAS mutations (Liu et al., 2013; 23715154, Gao et al., 2010; 20559149). In transgenic mouse models, animals expressing mutant KRAS developed lung adenocarcinomas, whereas the KRAS_mutant/LKB1_deficient mice developed an expanded histological spectrum of tumors that included large cell and squamous cell carcinomas (Ji et al., 2007; 17676035). Strongly decreased or absent expression of LKB1 correlated with inferior outcome in patients with NSCLC treated with bevacizumab_containing chemotherapy; expression of LKB1 was not prognostic in patients treated with chemotherapy without bevacizumab (Bonanno et al., 2017; 28119362). Increased mTOR signaling is present in LKB1_deficient tumors, suggesting therapies targeting mTOR may be relevant for tumors with STK11 alterations (Shaw et al., 2004; 15261145, Ji et al., 2007; 17676035, Contreras et al., 2008; 18245476, Gurumurthy et al., 2008; 18172296, Shackelford et al., 2009; 19541609). Case studies have reported PRs for 2 patients with STK11_mutated pancreatic cancer following treatment with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (Kl\u00fcmpen et al., 2011; 21189378, Moreira et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 315), with 1 PR observed in a PJS patient for 9 months until progression (Kl\u00fcmpen et al., 2011; 21189378). However, retrospective analysis of a Phase 2 trial for patients with endometrial carcinoma found LKB1 (STK11) protein levels were not significantly correlated with response to everolimus treatment (Tredan et al., 2013; 23238879). In one preclinical study, STK11 loss was associated with sensitivity to combination treatment including an SRC inhibitor (Carretero et al., 2010; 20541700); however, the clinical relevance of these findings has not been established. STK11 alteration is associated with poorer response to immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including those with tumors harboring co_occurring KRAS or KEAP1 mutations. Following anti_PD_1_based regimens, retrospective analyses have reported shorter OS for patients with KRAS and STK11 co_mutated tumors than for patients with wild_type STK11 (6.4 vs. 16.1 months, HR=1.99)(Skoulidis et al., 2018; 29773717), as well as markedly fewer objective responses for patients with KRAS/STK11 co_mutated versus KRAS/TP53 co_mutated tumors in the CheckMate_057, CheckMate_012, and GEMINI trials (0% vs. 53_78%%)(Skoulidis et al., 2018; 29773717, Skoulidis et al., 2017; IASLC 17th WCLC Abstract MA04.07, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128), although a case study reported ongoing response for 1 patient with KRAS/STK11 co_mutations treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab (Stein et al., 2019; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00211). Patients with NSCLC and concurrent mutation of STK11 and KEAP1 (n=39) who received treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor experienced significantly shorter PFS (1.6 vs. 2.5 months; HR=1.5) and OS (4 vs. 11 months; HR=1.9) compared with patients with STK11_ and KEAP1_wild_type tumors (n=210) despite significantly higher TMB in the group harboring STK11 and KEAP1 mutations (median 9.4 vs. 6.1 Muts/Mb) (Arbour et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract MA19.09). However, exploratory analyses of patients with NSCLC treated in the first_line setting with pembrolizumab showed trends towards improved ORR and OS irrespective of STK11 or KEAP1 mutation status, though this was not demonstrated to be statistically significant (Cho et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT084, Gadgeel et al., 2020; AACR Abstract LB_397). In the absence of co_mutations, reduced clinical benefit has also been reported for patients with NSCLC harboring STK11 mutations compared with wild_type STK11 and either anti_PD_L1 (Skoulidis et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract MA19.10, Jure_Kunkel et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 3028) or anti_PD_1 therapy (Stephens, 2017; AACR Abstract SY40_02). Germline mutations in STK11 underlie Peutz_Jeghers syndrome (PJS), a rare autosomal dominant disorder associated with a predisposition for tumor formation (Amos et al., 2004; 15121768). This disorder has an estimated frequency between 1:29,000 and 1:120,000, although reported rates in the literature vary greatly (Hearle et al., 2006; 16707622, Amos et al., 2004; 15121768, van der Groep et al., 2011; 21336636). Although gastrointestinal tumors are the most common malignancies associated with PJS, patients also exhibit an 18_fold increased risk of developing other epithelial cancers (Hearle et al., 2006; 16707622, Amos et al., 2004; 15121768, van der Groep et al., 2011; 21336636), and individuals with this syndrome have a 30_50% risk of developing breast cancer (Amos et al., 2004; 15121768, van der Groep et al., 2011; 21336636).

High bTMB levels were not detected in this sample. It is unclear whether the bTMB levels in this sample would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Depending on the clinical context, TMB testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. NSCLC harbors a median bTMB of 16.8 Muts/Mb (range 1.9_52.5 Muts/Mb)(Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950). Retrospective analysis of the Phase 3 OAK and Phase 2 POPLAR trials for patients with advanced or metastatic non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) reported that bTMB \u22657 Muts/Mb was associated with shorter PFS (2.8 vs. 4.2 months) and OS (7.4 vs. 11.9 months) compared with bTMB <7 Muts/Mb for patients treated with docetaxel (Nie et al., 2020; 32380463). In one study of advanced NSCLC in China, bTMB \u22656 Muts/Mb was associated with decreased PFS (10 vs. 18 months) and OS (11 vs. 25 months) compared with bTMB <6 Muts/Mb for patients treated with platinum_based chemotherapy (Ma et al., 2021; 34055609). A meta_analysis of 19 studies of immune checkpoint inhibitor_treated NSCLC (n = 2,315 patients) demonstrated that high TMB predicted a significantly longer OS than low TMB (HR = 0.70), and within the high TMB group, immunotherapy was associated with an improved PFS (HR = 0.62, P<0.001), OS (HR = 0.67, P<0.001) and a higher response rate (OR = 2.35, P<0.001) compared to chemotherapy (Meng et al., 2022; 35113949). In contrast, a large study of Chinese patients with untreated lung adenocarcinoma reported a shorter median OS for tumors with a higher number of mutations in a limited gene set compared with a lower mutation number (48.4 vs. 61.0 months)(Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843). Another study of patients with NSCLC treated with EGFR inhibitors or platinum doublet chemotherapy found elevated TMB to be correlated with poorer prognosis, as well as finding lower TMB in combination with PD_L1 negative status to be significantly associated with longer median survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). However, no significant prognostic association of TMB and/or PD_L1 status with survival has been reported in patients with lung SCC (Yu et al., 2019; 30253973, Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). On the basis of clinical evidence in NSCLC and HSNCC, increased bTMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511) and anti_PD_1 (Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074) therapies. In NSCLC, multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 to 16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). In HNSCC, a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "KEAP1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "V79fs*48", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "V79fs*48"}}, "Interpretation": "KEAP1 encodes a substrate adaptor protein that regulates the cellular response to oxidative stress by providing substrate specificity for a CUL3_dependent ubiquitin ligase (Lo and Hannink, 2006; 17046835). KEAP1 exerts anti_tumor effects through negative regulation of NRF2, a transcription factor encoded by NFE2L2 (Wakabayashi et al., 2003; 14517554, Kansanen et al., 2013; 24024136, Hast et al., 2013; 23382044); KEAP1 inactivation promotes cancer progression through NRF2_mediated chemoresistance and cell growth (Kansanen et al., 2013; 24024136, Hast et al., 2013; 23382044). Somatic mutation of KEAP1 occurs in a range of solid tumors, including gastric, hepatocellular, colorectal, and lung cancers (Yoo et al., 2012; 22348534). KEAP1 mutations are rare in hematological malignancies, occurring in fewer than 1% of samples analyzed (COSMIC, 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). In a retrospective analysis of the pan_solid MSKCC dataset, KEAP1 mutation correlated with reduced OS (13.28 vs. 26.53 months) (Xu et al., 2020; 32272498). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), mutation of KEAP1 and/or NFE2L2 also correlated with reduced median OS (11.51 vs. 22.32 months) (Xu et al., 2020; 32272498). In another study, for NSCLC treated with frontline chemotherapy, multivariate analysis showed that KEAP1 and/or NFE2L2 mutations significantly associated with reduced survival for patients with adenocarcinoma (PFS HR=2.34, OS HR=1.96) but not for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (Goeman et al., 2019; 31323387). A study of patients with localized non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) identified pathogenic KEAP1 and NFE2L2 mutations as predictors of local recurrence following radiotherapy but not surgery; limited preclinical data also showed that treatment with a glutaminase inhibitor sensitized KEAP1_mutated NSCLC cells to radiation (Binkley et al., 2020; 33071215). In other preclinical studies, treatment with AKT inhibitors sensitized lung cancer cells harboring KEAP1 or NFE2L2 mutations to both chemotherapy and radiation therapy (Chowdhry et al., 2013; 22964642, Abazeed et al., 2013; 23980093). Mixed clinical data have been reported for the association between KEAP1 mutations and the response to immunotherapy. A pan_cancer study of immunotherapy showed that patients with KEAP1 mutations had shorter OS (10 vs. 20 months) than those without (Chen et al., 2020; 32175433). However, another study across solid tumors showed that KEAP1 mutations were associated with higher tumor mutational burden (TMB) and PD_L1 expression, as well as improved survival outcomes with immunotherapy compared with other treatments (20.0 vs. 11.5 months) (Xu et al., 2020; 32272498). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a study of PD_L1 inhibitors showed that patients with concurrent mutations of STK11 and KEAP1 (n=39) experienced significantly shorter PFS (1.6 vs. 2.5 months, HR=1.5) and OS (4 vs. 11 months, HR=1.9) compared with patients with STK11_ and KEAP1_wildtype tumors (n=210) despite significantly higher TMB in the group harboring STK11 and KEAP1 mutations (median 9.4 vs. 6.1 Muts/Mb) (Arbour et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract MA19.09). Retrospective analyses of patients with NSCLC who received immunotherapy reported reduced OS (p=0.040) for patients harboring KEAP1_ or NFE2L2_mutated tumors (Zhang et al., 2020; 32471565) or STK11_ or KEAP1_mutated tumors (p <0.001) (Shang et al., 2020; WCLC Abstract P75.02) compared with those without. Studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with lung adenocarcinoma showed that coexisting mutations between KEAP1, PBRM1, SMARCA4, STK11, and KRAS were associated with worse OS (Marinelli et al., 2020; 32866624, Ricciuti et al., 2020; WCLC Abstract P14.26). An exploratory analysis of a subset of patients with PD_L1_positive NSCLC treated in the first_line setting with pembrolizumab showed similar ORR, PFS, and OS when comparing patients with STK11 or KEAP1 mutations and those without (Cho et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT084). In addition, preclinical data suggest that KEAP1 inactivation increases tumor demand for glutamine and increases tumor sensitivity to glutaminase inhibitors like telaglenastat (Gwinn et al., 2018; 29316436, Sayin et al., 2017; 28967864, Romero et al., 2017; 28967920). Limited clinical data suggest that KEAP1 mutations may predict improved clinical benefit from combinations of glutaminase inhibitors and anti_PD_1 inhibitors (Skoulidis et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract TPS9627); a Phase 1/2 study of the glutaminase inhibitor telaglenastat (CB_839) plus nivolumab to treat advanced NSCLC reported better clinical benefit rates and median PFS for patients with KEAP1 mutations (75% [3/4] vs. 15% [2/13], 6.4 vs. 3.7 months), KRAS mutations (38% [3/8] vs. 20% [2/10], 4.5 vs. 3.7 months), or KEAP1 and KRAS concurrent mutations (100% [2/2] vs. 13% [1/8], 7.2 vs. 3.7 months) compared with patients without these mutations (Skoulidis et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract TPS9627). The KEAP1 mutation has also been identified as a potential biomarker for sensitivity to combined AKT and TXNRD1 inhibition in lung cancer (Dai et al., 2013; 23824739).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Cannot Be Determined", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Cannot Be Determined"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI_H is generally infrequent in NSCLC, reported in fewer than 1% of samples across several large studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197, Ninomiya et al., 2006; 16641899, Vanderwalde et al., 2018; 29436178, Zang et al., 2019; 31270941, Dudley et al., 2016; 26880610, Takamochi et al., 2017; 28676214, Schrock et al., 2017; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2016.11.487), whereas data on the reported incidence of MSI_H in SCLC has been limited and conflicting (Pylkkanen et al., 1997; 9329646, Gonzalez et al., 2000; 11061602, Chen et al., 1996; 8782463, Merlo et al., 1994; 8174113). One study reported MSI_H in lung adenocarcinoma patients with smoking history, and 3 of 4 MSI_H patients examined also had metachronous carcinomas in other organs, although this has not been investigated in large scale studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of MSI in NSCLC are limited (PubMed, Oct 2021). On the basis of prospective clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD_1_targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143) and PD_L1_targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92). As the MSI status of this tumor is unknown, the relevance of these therapeutic approaches is unclear.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "SMARCA4", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "I1039fs*43", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "I1039fs*43"}}, "Interpretation": "SMARCA4 encodes the protein BRG1, an ATP_dependent helicase that regulates gene transcription through chromatin remodeling (Wilson and Roberts, 2011; 21654818). SMARCA4 is inactivated in a variety of cancers and considered a tumor suppressor (Shain and Pollack, 2013; 23355908). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt SMARCA4 function or expression (Trotter et al., 2008; 18086889, Shen et al., 2007; 17274598, Dykhuizen et al., 2013; 23698369, Stanton et al., 2016; 27941795, Fernando et al., 2020; 33144586). In the TCGA datasets, SMARCA4 mutations have been reported in 6% of lung adenocarcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552) and in 5% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745). Loss of BRG1 protein expression has been observed in 10_15% of non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases in the scientific literature (Matsubara et al., 2013; 23163725, Reisman et al., 2003; 12566296, Oike et al., 2013; 23872584). Loss of expression of BRG1 and BRM, another catalytic subunit in SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes, has been correlated with poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC (Matsubara et al., 2013; 23163725, Reisman et al., 2003; 12566296, Fukuoka et al., 2004; 15240517, Dagogo_Jack et al., 2020; 31988001). Clinical (Jones et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 1612PD, Italiano et al., 2018; 29650362, Penebre et al., 2015; EORTC Abstract C87) and preclinical (Jelinic et al., 2016; 26564006, Karnezis et al., 2016; 26356327, Penebre et al., 2015; EORTC Abstract C87, Kim et al., 2015; 26552009, Chan_Penebre et al., 2017; 28292935, Januario et al., 2017; 29087303, Wang et al., 2017; 28444909, Wang et al., 2018; 30232145) data suggest that patients with small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) harboring SMARCA4 loss or inactivation may benefit from treatment with EZH2 inhibitors, including tazemetostat. In addition, preclinical data have demonstrated that SMARCA4_deficient non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and SCCOHT patient_derived xenografts and cell lines are highly sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibition through a synthetic lethal mechanism of reduced cyclin D1 expression (Xue et al., 2019; 30718512, Xue et al., 2019; 30718506 ). Notably, similar drug sensitivity was detected in SMARCA4_deficient lung and ovarian tumors, thereby suggesting that SMARCA4_deficient tumors are likely to be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibition regardless of tissue of origin (Xue et al., 2019; 30718512, Xue et al., 2019; 30718506). Downregulation of BRG1 and BRM was reported to enhance cellular sensitivity to cisplatin in lung and head and neck cancer cells (Kothandapani et al., 2012; 22721696). In vitro studies have shown that SCCOHT cell lines are sensitive to treatment with epothilone B, methotrexate, and topotecan, compared to treatment with other chemotherapies such as platinum_containing compounds; similar sensitivity was not observed for treatment with ixabepilone, a compound closely related to epothilone B (Otte et al., 2014; 25103190).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TNFAIP3", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "D100fs*23", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "D100fs*23"}}, "Interpretation": "TNFAIP3 encodes tumor necrosis factor alpha_induced protein 3, also known as A20, a regulator of NF_kB signaling and apoptosis (Harhaj and Dixit, 2011; 21119682) that has both ubiquitin ligase and deubiquitinase activities (Wertz et al., 2004; 15258597, Wertz et al., 2015; 26649818) and whose loss or inactivation may be tumorigenic (Honma et al., 2009; 19608751). TNFAIP3 is frequently deleted or mutated in lymphoma, where it functions as a tumor suppressor (Honma et al., 2009; 19608751), but its expression and function are context dependent in solid tumors (Wang et al., 2016; 26909601, Couch et al., 2016; 27072986, Wang et al., 2015; 26485275, Harhaj and Dixit, 2011; 21119682, Salim et al., 2013; 23929716), leukemia (Saitoh et al., 2016; 26437781, Johansson et al., 2016; 26199174, Chen et al., 2015; 26159495), and multiple myeloma (Broyl et al., 2010; 20574050, Troppan et al., 2015; 25856582). TNFAIP3 mutations that disrupt the A20p37 chain (amino acids 371\u2013790), which mediates ubiquitin ligase activity and interaction with the cIAP1/TRAF2 complex (Wertz et al., 2004; 15258597, Yamaguchi et al., 2013; 24008839), are predicted to be inactivating. In T_cells, cleavage of A20 codon R439 by MALT1 has been shown to upregulate NFkB signaling; R439A has been shown to block MALT1_mediated NF_kB activation (Coornaert et al., 2008; 18223652); however, the function of R439 mutations outside of the context of T_cell lymphoma has not been reported. In the COSMIC dataset, TNFAIP3 mutations have been reported in 3.5% of prostate, 3.1% of endometrial, 2.8% of skin, 2.7% of gastric, and 2.4% of large intestine cancers (Jan 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). Overexpression of TNFAIP3 has been associated with aggressive high_grade ER_/PR_negative breast tumors (Vendrell et al., 2007; 17297453), resistance to TNF_alpha and TRAIL_induced apoptosis in glioblastoma (Hjelmeland et al., 2010; 20186265, Bellail et al., 2012; 22585859) and to chemotherapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Chen et al., 2015; 26159495), and poor prognosis in adrenocortical carcinoma (Hantel et al., 2016; 26768118). Loss of heterozygosity in the genomic region including TNFAIP3 has been found in 16.8% (25/149) of colorectal adenocarcinomas, and significantly decreased TNFAIP3 mRNA expression has been observed in colorectal cancer (CRC) tumors compared with adjacent non_neoplastic mucosa (Ungerb\u00e4ck et al., 2012; 22843550). Reduced A20 expression has been suggested as a marker of poor prognosis in CRC (Bavi et al., 2011; 22704353). There are no therapies that address the loss of TNFAIP3. A20 has multiple functions and is subject to a wide range of genomic lesions, thereby making it challenging to develop a unified therapeutic approach. Potential avenues targeting dysregulation of ubiquitination pathways include anti_CD20 therapies, such as rituximab, and proteasome inhibitors, such as bortezomib (Hymowitz and Wertz, 2010; 20383180). RNAi_mediated downregulation of TNFAIP3 has been reported to sensitize multiple myeloma cells to bortezomib (Zhu et al., 2011; 21289309).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Fraction", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction Not Detected", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction Not Detected"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor fraction provides an estimate of the percentage of ctDNA present in a cell_free DNA (cfDNA) sample. The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with elevated tumor fraction values have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus high sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at low risk of false negative results. However, if elevated tumor fraction is not detected, it does not exclude the presence of disease burden or compromise the confidence of reported alterations. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels. In the research setting, changes in tumor fraction estimates have been associated with treatment duration and clinical response and may be a useful indicator for future cancer management (Bronkhorst
