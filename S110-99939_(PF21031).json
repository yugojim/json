TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a bTMB level that may be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). NSCLC harbors a median bTMB of 16.8 Muts/Mb (range 1.9_52.5 Muts/Mb)(Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950). Retrospective analysis of the Phase 3 OAK and Phase 2 POPLAR trials for patients with advanced or metastatic non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) reported that bTMB \u22657 Muts/Mb was associated with shorter PFS (2.8 vs. 4.2 months) and OS (7.4 vs. 11.9 months) compared with bTMB <7 Muts/Mb for patients treated with docetaxel (Nie et al., 2020; 32380463). In one study of advanced NSCLC in China, bTMB \u22656 Muts/Mb was associated with decreased PFS (10 vs. 18 months) and OS (11 vs. 25 months) compared with bTMB <6 Muts/Mb for patients treated with platinum_based chemotherapy (Ma et al., 2021; 34055609). A large study of Chinese patients with lung adenocarcinoma reported a shorter median OS for tumors with a higher number of mutations in a limited gene set compared with a lower mutation number (48.4 vs. 61.0 months)(Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843). Another study of patients with NSCLC correlated elevated TMB with poorer prognosis and significantly associated lower TMB in combination with PD_L1 negative status with longer median survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). However, no significant prognostic association of TMB and/or PD_L1 status with survival has been reported in patients with lung SCC (Yu et al., 2019; 30253973, Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). On the basis of clinical evidence in NSCLC and HSNCC, increased bTMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511) and anti_PD_1 (Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074) therapies. In NSCLC, multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 to 16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). In HNSCC, a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Increased tumor mutational burden may predict response to anti_PD_1 (alone or in combination with anti_CTLA_4) or anti_PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Nivolumab", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Nivolumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD_1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD_L1 and PD_L2, reducing inhibition of the antitumor immune response.

Retrospective analysis of the Phase 3 IMpower110 study of first_line atezolizumab for patients with metastatic NSCLC reported improved mOS (11.2 vs. 10.3 months, HR=0.87) and mPFS (5.5 vs. 4.3 months, HR=0.74) compared with chemotherapy for patients with bTMB levels \u226510 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22659 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay), with greater efficacy observed at higher bTMB cutoffs (Herbst et al., 2020; 32997907). Retrospective analysis of the Phase 3 OAK and Phase 2 POPLAR trials for patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC reported atezolizumab significantly improved OS across bTMB levels compared with docetaxel (p=0.0001); patients with bTMB levels \u226510 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22659 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) achieved greater clinical benefit with atezolizumab than those with bTMB <10 Muts/Mb, with greater efficacy observed at higher bTMB cutoffs (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Chen et al., 2019; 31921683); patients with two or more mutations in DNA damage response and repair pathway genes (DDR) had an increased bTMB (20 vs. 7 muts/Mb), and reported a superior durable clinical benefit compared with patients without DDR mutations (57% vs. 31%, p=0.003) (Nie et al., 2020; WCLC Abstract OA07.03). In the first_line setting, the Phase 3 IMpower130, IMpower150, and IMpower132 studies have shown that the addition of atezolizumab to chemotherapy_based regimens significantly improves survival for patients with non_squamous NSCLC without EGFR or ALK alterations (Socinski et al., 2018; 29863955, West et al., 2019; 31122901, Barlesi et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract LBA54).

The Phase 3 IMpower110 study of first_line atezolizumab for patients with metastatic non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) reported improved median OS (20.2 vs. 13.1 months, HR=0.59), median PFS (8.1 vs. 5.0 months), and ORR (38% vs. 29%) compared with chemotherapy for patients whose tumors had high PD_L1 expression and no genomic alterations in EGFR or ALK (Herbst et al., 2020; 32997907).

A Phase 1b/2 study of avelumab combined with the anti_semaphorin 4D antibody pepinemab to treat advanced NSCLC reported an ORR of 24% (5/21) and DCR of 81% for immunotherapy_naive patients, and ORR of 6.9% (2/29) and DCR of 59% for patients who had disease progression on prior immunotherapy treatment (Shafique et al., 2021; 33820783). A study of neoadjuvant avelumab plus chemotherapy to treat early_stage resectable NSCLC reported an ORR of 27% (4/15), which was not considered an enhancement over chemotherapy alone (Tfayli et al., 2020; 32991781). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Durvalumab", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Durvalumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to PD_L1 and blocks its interaction with PD_1 to enhance antitumor immune responses.

In the Phase 3 PACIFIC trial for patients with Stage 3 unresectable non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who did not have progression on chemoradiotherapy, durvalumab monotherapy improved PFS versus placebo across PD_L1 expression subgroups; median PFS (mPFS) was 23.9 versus 5.6 months (HR=0.49) for patients with PD_L1 expression \u22651% and 10.7 versus 5.6 months (HR=0.79) for patients with PD_L1 expression <1%.

The superiority of pembrolizumab over platinum chemotherapy as first_line treatment for patients with PD_L1_positive non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lacking EGFR or ALK alterations was demonstrated in the Phase 3 KEYNOTE_042 and _024 studies, which reported improved median OS (mOS) for PD_L1 tumor proportion scores (TPS) \u22651% (16.7 vs. 12.1 months, HR=0.81) (Mok et al., 2019; 30955977) and \u226550% (26.3 vs. 13.4 months, HR=0.62_0.69) (Brahmer et al., 2020; ESMO LBA51), with estimated 5_year OS rates of 32% versus 16% in the KEYNOTE_024 study (Brahmer et al., 2020; ESMO LBA51). In the Phase 1b KEYNOTE_100 study of pembrolizumab, mOS was numerically higher for patients with NSCLC and PD_L1 TPS \u226550% relative to those with lower levels of PD_L1 expression in both the first_line (35.4 vs. 19.5 months) and previously treated (15.4 vs. 8.5 months) settings (Garon et al., 2019; 31154919). A retrospective study showed that among patients with NSCLC and high PD_L1 expression treated with first_line pembrolizumab, mOS was improved for patients with TPS of 90_100% relative to those with TPS of 50_89% (not reached vs. 15.9 months, HR=0.39) (Aguilar et al., 2019; 31435660). Phase 3 studies showed that the addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy alone in the first_line setting for patients with either non_squamous (KEYNOTE_189) (Gadgeel et al., 2020; 32150489) or squamous (KEYNOTE_407) (Paz_Ares et al., 2018; 30280635, Paz_Ares et al., 2020; 32599071) NSCLC, regardless of PD_L1 or tumor mutational burden (TMB) status (Paz_Ares et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA80); exploratory analysis of KEYNOTE_189 demonstrated superiority of the pembrolizumab combination therapy regardless of blood TMB (bTMB) status (Garassino et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 9521). For the first_line treatment of patients with NSCLC and high PD_L1 expression (TPS \u226550%), a meta_analysis of KEYNOTE_024 and _189 reported the combination of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy to be non_superior to pembrolizumab alone in terms of survival benefit; however, the combination did increase ORR (+22%, p=0.011) (Doherty et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P1.01_16). In the Phase 2/3 KEYNOTE_010 study, pembrolizumab extended mOS relative to docetaxel (10.4_12.7 vs. 8.2 months) for patients with previously treated PD_L1_positive NSCLC (Herbst et al., 2016; 26712084).

CDK4 and its functional homolog CDK6 are activated by D_type cyclins and promote cell cycle progression by inactivating the tumor suppressor Rb (Weinberg et al., 1995; 7736585, Musgrove et al., 2011; 21734724). Amplification of the chromosomal region that includes CDK4 has been reported in multiple cancer types, including lung cancer, glioblastoma, and liposarcoma, and has been associated with overexpression of CDK4 protein (Wikman et al., 2005; 15543620, Rao et al., 2010; 19609742, Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Chung et al., 2009; 19574885, Ragazzini et al., 2004; 15024701, Dujardin et al., 2011; 21336260, Zhang et al., 2013; 23393200, Horvai et al., 2009; 19734852). In the TCGA datasets, CDK4 amplification or mutation occurs in 7% and 1% of lung adenocarcinoma cases, respectively (cBio_Campbell et al., 2016; 27158780); however, neither were detected in any of the lung squamous cell carcinoma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745). CDK4 amplification correlated with high CDK4 gene and protein expression in lung tumors (Wikman et al., 2005; 15543620). High CDK4 protein expression has been detected in 23_47% of non_small cell lung cancers, specifically in 38% (18/47) of lung adenocarcinomas, 44% (4/9) of lung squamous cell carcinomas, and 83% (10/12) of large cell lung cancers (Borczuk et al., 2003; 14578194, Wikman et al., 2005; 15543620, Wu et al., 2011; 21477379). A preclinical study suggests targeting of CDK4 as a potential strategy against KRAS_driven lung adenocarcinomas (Puyol et al., 2010; 20609353). High CDK4 protein expression predicted poor overall survival in patients with lung cancer in one study (Wu et al., 2011; 21477379). CDK4 amplification or activation may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors such as abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib (Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27217383, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767). Clinical benefit has been reported for limited tumor types including patients with CDK4_amplified liposarcoma and sarcoma in response to treatment with abemaciclib (Dickson et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 11004), palbociclib (Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Dickson et al., 2016; 27124835), and ribociclib (Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT03239015", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04594005", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04000529", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03099174", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03994796", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02693535", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02664935", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03297606", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04116541", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "EGFR", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": [{"Name": "T790M", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "T790M"}}, "Interpretation": "EGFR encodes the epidermal growth factor receptor, which belongs to a class of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases. In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). EGFR L858 is located in the kinase domain and is encoded by exon 21. EGFR L858R has been characterized as activating (Lynch et al., 2004; 15118073, Paez et al., 2004; 15118125, Pao et al., 2004; 15329413) and patients with the L858R mutation have been shown to be sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as erlotinib, gefitinib (Lynch et al., 2004; 15118073, Paez et al., 2004; 15118125, Pao et al., 2004; 15329413), and afatinib (Yang et al., 2015; 25589191). The EGFR T790M mutation, when co_occurring with EGFR activating alterations, has been associated with clinical resistance to gefitinib (Sequist et al., 2011; 21430269, Pao et al., 2005; 15737014, Kosaka et al., 2006; 17020982, Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009), erlotinib (Sequist et al., 2011; 21430269, Pao et al., 2005; 15737014, Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009), dacomitinib (Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009, Janne et al., 2011; 21220471, Yu et al., 2017; 29191595, Ercan et al., 2010; 20118985), and afatinib (Wu et al., 2016; 26862733, Nakamura et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P3.13_18), as well as preclinical resistance to lapatinib (Avizienyte et al., 2008; 18588508, Gilmer et al., 2008; 18199554). Rare cases of EGFR T790M without a concurrent activating alteration have been reported (Gazdar et al., 2014; 24736066) and germline T790M mutations have been reported to predispose to familial lung adenocarcinoma (Bell et al., 2005; 16258541, Oxnard et al., 2012; 22588155, Gazdar et al., 2014; 24736066). Limited preclinical data suggests T790M alone is weakly activating, and increased EGFR activity is observed when T790M is expressed with a few known, activating EGFR alterations (Godin_Heymann et al., 2007; 17671201). Therefore, although this alteration has not been fully characterized, it is likely to result in reduced sensitivity to first_ and second_generation EGFR inhibitors. EGFR mutation has been reported in 12_36% of lung adenocarcinomas (Vallee et al., 2013; 23934203, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552) and in 4% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745). EGFR protein expression/overexpression has been reported in up to 70% of NSCLC cases (Watzka et al., 2010; 20353893, Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Grob et al., 2013; 23238037, Park et al., 2012; 22207554, Dobashi et al., 2011; 21040950, Ludovini et al., 2013; 23314677). In addition, expression of EGFR protein has been shown to be higher in lung squamous cell carcinoma samples as compared to lung adenocarcinoma (Skrzypski et al., 2013; 23870818, Kim et al., 2012; 22419022). In a retrospective study of lung adenocarcinoma treated with surgical resection without neoadjuvant TKIs, significantly shorter OS and recurrence_free survival was observed for patients harboring uncommon EGFR mutations (G719X, T790M, or L861R/Q) compared with those harboring only common mutations (L858R or exon 19 deletion) (Hayasaka et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P3.16_03). In patients with lung adenocarcinoma, EGFR mutation was a predictor of poor overall survival (Lee et al., 2013; 23525704, Oakley and Chiosea, 2011; 21587084). However, EGFR mutations have been reported to predict improved survival in patients with resected Stage 1_3 lung adenocarcinoma (Marks et al., 2008; 18303429) or resected Stage 1 NSCLC (Izar et al., 2013; 23932319). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer, EGFR activating mutations may predict sensitivity to EGFR TKIs, including erlotinib (Rosell et al., 2011; 22285168), gefitinib (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064), afatinib (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960), dacomitinib (Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), and osimertinib (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549); however, the data for patients with other tumor types are limited (Hong et al., 2020; 32749686, Kim et al., 2015; 26462025, Kim et al., 2015; 25424851, Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840, Cavalieri et al., 2018; 29734047, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Audet et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 6041). The efficacy of third_generation EGFR inhibitors that selectively target EGFR T790M in non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been confirmed in osimertinib (Yang et al., 2019; 31809241, Yang et al., 2017; 28221867, Goss et al., 2016; 27751847, Janne et al., 2015; 25923549, Auliac et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P1.13_09, Kang et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract MA08.07, Soria et al., 2018; 29151359), D_0316 (Lu et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT170), abivertinib (Zhou et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9091, Wang et al., 2020; 31943845, Ma et al., 2018; 29626621), alflutinib (Shi et al., 2021; 33780662, Shi et al., 2021; DOI: 10.1016/J.JTHO.2021.01.1122), naquotinib (Azuma et al., 2018; 29807396, Kelly et al., 2019; 31070709, Murakami et al., 2018; 29972716, Yu et al., 2017; 28954786), nazartinib (Tan et al., 2020; 31954624), and olmutinib (Park et al., 2021; 33434335, Kim et al., 2019; 31447004). The Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study of amivantamab monotherapy or in combination with lazertinib for the treatment of EGFR_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has produced encouraging preliminary results for treatment_naive patients and patients who relapsed after treatment with osimertinib, including osimertinib_relapsed patients with biomarkers indicating EGFR/MET_based osimertinib resistance (Haura et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9009, Cho et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 1258O, Bauml et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9006). In a Phase 1 trial, the HER3_targeted antibody patritumab deruxtecan elicited an ORR of 39% (22/57, 1 CR) and a median PFS of 8.2 months for patients with non_small cell lung cancer previously treated with an EGFR TKI, many of whom displayed TKI resistance alterations (Janne et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9007). A Phase 1 trial evaluating the EGFR inhibitor AZD3759 reported a reduction in the volume of brain metastases in 40% (8/20) of patients with previously treated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring either the EGFR L858R alteration or EGFR exon 19 deletion, including 3 confirmed PRs and 3 unconfirmed PRs (Ahn et al., 2017; 29056570, Yang et al., 2016; 27928026). In a Phase 1/2 trial for advanced NSCLC, the brain_penetrant third_generation EGFR TKI lazertinib enabled ORRs of 54% (69/127) for all evaluable patients and 44% (8/18, intracranial) for patients with brain metastases (Ahn et al., 2019; 31587882).

A Phase 3 study reported similar efficacy of erlotinib and gefitinib for patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC (Yang et al., 2017; 28103612). Meta_analysis of studies comparing erlotinib or gefitinib versus chemotherapy in the first_line setting reported no significant improvement in OS for patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC; however, the lack of improved OS was attributed to the effectiveness of postprogression salvage therapy (Lee et al., 2017; 28376144).

In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). EGFR L858 is located in the kinase domain and is encoded by exon 21. EGFR L858R has been characterized as activating (Lynch et al., 2004; 15118073, Paez et al., 2004; 15118125, Pao et al., 2004; 15329413) and patients with the L858R mutation have been shown to be sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as erlotinib, gefitinib (Lynch et al., 2004; 15118073, Paez et al., 2004; 15118125, Pao et al., 2004; 15329413), and afatinib (Yang et al., 2015; 25589191). The EGFR T790M mutation, when co_occurring with EGFR activating alterations, has been associated with clinical resistance to gefitinib (Sequist et al., 2011; 21430269, Pao et al., 2005; 15737014, Kosaka et al., 2006; 17020982, Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009), erlotinib (Sequist et al., 2011; 21430269, Pao et al., 2005; 15737014, Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009), dacomitinib (Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009, Janne et al., 2011; 21220471, Yu et al., 2017; 29191595, Ercan et al., 2010; 20118985), and afatinib (Wu et al., 2016; 26862733, Nakamura et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P3.13_18), as well as preclinical resistance to lapatinib (Avizienyte et al., 2008; 18588508, Gilmer et al., 2008; 18199554). Rare cases of EGFR T790M without a concurrent activating alteration have been reported (Gazdar et al., 2014; 24736066) and germline T790M mutations have been reported to predispose to familial lung adenocarcinoma (Bell et al., 2005; 16258541, Oxnard et al., 2012; 22588155, Gazdar et al., 2014; 24736066). Limited preclinical data suggests T790M alone is weakly activating, and increased EGFR activity is observed when T790M is expressed with a few known, activating EGFR alterations (Godin_Heymann et al., 2007; 17671201). Therefore, although this alteration has not been fully characterized, it is likely to result in reduced sensitivity to first_ and second_generation EGFR inhibitors. EGFR mutation has been reported in 12_36% of lung adenocarcinomas (Vallee et al., 2013; 23934203, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552) and in 4% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745). EGFR protein expression/overexpression has been reported in up to 70% of NSCLC cases (Watzka et al., 2010; 20353893, Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Grob et al., 2013; 23238037, Park et al., 2012; 22207554, Dobashi et al., 2011; 21040950, Ludovini et al., 2013; 23314677). In addition, expression of EGFR protein has been shown to be higher in lung squamous cell carcinoma samples as compared to lung adenocarcinoma (Skrzypski et al., 2013; 23870818, Kim et al., 2012; 22419022). In a retrospective study of lung adenocarcinoma treated with surgical resection without neoadjuvant TKIs, significantly shorter OS and recurrence_free survival was observed for patients harboring uncommon EGFR mutations (G719X, T790M, or L861R/Q) compared with those harboring only common mutations (L858R or exon 19 deletion) (Hayasaka et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P3.16_03). In patients with lung adenocarcinoma, EGFR mutation was a predictor of poor overall survival (Lee et al., 2013; 23525704, Oakley and Chiosea, 2011; 21587084). However, EGFR mutations have been reported to predict improved survival in patients with resected Stage 1_3 lung adenocarcinoma (Marks et al., 2008; 18303429) or resected Stage 1 NSCLC (Izar et al., 2013; 23932319). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer, EGFR activating mutations may predict sensitivity to EGFR TKIs, including erlotinib (Rosell et al., 2011; 22285168), gefitinib (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064), afatinib (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960), dacomitinib (Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), and osimertinib (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549); however, the data for patients with other tumor types are limited (Hong et al., 2020; 32749686, Kim et al., 2015; 26462025, Kim et al., 2015; 25424851, Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840, Cavalieri et al., 2018; 29734047, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Audet et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 6041).

The Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study of amivantamab monotherapy or in combination with lazertinib for the treatment of EGFR_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has produced encouraging preliminary results for treatment_naive patients and patients who relapsed after treatment with osimertinib, including osimertinib_relapsed patients with biomarkers indicating EGFR/MET_based osimertinib resistance (Haura et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9009, Cho et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 1258O, Bauml et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9006). In a Phase 1 trial, the HER3_targeted antibody patritumab deruxtecan elicited an ORR of 39% (22/57, 1 CR) and a median PFS of 8.2 months for patients with non_small cell lung cancer previously treated with an EGFR TKI, many of whom displayed TKI resistance alterations (Janne et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9007). A Phase 1 trial evaluating the EGFR inhibitor AZD3759 reported a reduction in the volume of brain metastases in 40% (8/20) of patients with previously treated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring either the EGFR L858R alteration or EGFR exon 19 deletion, including 3 confirmed PRs and 3 unconfirmed PRs (Ahn et al., 2017; 29056570, Yang et al., 2016; 27928026). In a Phase 1/2 trial for advanced NSCLC, the brain_penetrant third_generation EGFR TKI lazertinib enabled ORRs of 54% (69/127) for all evaluable patients and 44% (8/18, intracranial) for patients with brain metastases (Ahn et al., 2019; 31587882). The Phase 3 IMpower150 study showed that the addition of atezolizumab to bevacizumab plus chemotherapy treatment also had clinical efficacy for patients with EGFR_mutated or ALK_rearranged metastatic NSCLC (Socinski et al., 2018; 29863955); therefore, the patient\u2019s clinical context should be considered. The EGFR T790M mutation, when co_occurring with an EGFR activating alteration, confers clinical resistance to gefitinib (Sequist et al., 2011; 21430269, Pao et al., 2005; 15737014, Kosaka et al., 2006; 17020982, Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009), erlotinib (Sequist et al., 2011; 21430269, Pao et al., 2005; 15737014, Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009), afatinib (Wu et al., 2016; 26862733, Tanaka et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P3.13_22, Nakamura et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P3.13_18), and dacomitinib (Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009, Janne et al., 2011; 21220471, Yu et al., 2017; 29191595, Ercan et al., 2010; 20118985).

Meta_analysis of studies comparing erlotinib or gefitinib versus chemotherapy in the first_line setting reported no significant improvement in OS for patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC; however, the lack of improved OS was attributed to the effectiveness of postprogression salvage therapy (Lee et al., 2017; 28376144).

Somatic mutation of KEAP1 occurs in a range of solid tumors, including gastric, hepatocellular, colorectal, and lung cancers (Yoo et al., 2012; 22348534). KEAP1 mutations are rare in hematological malignancies, occurring in fewer than 1% of samples analyzed (COSMIC, 2021)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). In a retrospective analysis of the pan_solid MSKCC dataset, KEAP1 mutation correlated with reduced OS (13.28 vs. 26.53 months) (Xu et al., 2020; 32272498).

In another study, for NSCLC treated with frontline chemotherapy, multivariate analysis showed that KEAP1 and/or NFE2L2 mutations significantly associated with reduced survival for patients with adenocarcinoma (PFS HR=2.34, OS HR=1.96) but not for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (Goeman et al., 2019; 31323387). A study of patients with localized non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) identified pathogenic KEAP1 and NFE2L2 mutations as predictors of local recurrence following radiotherapy but not surgery; limited preclinical data also showed that treatment with a glutaminase inhibitor sensitized KEAP1_mutated NSCLC cells to radiation (Binkley et al., 2020; 33071215). In other preclinical studies, treatment with AKT inhibitors sensitized lung cancer cells harboring KEAP1 or NFE2L2 mutations to both chemotherapy and radiation therapy (Chowdhry et al., 2013; 22964642, Abazeed et al., 2013; 23980093). Mixed clinical data have been reported for the association between KEAP1 mutation and the response to immunotherapy. A pan_cancer study of immunotherapy showed that patients with KEAP1 mutations had shorter OS (10 vs. 20 months) than those without (Chen et al., 2020; 32175433). However, another study across solid tumors showed that KEAP1 mutations were associated with higher tumor mutational burden (TMB) and PD_L1 expression, as well as improved survival outcomes with immunotherapy compared with other treatments (20.0 vs. 11.5 months) (Xu et al., 2020; 32272498). In patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a study of PD_L1 inhibitors showed that patients with concurrent mutation of STK11 and KEAP1 (n=39) experienced significantly shorter PFS (1.6 vs. 2.5 months, HR=1.5) and OS (4 vs. 11 months, HR=1.9) compared with patients with STK11_ and KEAP1_wildtype tumors (n=210) despite significantly higher TMB in the group harboring STK11 and KEAP1 mutations (median 9.4 vs. 6.1 Muts/Mb) (Arbour et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract MA19.09). A retrospective analysis of patients with NSCLC who received immunotherapy reported reduced OS (p=0.040) for patients with KEAP1_ or NFE2L2_mutated tumors (n=69) relative to those with KEAP1_ and NFE2L2_wildtype tumors (n=202) (Zhang et al., 2020; 32471565). A study of immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with lung adenocarcinoma showed that coexisting mutations between KEAP1, PBRM1, SMARCA4, and STK11 were associated with worse OS independent of blood or tissue NGS testing methods (Marinelli et al., 2020; 32866624). An exploratory analysis of a subset of patients with PD_L1_positive NSCLC treated in the first_line setting with pembrolizumab showed similar ORR, PFS, and OS when comparing patients with STK11 or KEAP1 mutations and those without (Cho et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT084). In addition, preclinical data suggest that KEAP1 inactivation increases tumor demand for glutamine and increases tumor sensitivity to glutaminase inhibitors like telaglenastat (Gwinn et al., 2018; 29316436, Sayin et al., 2017; 28967864, Romero et al., 2017; 28967920). Limited clinical data suggest that KEAP1 mutations may predict improved clinical benefit from combinations of glutaminase inhibitors and anti_PD_1 inhibitors (Skoulidis et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract TPS9627); a Phase 1/2 study of the glutaminase inhibitor telaglenastat (CB_839) plus nivolumab for the treatment of advanced NSCLC reported better clinical benefit rates and median PFS for patients with KEAP1 mutation (75% [3/4] vs. 15% [2/13], 6.4 vs. 3.7 months), KRAS mutation (38% [3/8] vs. 20% [2/10], 4.5 vs. 3.7 months), or KEAP1 and KRAS concurrent mutations (100% [2/2] vs. 13% [1/8], 7.2 vs. 3.7 months) compared with patients without these mutations (Skoulidis et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract TPS9627). KEAP1 mutation has also been identified as a potential biomarker for sensitivity to combined AKT and TXNRD1 inhibition in lung cancer (Dai et al., 2013; 23824739).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "KEAP1 inactivation may predict sensitivity to glutaminase inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT03872427", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04250545", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "MDM2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "true", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "MDM2 encodes an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p53, Rb1, and other proteins (Sdek et al., 2005; 16337594, Brady et al., 2005; 15632057, Li et al., 2004; 15053880). MDM2 acts to prevent the activity of the tumor suppressor p53; therefore, overexpression or amplification of MDM2 may be oncogenic (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675, Cordon_Cardo et al., 1994; 8306343). Overexpression or amplification of MDM2 is frequent in cancer (Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). Although two retrospective clinical studies suggest that MDM2 amplification may predict a short time_to_treatment failure on anti_PD_1/PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors, with 4/5 patients with MDM2 amplification (Kato et al., 2017; 28351930) and 2/3 patients with MDM2 or MDM4 amplification (Singavi et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 1140PD) experiencing tumor hyperprogression, amplification of MDM2 or MDM4 was not associated with shorter progression_free survival (PFS) in a retrospective analysis of non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) outcomes with immune checkpoint inhibitors (hazard ratio of 1.4, p=0.44)(Rizvi et al., 2018; 29337640). The latter study reported PFS of >2 months for 5/8 patients with MDM2/MDM4 amplification (Rizvi et al., 2018; 29337640). In the TCGA datasets, amplification of MDM2 has been reported in 8% of lung adenocarcinoma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552) and 2% of lung squamous cell carcinoma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745). Separate studies have reported MDM2 amplification at similar incidences of 6_7% in non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), mainly in patients with adenocarcinoma, but a higher incidence of 21% (24/116) has also been observed, with amplification found in various NSCLC subtypes (Higashiyama et al., 1997; 9155050, Marchetti et al., 1995; 7551299, Dworakowska et al., 2004; 15165086). The role of MDM2 expression/amplification as a prognostic marker is complex, with some studies showing a negative and others a positive effect on survival in patients with NSCLC (Onel and Cordon_Cardo, 2004; 14757840, Dworakowska et al., 2004; 15165086, Higashiyama et al., 1997; 9155050, Ren et al., 2013; 24175836). MDM2 antagonists disrupt the MDM2_p53 interaction, thereby stabilizing p53 (Cheok et al., 2011; 20975744). Preclinical studies have suggested that the amplification of MDM2, in the absence of concurrent TP53 mutations, may increase sensitivity to these agents (Ohnstad et al., 2013; 23165797, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357). Preliminary Phase 1 studies of the MDM2_p53 antagonist alrizomadlin (APG_115) reported a PR in a patient with liposarcoma harboring an MDM2 amplification and wildtype for TP53 and SD in 21%\u201338% (6/28 and 5/13, respectively) of patients in genomically unselected solid tumors (Zhang et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3124, Rasco et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3126). A Phase 2 trial of alrizomadlin in combination with pembrolizumab reported a PR in 1 of 3 patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor that had failed standard therapy, as well as PRs in patients with multiple types of solid tumors that had failed immunotherapy, including 1 out of 14 patients with non_small cell lung cancer; 1 out of 5 patients with urothelial carcinoma; and 2 out of5, 1 out of 5, and 1 out of 11 patients with mucosal, uveal, and cutaneous melanoma, respectively (Tolcher et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 2506). Phase 1b studies of the MDM2 inhibitor idasanutlin for refractory AML in combination with cytarabine or venetoclax reported anti_leukemic response rates of 33% (25/75) and 37% (11/30), respectively (Martinelli et al., 2016; EHA21 Abstract S504, Daver et al., 2018; ASH Abstract 767); clinical benefit (58% ORR, 7/12) with idasanutlin monotherapy has been reported for patients with polycythemia vera (Mascarenhas et al., 2019; ASH Abstract 134). The dual MDM2/MDM4 inhibitor ALRN_6924 led to an ORR of 27% (4/15) for patients with TP53 wildtype peripheral T_cell lymphoma in a Phase 2 study (Shustov et al., 2018; ASH Abstract 1623); responses have also been observed in TP53 wildtype AML, MDS, Merkel cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and liposarcoma (Sallman et al., 2018; ASH Abstract 4066, Meric_Bernstam et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 2505).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Inhibitors of the MDM2_p53 interaction are being tested in clinical trials.

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI_H is generally infrequent in NSCLC, reported in fewer than 1% of samples across several large studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197, Ninomiya et al., 2006; 16641899, Vanderwalde et al., 2018; 29436178, Zang et al., 2019; 31270941, Dudley et al., 2016; 26880610, Takamochi et al., 2017; 28676214, Schrock et al., 2017; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2016.11.487), whereas data on the reported incidence of MSI_H in SCLC has been limited and conflicting (Pylkkanen et al., 1997; 9329646, Gonzalez et al., 2000; 11061602, Chen et al., 1996; 8782463, Merlo et al., 1994; 8174113). One study reported MSI_H in lung adenocarcinoma patients with smoking history, and 3 of 4 MSI_H patients examined also had metachronous carcinomas in other organs, although this has not been investigated in large scale studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of MSI in NSCLC are limited (PubMed, Oct 2021). On the basis of prospective clinical evidence in multiple solid tumor types, microsatellite instability (MSI) and associated increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) (Jass, 2007; 17204026, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894) may predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the approved PD_1_targeting agents cemiplimab, dostarlimab, nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab), and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2017; 28734759, Overman et al., 2018; 29355075, Overman et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 635, Lipson et al., 2013; 23169436, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Oaknin et al., 2020; 33001143) and PD_L1_targeting agents atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (Hochster et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 673, Fleming et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 5585, Bang et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 92). As the MSI status of this tumor is unknown, the relevance of these therapeutic approaches is unclear. While approximately 80% of MSI_H tumors arise due to somatic inactivation of an MMR pathway protein, about 20% arise due to germline mutations in one of the MMR genes (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942), which are associated with a condition known as Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC) (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756). Lynch syndrome leads to an increased risk of colorectal, endometrial, gastric, and other cancers (Lynch et al., 2009; 19659756, Pande et al., 2012; 22714864, Kastrinos and Syngal, 2007; 17920897) and has an estimated prevalence in the general population ranging from 1:600 to 1:2000 (Silva et al., 2009; 19466295, Sehgal et al., 2014; 24978665, de la Chapelle et al., 2005; 16136383).

The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with high tumor fraction values have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus higher sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at a lower risk of false negative results (Li et al., 2021; AACR Abstract 2231). However, if tumor fraction is not detected as high, it does not exclude the presence of disease burden or compromise the confidence of reported alterations. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels. In the research setting, changes in tumor fraction estimates have been associated with treatment duration and clinical response and may be a useful indicator for future cancer management (Bronkhorst
