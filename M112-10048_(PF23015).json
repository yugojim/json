Germline mutations or deletions affecting FANCA have been reported in 26_65% of patients with Fanconi anemia (FA), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital abnormalities, bone marrow failure, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, and predisposition to a subset of cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, gynecological malignancies, and head and neck tumors (Alter, 2014; 25455269, Kee and D Andrea, 2012; 23114602, Rosenberg et al., 2008; 18322251, Khincha and Savage, 2013; 24246701, Chandrasekharappa et al., 2013; 23613520, Selenti et al., 2013; 23898106, Park et al., 2013; 23067021, Chen et al., 2007; 17221219). Frequency estimates suggest an incidence of 3:1,000,000 individuals in Europe and the US, and a heterozygote carrier frequency of 1:181 to 1:300 in the US and Europe, respectively, with slightly higher rates for some populations, such as the Ashkenazi Jewish population (1:89) (Tischkowitz and Hodgson, 2003; 12525534, Khincha and Savage, 2013; 24246701). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt FANCA function or expression (Li et al., 2018; 29702541, Castella et al., 2011; 21273304, Qian et al., 2013; 24349332, Benitez et al., 2014; 24170812, Kruyt et al., 1999; 10567393, Folias et al., 2002; 12354784, Lightfoot et al., 1999; 10332032, Ali et al., 2012; 22343915, Yan et al., 2012; 22705371, Leung et al., 2012; 22396592, Matsuoka et al., 2007; 17525332, Collins et al., 2009; 19109555, Shukla et al., 2013; 23370339, Otsuki et al., 2001; 11726552). FANCA mutations and deletion have been reported at low frequencies (<2.5%) across solid tumors (Zehir et al., 2017; 28481359, Nguyen et al., 2022; 35120664). In some patient populations, germline polymorphisms specifically in FANCA have been linked to an increased risk of esophageal, breast, cervical, and bladder cancer (Akbari et al., 2011; 21279724, Haiman et al., 2008; 18056155, Michiels et al., 2009; 19237606, Wang et al., 2009; 19012493). A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in FANCA has been correlated with inferior PFS and OS for patients with melanoma (Yin et al., 2015; 25243787), whereas methylation of FANCA correlated with inferior prognosis in high_grade serous ovarian carcinoma (Dai et al., 2013; 23965899). However, the link between FANCA expression and function has either not been explored, or not correlated with outcome, in these studies and other studies have failed to link FANCA polymorphisms with the risk of breast or cervical cancer (Barroso et al., 2009; 19536649, Juko_Pecirep et al., 2011; 21543111). Low expression of FANCA has been correlated with inferior prognosis in univariate but not multivariate analysis in breast cancer (Ribeiro et al., 2013; 23825533). FANCA has been reported to be downregulated in higher versus lower grade ovarian cancer, but FANCA expression did not impact OS or PFS (Ganzinellie et al., 2011; 21216588). Gain of 16q, associated with increased copy number of FANCA, correlated with decreased PFS (Bauer et al., 2008; 18810378). Inactivation of the FA/BRCA pathway sensitizes cells to mitomycin C and cisplatin (Villarroel et al., 2011; 21135251, Pennington et al., 2014; 24240112, Wang and Gautier, 2010; 20807115, Ghosh et al., 2014; 24200853) and results in increased sensitivity of glioma cells to alkylating agents such as temozolomide (Chen et al., 2007; 17221219). There are no therapies that directly target defects in the FA complex. Clinical evidence in prostate (Mateo et al., 2020; 31806540, Abida et al., 2020; 3208634, Mateo et al., 2015; 26510020, Smith et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract LBA50), breast (Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006), and ovarian cancers (Swisher et al., 2017; 27908594), including multiple patient responses, indicates that FANCA inactivation may confer sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. Inactivation of the FA/BRCA pathway sensitizes cells to mitomycin C and cisplatin (Villarroel et al., 2011; 21135251, Pennington et al., 2014; 24240112, Wang and Gautier, 2010; 20807115, Ghosh et al., 2014; 24200853) and results in increased sensitivity of glioma cells to alkylating agents such as temozolomide (Chen et al., 2007; 17221219).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "FANCA alterations may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT03869190", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04123366", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03742895", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02264678", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05035745", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03772561", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04497116", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03297606", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04991480", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "FBXW7", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "E471G", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "37.57", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "E471G"}}, "Interpretation": "FBXW7 encodes the F_box protein subunit of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets proteins for degradation (Welcker and Clurman, 2008; 18094723). FBXW7 inactivation is associated with chromosomal instability and with stabilization of proto_oncogenes, such as mTOR, MYC, cyclin E, NOTCH, and JUN; FBXW7 is therefore considered a tumor suppressor (Akhoondi et al., 2007; 17909001, Welcker and Clurman, 2008; 18094723). Although alterations such as seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. In the bladder urothelial carcinoma TCGA dataset, FBXW7 mutations were detected in 8.7% of cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014; 24476821). Another study identified FBXW7 mutation in 4.3% (2/47) of bladder urothelial carcinomas and in 13% (2/16) of non_bladder urothelial carcinomas (Millis et al., 2015; 25178641). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of FBXW7 alterations in urothelial carcinoma are limited (PubMed, Jul 2022). Reduced FBXW7 expression has been associated with poor prognosis in some cancers such as colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, esophageal SCC, cervical SCC, melanoma, and non_small cell lung carcinoma (Tu et al., 2012; 22548670, Iwatsuki et al., 2010; 19739118, Yokobori et al., 2012; 22576686, Yokobori et al., 2009; 19366810, Yokobori et al., 2014; 24165483, Rajagopalan et al., 2004; 14999283, Cheng et al., 2013; 23381582, Xu et al., 2016; 26954701). FBXW7 inactivating alterations may indicate sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors (Mao et al., 2008; 18787170, Yang et al., 2015; 25749036). Case series reported objective responses for 2 patients with FBXW7_mutated cervical squamous cell carcinoma treated with everolimus (Kulkarni et al., 2020; SGO Abstract 356).

TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB level that may be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors in urothelial carcinoma (Galsky et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 848PD, Necchi et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT003, Rosenberg et al., 2016; 26952546, Balar et al., 2017; 27939400, Powles et al., 2018; 29268948, Mariathasan et al., 2018; 29443960, Miao et al., 2018; 30150660, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Sarid et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 938, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526). In the Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma TCGA dataset, the median somatic mutation burden was 5.5 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014; 24476821). One study reported that the number of somatic mutations positively correlates with increased tumor stage and grade of bladder cancers (Cazier et al., 2016; 24777035). For patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma receiving atezolizumab, however, higher median mutation load has been reported to be significantly associated with improved PFS and OS (Rosenberg et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 104, Rosenberg et al., 2016; 26952546, Balar et al., 2017; 27939400). Another study for patients with urothelial bladder carcinoma showed that high tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with superior OS and disease_specific survival compared with low TMB; the OS benefit of high TMB was driven by the cohort with Stage 3 disease, whereas OS was similar between low and high TMB for patients with Stage 2 or Stage 4 disease (Voutsadakis, 2022; 35323317). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors in urothelial carcinoma, higher TMB has corresponded with clinical benefit from treatment with anti_PD_L1 (Rosenberg et al., 2016; 26952546, Balar et al., 2017; 27939400, Powles et al., 2018; 29268948, Mariathasan et al., 2018; 29443960, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Miao et al., 2018; 30150660) and anti_PD_1 immunotherapeutic agents (Galsky et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 848PD, Necchi et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT003). For patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma treated with the PD_L1 inhibitor atezolizumab, those with a significantly increased mutational load (9.7 Muts/Mb or greater by this assay or others) were associated with response and longer OS compared with those with lower TMB (Rosenberg et al., 2016; 26952546, Powles et al., 2018; 29268948, Balar et al., 2017; 27939400, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254). Similarly, in a study of pembrolizumab in muscle invasive bladder cancer, the median TMB in responders was 12.3 Muts/Mb, versus 7.0 Muts/Mb in nonresponding patients (Necchi et al., 2018; AACR Abstract CT003). The PD_1 inhibitor nivolumab led to increased ORR, PFS, and OS for patients with a TMB of 167 missense mutations/tumor or higher (~ equivalency = 9 Muts/Mb or higher as measured by this assay) compared with those harboring lower TMB in a study of metastatic urothelial cancer (Galsky et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 848PD).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Increased tumor mutational burden may predict response to anti_PD_1 (alone or in combination with anti_CTLA_4) or anti_PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Cemiplimab", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Cemiplimab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD_1 receptor and blocks its interaction with the ligands PD_L1 and PD_L2 to enhance antitumor immune responses.

The chromosomal rearrangement t(8;16)(p11;p13) is characteristic of the M4/M5 subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and results in a chimeric gene fusing MYST3/MOZ (a gene essential for the development of the hematopoietic system and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells) to CREBBP (Borrow et al., 1996; 8782817). CREBBP_BCORL1 fusion has been reported in patients with ossifying fibromyxoid tumors (Kao et al., 2017; 27537276, Hofvander et al., 2020; 31932680). CREBBP mutations have been observed at high frequency in follicular lymphoma (FL, 26%) and diffuse large B_cell lymphoma (DLBCL, 16%), and at lower frequency in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, 7%), and tumors of the urinary tract (15%), skin (12%), liver (8.7%), endometrium (8.5%), and stomach (8.2%)(COSMIC, 2023)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). These mutations include missense substitutions clustered in the CREBBP histone acetyltransferase domain and truncating mutations throughout the gene sequence, suggesting a role for CREBBP inactivation in these diseases. CREBBP mutations have been reported to occur in the transition from prostate acinar carcinoma to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (Grasso et al., 2015; 25735316), which may indicate significance for CREBBP in SCC. In two cases of relapsed pediatric B_cell ALL, CREBBP mutation conferred resistance to glucocorticoid therapy (Ma et al., 2015; 25790293). Reports have found CREBBP mutation in 62_68% of patients with FL (Green et al., 2015; 25713363, Loeffler et al., 2015; 25027518), which was associated with immune evasion (Green et al., 2015; 25713363). AML with MYST3/CREBBP fusion was reported to occur in 60_80% of cases 9_72 months after adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer and was associated with a poor prognosis (Gervais et al., 2008; 18528428, Haferlach et al., 2009; 19194466). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in CREBBP. The use of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are being investigated in clinical trials that are recruiting patients with either lymphoma or urothelial carcinoma harboring CREBBP alterations. However, it has been reported that there is no correlation between CREBBP mutation status and response to HDAC inhibitors in DLBCL (Mensah et al., 2015; 25671298).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "KDM6A", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "A516fs*17", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "11.64", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "A516fs*17"}}, "Interpretation": "KDM6A encodes a histone H3 lysine 27 demethylase UTX, which functions as a transcriptional regulator (van Haaften et al., 2009; 19330029). A significant number of inactivating KDM6A mutations have been found across multiple tumor types, suggesting a role as a tumor suppressor (van Haaften et al., 2009; 19330029). KDM6A mutations have been reported in 3.9% of samples analyzed, with the highest incidence in tumors of the urinary tract (31%), liver (7.3%), endometrium (6.7%), salivary gland (6.0%), and pancreas (5.1%) (COSMIC, Jan 2023)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878).

KDM6A inactivation has been found as a recurrent tumorigenic event in male T_cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T_ALL), and loss of KDM6A increased the sensitivity of T_ALL cells to therapies targeting histone H3 lysine 27 methylation in preclinical assays (Van der Meulen et al., 2014; 25320243). However, KDM6A overexpression has been noted in breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma, and correlated with inferior prognosis in patients with breast cancer (Wang et al., 2013; 23792809, Kim et al., 2014; 24491801, Shen et al., 2012; 23057811).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI has been detected in 26_49% of urothelial carcinomas (Mylona et al., 2008; 18254781, Amira et al., 2003; 14501713); MSI_H has also been reported in multiple case studies of upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (Bai et al., 2013; 23690119). Microsatellite instability (MSI), as determined through loss of MSH2 or MSH6 protein expression, correlated with noninvasive well_differentiated bladder tumors and favorable OS (Mylona et al., 2008; 18254781). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "RB1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "S576*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "20.73", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "S576*"}}, "Interpretation": "RB1 encodes the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), a tumor suppressor and negative regulator of the cell cycle (Burkhart and Sage, 2008; 18650841, Knudsen and Knudsen, 2008; 19143056).

RB1 mutations have been reported in 80% (49/61) of bladder small cell carcinomas (Chang et al., 2018; 29180607). RB1 mutations have been detected in 10_20% of bladder urothelial carcinomas, including transitional cell carcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014; 24476821, cBio_Guo et al., 2013; 24121792, cBio_Kim et al., 2014; 25092538) and in up to 5.4% (2/37) of upper tract urothelial carcinomas (cBio_Robinson et al., 2019; 31278255, cBio_Su et al., 2021; 33397444, cBio_Sfakianos et al., 2015; 26278805). Recurrent focal genomic deletion of RB1 has been reported in urothelial carcinomas (Lindgren et al., 2012; 22685613). Expression of Rb has been reported in 47_52% of bladder urothelial carcinomas in one study, and was found to correlate with RB1 alteration (Diaz_Cano et al., 2000; 10744064). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of RB1 alterations in bladder neuroendocrine carcinomas are limited (PubMed, Nov 2022). Loss of Rb expression has been suggested to play a role in the progression of urothelial cancers, and has been associated with advanced tumor stage and poor patient survival (Ishikawa et al., 1991; 1913692, Logothetis et al., 1992; 1640485, Cordon_Cardo et al., 1992; 1640484). On the basis of limited clinical data (Owonikoko et al., 2016; ESMO Abstract 14230) and strong preclinical data (Hook et al., 2012; 22222631, Gong et al., 2019; 30373917, Oser et al., 2019; 30373918, Yang et al., 2022; 34741392), RB1 inactivation may be associated with sensitivity to inhibitors of Aurora kinase A, particularly in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). A clinical study evaluating the Aurora kinase A inhibitor alisertib for patients with prostate cancer did not find an association between RB1 deletion and clinical benefit (Beltran et al., 2019; 30232224). Other approaches to target RB1 inactivation under investigation in preclinical studies include inhibitors of BCL_2 family members (Allaman_Pillet et al., 2013; 21955141) and activation of the NOTCH pathway (Viatour et al., 2011; 21875955). Loss of Rb function has been associated with increased sensitivity to cytotoxic agents and chemotherapeutics in both preclinical studies and in patients with bladder or breast cancer (Derenzini et al., 2008; 18381962, Knudsen and Knudsen, 2008; 19143056). Mutations in RB1 underlie the development of retinoblastoma (RB), a rare tumor that arises at a rate of approximately 1:20,000 live births, with nearly 5,000 new cases worldwide per year (Chen et al., 2014; 24282159). Germline mutations in RB1 account for approximately 40% of RB tumors (Yun et al., 2011; 22553621) and are associated with an increased risk of developing secondary malignancies that include soft tissue and bone sarcoma and malignant melanoma (Houston et al., 2011; 21139478, Ng et al., 2010; 19959033). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of RB1 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "STAG2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "M1I", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "29.17", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "M1I"}}, "Interpretation": "STAG2 encodes a subunit of the cohesin complex, which maintains sister chromatid cohesion. The cohesin complex includes four subunits: SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21, and either STAG1 or STAG2 (Solomon et al., 2014; 24856830). Cohesin is also involved in transcriptional regulation, DNA replication and DNA repair (Solomon et al., 2014; 24856830). STAG2 mutations, which are mostly truncating, or loss of STAG2 protein expression have been reported in multiple cancer types (Kandoth et al., 2013; 24132290, Solomon et al., 2014; 24856830). STAG2 deletion has been shown to promote tumorigenesis in preclinical studies (Evers et al., 2014; 24484537), and STAG2 inactivation has been proposed to promote tumorigenesis via a mechanism that involves increased aneuploidy (Guo et al., 2013; 24121792, Solomon et al., 2013; 24121789, Solomon et al., 2011; 21852505) or altered transcriptional regulation (Thota et al., 2014; 25006131, Balb\u00e1s_Mart\u00ednez et al., 2013; 24121791, Kon et al., 2013; 23955599, Taylor et al., 2014; 24270882). STAG2 mutations have been observed most frequently in urothelial bladder carcinoma (16_35%) (Solomon et al., 2013; 24121789, Balbas_Martinez et al., 2013; 24121791, Guo et al., 2013; 24121792, Taylor et al., 2014; 24270882, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014; 24476821), Ewing sarcoma (13_22%) (Tirode et al., 2014; 25223734, Brohl et al., 2014; 25010205), upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (11%) (Hoang et al., 2013; 23926200), myeloid malignancies (6%) (Thota et al., 2014; 25006131, Kon et al., 2013; 23955599), and glioblastoma (6%) (Solomon et al., 2011; 21852505). STAG2 truncation mutations are associated with loss of protein expression (Solomon et al., 2013; 24121789, Balbas_Martinez et al., 2013; 24121791, Taylor et al., 2014; 24270882, Brohl et al., 2014; 25010205). In patients with Ewing sarcoma, STAG2 and TP53 mutations often co_occur and are associated with decreased OS, although mutation of either STAG2 or TP53 alone was not demonstrated to affect survival (Tirode et al., 2014; 25223734, Brohl et al., 2014; 25010205). STAG2 mutation in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome is associated with decreased OS and has also been associated with increased response to treatment with azacitidine or decitabine in patients with myeloid malignancies (Thota et al., 2014; 25006131). The data on the prognostic significance of STAG2 mutation or loss of STAG2 protein expression in the context of urothelial bladder carcinoma are conflicting (Solomon et al., 2013; 24121789, Balbas_Martinez et al., 2013; 24121791, Guo et al., 2013; 24121792, Taylor et al., 2014; 24270882). In patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, loss of STAG2 staining was significantly associated with decreased OS but was also associated with survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy (Evers et al., 2014; 24484537). An inactivating STAG2 mutation was identified in a patient with melanoma that acquired resistance to vemurafenib and preclinical evidence suggests that loss of STAG2 expression decreases the sensitivity of BRAF V600E_positive melanoma cells to vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and trametinib (Shen et al., 2016; 27500726). There are no therapies that directly target STAG2. However, in preclinical studies, STAG2 inactivation by mutation or knockdown resulted in increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Bailey et al., 2014; 24356817) or oxaliplatin (Evers et al., 2014; 24484537).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TERT", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "promoter _124C>T", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "47.64", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "promoter _124C>T"}}, "Interpretation": "Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT, or hTERT) is a catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex, which is required to maintain appropriate chromosomal length (Shay et al., 2011; 22015685).

Mutations within the promoter region of TERT that confer enhanced TERT promoter activity have been reported in two hotspots, located at _124 bp and _146 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (also termed C228T and C250T, respectively)(Horn et al., 2013; 23348503, Huang et al., 2014; 23348506, Vinagre et al., 2013; 23887589), as well as tandem mutations at positions \u2013124/\u2013125 bp and \u2013138/\u2013139 bp (Horn et al., 2013; 23348503). In 1 study, TERT promoter mutations were reported in all 11 urinary bladder small cell cancers analyzed (Zheng et al., 2014; 25042800). One study reported TERT promoter mutations in 67% (14/21) of high_grade and in 56% (34/61) of low_grade bladder carcinomas (Vinagre et al., 2013; 23887589). Another study reported that 85% (44/52) of all bladder cancer samples harbored a TERT promoter mutation (Liu et al., 2013; 23603989). For patients with bladder urothelial carcinoma, both TERT promoter mutations and increased TERT expression associate with poor prognosis, although carrying an additional germline alteration at _245 (rs2853669) may confer a better prognosis (Kinde et al., 2013; 24121487, Rachakonda et al., 2013; 24101484, Borah et al., 2015; 25722414). In urothelial cancer, the prognostic significance of TERT promoter mutation in clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is unclear; 1 study reported an association between TERT promoter mutations and improved median OS from ICIs (n=78) (Kouchkovsky et al., 2021; 33980590), but another study observed no such relationship (n=166)(Chawla et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 561). Therapeutic options for targeting tumors with TERT mutations are limited, although a variety of approaches have been investigated, including immunotherapies using TERT as a tumor_associated antigen and antisense oligonucleotide_ or peptide_based therapies. TERT peptide vaccines showed limited anticancer efficacy in clinical trials (Zanetti et al., 2017; 27245281); however, in one preclinical study, the combination of a TERT peptide vaccine and anti_CTLA_4 therapy suppressed tumor growth (Duperret at al., 2018; 29249395).

TP53 mutation was detected in 90% (55/61) of small cell carcinoma of the bladder in a study (Chang et al., 2018; 29180607). Similarly, in one genomic analysis of 132 bladder cancer specimens that harbored a small cell component, TP53 mutations were identified in 92% of samples (Hoffman_Censits et al., 2021; 32061548). TP53 mutation has been reported in 49\u201354% of bladder urothelial carcinoma (UC) (Ross et al., 2013; 23887298, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014; 24476821), 33% of renal pelvis UC (Bringuier et al., 1998; 9761125), and 25% (22/71) of ureter UC samples (Furihata et al., 2000; 10675480).

TP53 mutations in both bladder and renal pelvis urothelial carcinoma (UC) are more common in invasive tumors (Bringuier et al., 1998; 9761125, Goebell and Knowles, 2010; 20610279, Lindgren et al., 2012; 22685613, Kim et al., 2014; 25092538), and have been associated with inferior survival in patients with renal pelvis UC (Bringuier et al., 1998; 9761125) or upper tract UC (UTUC) (Feng et al., 2014; 24500328). Alterations to the p53 pathway are correlated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in bladder cancer (Eissa et al., 2010; 20012564, Mitra et al., 2007; 17710407, Lambrou et al., 2013; 23624844), and p53 overexpression has been linked to poor progression_free survival in UTUC (Lee et al., 2013; 23482786, Feng et al., 2014; 24500328), disease progression in UC of the renal pelvis and ureter (Hashimoto et al., 2000; 11168685), and higher tumor grade in bladder squamous cell carcinoma (Osman et al., 1997; 9815716, Helal et al., 2006; 16998598, Jalali et al., 2011; 22126554). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "FANCA", "Alteration": "A778fs*45", "Title": "A Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Multiple Immunotherapy_based Treatment Combinations in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma After Failure With Platinum_Containing Chemotherapy", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1/2", "Target": "CD38, PARP, CD47, PD_L1, Nectin_4, IL_6R", "Locations": "Taipei City (Taiwan), Huwei Township (Taiwan), Tainan (Taiwan), Kaohsiung City (Taiwan), Seoul (Korea, Republic of), Athens (Greece), London (United Kingdom), Sutton (United Kingdom), Oxford (United Kingdom), Caen (France)", "NCTID": "NCT03869190", "Note": "FANCA alterations may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "FANCA", "Alteration": "A778fs*45", "Title": "Study of Olaparib (MK_7339) in Combination With Pembrolizumab (MK_3475) in the Treatment of Homologous Recombination Repair Mutation (HRRm) and/or Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD)_Positive Advanced Cancer (MK_7339_007/KEYLYNK_007)", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "PARP, PD_1", "Locations": "Fukuoka (Japan), Seongnam_si (Korea, Republic of), Seoul (Korea, Republic of), Okayama (Japan), Nagoya (Japan), Tokyo (Japan), Kashiwa (Japan), Sapporo (Japan), Nedlands (Australia), Southport (Australia)", "NCTID": "NCT04123366", "Note": "FANCA alterations may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "FANCA", "Alteration": "A778fs*45", "Title": "Efficacy and Safety of Olaparib (MK_7339) in Participants With Previously Treated, Homologous Recombination Repair Mutation (HRRm) or Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD) Positive Advanced Cancer (MK_7339_002 / LYNK_002)", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "PARP", "Locations": "Seongnam_si (Korea, Republic of), Seoul (Korea, Republic of), Darlinghurst (Australia), Adana (Turkey), Jerusalem (Israel), Konya (Turkey), Ramat Gan (Israel), Istanbul (Turkey), Antalya (Turkey), Brasov (Romania)", "NCTID": "NCT03742895", "Note": "FANCA alterations may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "FANCA", "Alteration": "A778fs*45", "Title": "Ascending Doses of AZD6738 in Combination With Chemotherapy and/or Novel Anti Cancer Agents", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1/2", "Target": "ATR, PARP, PD_L1", "Locations": "Seongnam_si (Korea, Republic of), Seoul (Korea, Republic of), Goyang_si (Korea, Republic of), Cambridge (United Kingdom), Withington (United Kingdom), Manchester (United Kingdom), London (United Kingdom), Coventry (United Kingdom), Sutton (United Kingdom), Oxford (United Kingdom)", "NCTID": "NCT02264678", "Note": "FANCA alterations may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "FANCA", "Alteration": "A778fs*45", "Title": "Selinexor & Talazoparib in Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors;
