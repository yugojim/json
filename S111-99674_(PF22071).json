These kinases function downstream of RAS as part of the MAPK (RAF_MEK_ERK) signaling cascade that facilitates cell proliferation, survival and transformation (Holderfield et al., 2014; 24957944, Burotto et al., 2014; 24948110). BRAF mutations have been reported in up to 20% of all cancers, with the majority of mutations occurring at the V600 position (Davies et al., 2002; 12068308, Kandoth et al., 2013; 24132290). BRAF amplification has been reported and correlated with overexpression of the BRAF protein in various tumor types (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tanami et al., 2004; 15467732, Modrek et al., 2009; 19671679, Ciampi et al., 2005; 16199894). Expression of the BRAF kinase domain without the N_terminal auto_inhibitory domain, whether with or without a fusion partner, is a BRAF class 2 subtype and has been shown to be constitutively active and to drive hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway, exhibiting transforming activity (Seivert et al., 2013; 23533272, Pouliakos et al., 2011; 22113612, Botton et al., 2013; 23890088, Ciampi et al., 2005; 15630448, Cin et al., 2011; 21424530, Dahiya et al., 2012; 22548077, Lin et al., 2012; 22157620, Tian et al., 2011; 21884820, Forshew et al., 2009; 19373855, Jones et al., 2008; 18974108, Tran et al., 2005; 15710605, Baitei et al., 2009; 19156774, Gronych et al., 2011; 21403401) in a manner sensitive to MEK inhibitors (Chmielecki et al., 2014; 25266736, Hutchinson et al., 2013; 24345920, Rizos et al., 2014; 24463458, Hartsough et al., 2014; 24520098, Carlino et al., 2014; 24476679, Baitei et al., 2009; 19156774), ERK inhibitors (Carlino et al., 2014; 24476679), the pan_RAF inhibitor sorafenib (Botton et al., 2013; 23890088, Gronych et al., 2011; 21403401), and second_generation BRAF inhibitors PLX8394 and PLX7904 (Choi et al., 2014; 24283590, Basile et al., 2014; 24422853). Some patients with BRAF fusions have been reported to benefit from MEK inhibitors (Fangusaro et al., 2019; 31151904, Ross et al., 2015; 26314551, Menzies et al., 2015; 26072686, Grisham et al., 2015; 26324360, Chmielecki et al., 2014; 25266736, Banerjee et al., 2017; 28339824) as well as pan_RAF inhibitor sorafenib (Subbiah et al., 2014; 24422672, Botton et al., 2013; 23890088, Passeron et al., 2011; 22092579, Karajannis et al., 2014; 24803676). Rearrangements, such as observed here, are predicted to be activating and oncogenic. Rearrangements such as observed here, those that are detected as a reciprocal fusion, are not clearly in frame, or may lack a fusion partner, may be indicative of an activating rearrangement event such as a fusion or an expression of the BRAF kinase domain without the N_terminal auto_inhibitory domain; however, it is unclear whether such rearrangements would lead to an oncogenic BRAF variant. Rearrangements, such as observed here, detected as a deletion of the kinase domain or a duplication of a non_kinase portion of the protein may lead to the production of an oncogenic product such as a fusion or expression of the kinase domain lacking the N_terminal autoinhibitory region; however, it is unclear whether such events would lead to a production of an oncogenic variant. Rearrangements, such as observed here, may produce a chimeric protein and/or overexpress a variant that includes both a portion of the BRAF N_terminal autoinhibitory domain (Tran et al., 2005; 15710605) and the BRAF kinase domain. Unlike other activating BRAF variants, which lack the autoinhibitory domain, it is not known whether the rearranged protein potentially produced here constitutively activates BRAF kinase. Some BRAF rearrangements are also thought to result in BRAF overexpression by transcriptional upregulation driven by the promoter of the BRAF fusion partner (McMahon, 2010; 20613748). However, it is not known if this variant results in BRAF activation or upregulation. BRAF fusions have been observed in 5% of spitzoid neoplasms (Wiesner et al., 2014; 24445538) and in 1_3% of melanomas (Stransky et al., 2014; 25204415, Ross et al., 2016; 26314551). A systematic review of 100 BRAF fusion_positive melanocytic tumor cases in the literature described BRAF fusions to be enriched for female patients, for young patients (median age of 33 years), and in tumors with spitzoid histopathologic features (Botton et al., 2019; 31618628); 42 different gene fusion partners were identified, with 55% of the partner genes having known dimerization domains, and AGK and AKAP9 being the most common recurrent partner genes (Botton et al., 2019; 31618628). BRAF rearrangement, leading to loss of the autoinhibitory region, has also been observed in 2 cases of large congenital melanocytic nevi (Dessars et al., 2007; 17301836). BRAF mutations have been reported in 37_66% of melanoma cases (Davies et al., 2002; 12068308, Hodis et al., 2012; 22817889, Krauthammer et al., 2012; 22842228, Greaves et al., 2013; 23273605), most frequently in cutaneous melanoma (41_51%)(Greaves et al., 2013; 23273605, Lee et al., 2011; 21166657), melanoma of unknown primary (52%)(Egberts et al., 2014; 24276025) and conjunctival melanoma (14_29%)(Griewank et al., 2013; 23633454, Spendlove et al., 2004; 15577314). Putative high level BRAF amplification has been reported in 5% of melanomas (cBioPortal, Mar 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). There are conflicting reports regarding the prognostic significance of BRAF mutation in the context of melanoma (Long et al., 2011; 21343559, El_Osta et al., 2011; 22039425, Ekedahl et al., 2013; 23855428, Egbert et al., 2014; 24276025). In one study of non_acral cutaneous melanoma, BRAF non_V600E mutation associated with some, but not other, clinicopathological features but did not impact OS since Stage 4 diagnosis, including OS after initiation of frontline ipilimumab treatment (Kim et al., 2016; 27911979). In a retrospective genomic screen, 3 patients with BRAF fusions in melanomas responded to consecutive CTLA_4 inhibitor ipilimumab and immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab treatments, with 2 patients reported to be disease free following ipilimumab and pembrolizumab and 1 patient progressing on ipilimumab and then responding on pembrolizumab (Turner et al., 2019; 30254212). The MEK inhibitor trametinib has also been reported to benefit patients with BRAF fusions in melanomas in case reports and basket trials (Ross et al., 2016; 26314551, Menzies et al., 2015; 26072686, Nebhan et al., 2021; 33861486). Individual case reports have also observed benefit for patients with the pan_RAF inhibitor sorafenib (Passeron et al., 2011; 22092579, Botton et al., 2013; 23890088, Boussemart et al., 2019; 30683711). Second_generation BRAF inhibitors are in development; 1 patient with melanoma and a BRAF fusion treated with PLX8394 achieved a CR, which was the best overall response in a basket trial otherwise consisting of BRAF exon 15 missense mutations (Janku et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT212). Targeting extracellular signal_regulated kinase (ERK) downstream of BRAF with ulixertinib resulted in 1 SD for the 1 patient with a BRAF fusion in another basket trial (Sullivan et al., 2018; 29247021). Single_agent BRAF V600_targeting treatments such as vemurafenib are not predicted to confer benefit in melanomas with BRAF fusions in the absence of BRAF V600 mutation; a report showed no tumor response for a patient with a BRAF fusion (Kim et al., 2017; 28092667), although a combination of dabrafenib and trametinib resulted in a PR for 1 patient with a co_occurring BRAF V600 mutation (Kulkarni et al., 2017; 28539463). Outcomes for patients with BRAF amplifications have been studied almost exclusively in the context of concurrent activating alterations and resistance mechanisms (Rizos et al., 2014; 24463458, Stagni et al., 2018; 29626128, Wilson et al., 2015; 26307133); the evidence that BRAF amplification without a concurrent activating mutation is responsive to BRAF_pathway_targeting MEK or RAF inhibitors is very limited. A patient with triple_negative breast cancer with a high_level BRAF amplification and loss of PTEN and INPP4B achieved a major response to a combination of a MEK inhibitor and an AKT inhibitor (O Shaughnessy et al., 2011; SABC Abstract S3_5). Investigational ERK (Sullivan et al., 2018; 29247021) and second_generation BRAF inhibitors (Janku et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT212) are also in development; however, it is uncertain whether these strategies would be of benefit for patients with BRAF amplifications.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "BRAF activating alterations may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of BRAF, MEK, or ERK.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Trametinib", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Trametinib is a MEK inhibitor that is FDA approved as a monotherapy to treat patients with melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations.

As a monotherapy for patients with BRAF V600E/K_mutated metastatic melanoma, trametinib improved PFS (4.9 vs. 1.5 months, HR=0.54) and median OS (15.6 vs. 11.3 months, HR=0.84) compared with patients treated with chemotherapy (Robert et al., 2019; 30690294). In a Phase 1 study, 10% (4/40) of patients with BRAF_wildtype metastatic melanoma achieved a PR (Falchook et al., 2012; 22805292). Whereas frequent adverse events precluded a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for the combination of trametinib and everolimus in a Phase 1b trial for solid tumors (Tolcher et al., 2014; 25344362), a retrospective study for heavily pretreated patients with solid tumors reported tolerable regimens of the combination for 23/31 patients, with 16 patients treated >3 months and evaluable patients achieving a median PFS of 6.5 months (Patterson et al., 2018; AACR Abstract 3891). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Selumetinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Selumetinib is a MEK inhibitor that is FDA approved to treat pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) who have symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PNs).

In a Phase 2 trial of first_line treatment of BRAF_mutated metastatic melanoma, the addition of selumetinib to dacarbazine increased PFS compared to dacarbazine plus placebo (5.6 vs 3.0 months, HR=0.63) but did not significantly improve OS (13.9 vs 10.5 months, HR 0.93, p=0.39) (Robert et al., 2013; 23735514). In a Phase 2 trial for patients with BRAF wildtype advanced melanoma, the addition of selumetinib to docetaxel did not improve median PFS compared to docetaxel plus placebo (4.2 vs 3.9 months) and was associated with lower OS (9.5 months vs 11.4 months); NRAS mutation was associated with inferior OS (HR=0.78) (Gupta et al., 2014; 24567366). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04803318", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03284502", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04375527", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04965818", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03843775", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03175432", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03905148", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04913285", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02872259", "Include": "true"}]}}, {"Name": "BRAF_DPP6 rearrangement, rearrangement intron 8", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": [{"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "BRAF_DPP6 rearrangement"}, {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "rearrangement intron 8"}]}, "Interpretation": "BRAF encodes a member of the RAF family of protein kinases, which includes ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF.

Some patients with BRAF fusions have been reported to benefit from MEK inhibitors (Fangusaro et al., 2019; 31151904, Ross et al., 2015; 26314551, Menzies et al., 2015; 26072686, Grisham et al., 2015; 26324360, Chmielecki et al., 2014; 25266736, Banerjee et al., 2017; 28339824) as well as pan_RAF inhibitor sorafenib (Subbiah et al., 2014; 24422672, Botton et al., 2013; 23890088, Passeron et al., 2011; 22092579, Karajannis et al., 2014; 24803676).

In one study of non_acral cutaneous melanoma, BRAF non_V600E mutation associated with some, but not other, clinicopathological features but did not impact OS since Stage 4 diagnosis, including OS after initiation of frontline ipilimumab treatment (Kim et al., 2016; 27911979). In a retrospective genomic screen, 3 patients with BRAF fusions in melanomas responded to consecutive CTLA_4 inhibitor ipilimumab and immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab treatments, with 2 patients reported to be disease free following ipilimumab and pembrolizumab and 1 patient progressing on ipilimumab and then responding on pembrolizumab (Turner et al., 2019; 30254212). The MEK inhibitor trametinib has also been reported to benefit patients with BRAF fusions in melanomas in case reports and basket trials (Ross et al., 2016; 26314551, Menzies et al., 2015; 26072686, Nebhan et al., 2021; 33861486). Individual case reports have also observed benefit for patients with the pan_RAF inhibitor sorafenib (Passeron et al., 2011; 22092579, Botton et al., 2013; 23890088, Boussemart et al., 2019; 30683711). Second_generation BRAF inhibitors are in development; 1 patient with melanoma and a BRAF fusion treated with PLX8394 achieved a CR, which was the best overall response in a basket trial otherwise consisting of BRAF exon 15 missense mutations (Janku et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT212). Targeting extracellular signal_regulated kinase (ERK) downstream of BRAF with ulixertinib resulted in 1 SD for the 1 patient with a BRAF fusion in another basket trial (Sullivan et al., 2018; 29247021). Single_agent BRAF V600_targeting treatments such as vemurafenib are not predicted to confer benefit in melanomas with BRAF fusions in the absence of BRAF V600 mutation; a report showed no tumor response for a patient with a BRAF fusion (Kim et al., 2017; 28092667), although a combination of dabrafenib and trametinib resulted in a PR for 1 patient with a co_occurring BRAF V600 mutation (Kulkarni et al., 2017; 28539463). Outcomes for patients with BRAF amplifications have been studied almost exclusively in the context of concurrent activating alterations and resistance mechanisms (Rizos et al., 2014; 24463458, Stagni et al., 2018; 29626128, Wilson et al., 2015; 26307133); the evidence that BRAF amplification without a concurrent activating mutation is responsive to BRAF_pathway_targeting MEK or RAF inhibitors is very limited. A patient with triple_negative breast cancer with a high_level BRAF amplification and loss of PTEN and INPP4B achieved a major response to a combination of a MEK inhibitor and an AKT inhibitor (O Shaughnessy et al., 2011; SABC Abstract S3_5). Investigational ERK (Sullivan et al., 2018; 29247021) and second_generation BRAF inhibitors (Janku et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT212) are also in development; however, it is uncertain whether these strategies would be of benefit for patients with BRAF amplifications.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "BRAF activating alterations may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of BRAF, MEK, or ERK.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Trametinib", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Trametinib is a MEK inhibitor that is FDA approved as a monotherapy to treat patients with melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations.

As a monotherapy for patients with BRAF V600E/K_mutated metastatic melanoma, trametinib improved PFS (4.9 vs. 1.5 months, HR=0.54) and median OS (15.6 vs. 11.3 months, HR=0.84) compared with patients treated with chemotherapy (Robert et al., 2019; 30690294).

These kinases function downstream of RAS as part of the MAPK (RAF_MEK_ERK) signaling cascade that facilitates cell proliferation, survival and transformation (Holderfield et al., 2014; 24957944, Burotto et al., 2014; 24948110). BRAF mutations have been reported in up to 20% of all cancers, with the majority of mutations occurring at the V600 position (Davies et al., 2002; 12068308, Kandoth et al., 2013; 24132290). BRAF amplification has been reported and correlated with overexpression of the BRAF protein in various tumor types (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, Tanami et al., 2004; 15467732, Modrek et al., 2009; 19671679, Ciampi et al., 2005; 16199894). Expression of the BRAF kinase domain without the N_terminal auto_inhibitory domain, whether with or without a fusion partner, is a BRAF class 2 subtype and has been shown to be constitutively active and to drive hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway, exhibiting transforming activity (Seivert et al., 2013; 23533272, Pouliakos et al., 2011; 22113612, Botton et al., 2013; 23890088, Ciampi et al., 2005; 15630448, Cin et al., 2011; 21424530, Dahiya et al., 2012; 22548077, Lin et al., 2012; 22157620, Tian et al., 2011; 21884820, Forshew et al., 2009; 19373855, Jones et al., 2008; 18974108, Tran et al., 2005; 15710605, Baitei et al., 2009; 19156774, Gronych et al., 2011; 21403401) in a manner sensitive to MEK inhibitors (Chmielecki et al., 2014; 25266736, Hutchinson et al., 2013; 24345920, Rizos et al., 2014; 24463458, Hartsough et al., 2014; 24520098, Carlino et al., 2014; 24476679, Baitei et al., 2009; 19156774), ERK inhibitors (Carlino et al., 2014; 24476679), the pan_RAF inhibitor sorafenib (Botton et al., 2013; 23890088, Gronych et al., 2011; 21403401), and second_generation BRAF inhibitors PLX8394 and PLX7904 (Choi et al., 2014; 24283590, Basile et al., 2014; 24422853). Some patients with BRAF fusions have been reported to benefit from MEK inhibitors (Fangusaro et al., 2019; 31151904, Ross et al., 2015; 26314551, Menzies et al., 2015; 26072686, Grisham et al., 2015; 26324360, Chmielecki et al., 2014; 25266736, Banerjee et al., 2017; 28339824) as well as pan_RAF inhibitor sorafenib (Subbiah et al., 2014; 24422672, Botton et al., 2013; 23890088, Passeron et al., 2011; 22092579, Karajannis et al., 2014; 24803676). Rearrangements, such as observed here, are predicted to be activating and oncogenic. Rearrangements such as observed here, those that are detected as a reciprocal fusion, are not clearly in frame, or may lack a fusion partner, may be indicative of an activating rearrangement event such as a fusion or an expression of the BRAF kinase domain without the N_terminal auto_inhibitory domain; however, it is unclear whether such rearrangements would lead to an oncogenic BRAF variant. Rearrangements, such as observed here, detected as a deletion of the kinase domain or a duplication of a non_kinase portion of the protein may lead to the production of an oncogenic product such as a fusion or expression of the kinase domain lacking the N_terminal autoinhibitory region; however, it is unclear whether such events would lead to a production of an oncogenic variant. Rearrangements, such as observed here, may produce a chimeric protein and/or overexpress a variant that includes both a portion of the BRAF N_terminal autoinhibitory domain (Tran et al., 2005; 15710605) and the BRAF kinase domain. Unlike other activating BRAF variants, which lack the autoinhibitory domain, it is not known whether the rearranged protein potentially produced here constitutively activates BRAF kinase. Some BRAF rearrangements are also thought to result in BRAF overexpression by transcriptional upregulation driven by the promoter of the BRAF fusion partner (McMahon, 2010; 20613748). However, it is not known if this variant results in BRAF activation or upregulation. BRAF fusions have been observed in 5% of spitzoid neoplasms (Wiesner et al., 2014; 24445538) and in 1_3% of melanomas (Stransky et al., 2014; 25204415, Ross et al., 2016; 26314551). A systematic review of 100 BRAF fusion_positive melanocytic tumor cases in the literature described BRAF fusions to be enriched for female patients, for young patients (median age of 33 years), and in tumors with spitzoid histopathologic features (Botton et al., 2019; 31618628); 42 different gene fusion partners were identified, with 55% of the partner genes having known dimerization domains, and AGK and AKAP9 being the most common recurrent partner genes (Botton et al., 2019; 31618628). BRAF rearrangement, leading to loss of the autoinhibitory region, has also been observed in 2 cases of large congenital melanocytic nevi (Dessars et al., 2007; 17301836). BRAF mutations have been reported in 37_66% of melanoma cases (Davies et al., 2002; 12068308, Hodis et al., 2012; 22817889, Krauthammer et al., 2012; 22842228, Greaves et al., 2013; 23273605), most frequently in cutaneous melanoma (41_51%)(Greaves et al., 2013; 23273605, Lee et al., 2011; 21166657), melanoma of unknown primary (52%)(Egberts et al., 2014; 24276025) and conjunctival melanoma (14_29%)(Griewank et al., 2013; 23633454, Spendlove et al., 2004; 15577314). Putative high level BRAF amplification has been reported in 5% of melanomas (cBioPortal, Mar 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). There are conflicting reports regarding the prognostic significance of BRAF mutation in the context of melanoma (Long et al., 2011; 21343559, El_Osta et al., 2011; 22039425, Ekedahl et al., 2013; 23855428, Egbert et al., 2014; 24276025).

Expression of the BRAF kinase domain without the N_terminal auto_inhibitory domain, whether with or without a fusion partner, is a BRAF class 2 subtype and has been shown to be constitutively active and to drive hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway, exhibiting transforming activity (Seivert et al., 2013; 23533272, Pouliakos et al., 2011; 22113612, Botton et al., 2013; 23890088, Ciampi et al., 2005; 15630448, Cin et al., 2011; 21424530, Dahiya et al., 2012; 22548077, Lin et al., 2012; 22157620, Tian et al., 2011; 21884820, Forshew et al., 2009; 19373855, Jones et al., 2008; 18974108, Tran et al., 2005; 15710605, Baitei et al., 2009; 19156774, Gronych et al., 2011; 21403401) in a manner sensitive to MEK inhibitors (Chmielecki et al., 2014; 25266736, Hutchinson et al., 2013; 24345920, Rizos et al., 2014; 24463458, Hartsough et al., 2014; 24520098, Carlino et al., 2014; 24476679, Baitei et al., 2009; 19156774), ERK inhibitors (Carlino et al., 2014; 24476679), the pan_RAF inhibitor sorafenib (Botton et al., 2013; 23890088, Gronych et al., 2011; 21403401), and second_generation BRAF inhibitors PLX8394 and PLX7904 (Choi et al., 2014; 24283590, Basile et al., 2014; 24422853). Some patients with BRAF fusions have been reported to benefit from MEK inhibitors (Fangusaro et al., 2019; 31151904, Ross et al., 2015; 26314551, Menzies et al., 2015; 26072686, Grisham et al., 2015; 26324360, Chmielecki et al., 2014; 25266736, Banerjee et al., 2017; 28339824) as well as pan_RAF inhibitor sorafenib (Subbiah et al., 2014; 24422672, Botton et al., 2013; 23890088, Passeron et al., 2011; 22092579, Karajannis et al., 2014; 24803676). Rearrangements, such as observed here, are predicted to be activating and oncogenic. Rearrangements such as observed here, those that are detected as a reciprocal fusion, are not clearly in frame, or may lack a fusion partner, may be indicative of an activating rearrangement event such as a fusion or an expression of the BRAF kinase domain without the N_terminal auto_inhibitory domain; however, it is unclear whether such rearrangements would lead to an oncogenic BRAF variant. Rearrangements, such as observed here, detected as a deletion of the kinase domain or a duplication of a non_kinase portion of the protein may lead to the production of an oncogenic product such as a fusion or expression of the kinase domain lacking the N_terminal autoinhibitory region; however, it is unclear whether such events would lead to a production of an oncogenic variant. Rearrangements, such as observed here, may produce a chimeric protein and/or overexpress a variant that includes both a portion of the BRAF N_terminal autoinhibitory domain (Tran et al., 2005; 15710605) and the BRAF kinase domain. Unlike other activating BRAF variants, which lack the autoinhibitory domain, it is not known whether the rearranged protein potentially produced here constitutively activates BRAF kinase. Some BRAF rearrangements are also thought to result in BRAF overexpression by transcriptional upregulation driven by the promoter of the BRAF fusion partner (McMahon, 2010; 20613748). However, it is not known if this variant results in BRAF activation or upregulation. BRAF fusions have been observed in 5% of spitzoid neoplasms (Wiesner et al., 2014; 24445538) and in 1_3% of melanomas (Stransky et al., 2014; 25204415, Ross et al., 2016; 26314551). A systematic review of 100 BRAF fusion_positive melanocytic tumor cases in the literature described BRAF fusions to be enriched for female patients, for young patients (median age of 33 years), and in tumors with spitzoid histopathologic features (Botton et al., 2019; 31618628); 42 different gene fusion partners were identified, with 55% of the partner genes having known dimerization domains, and AGK and AKAP9 being the most common recurrent partner genes (Botton et al., 2019; 31618628). BRAF rearrangement, leading to loss of the autoinhibitory region, has also been observed in 2 cases of large congenital melanocytic nevi (Dessars et al., 2007; 17301836). BRAF mutations have been reported in 37_66% of melanoma cases (Davies et al., 2002; 12068308, Hodis et al., 2012; 22817889, Krauthammer et al., 2012; 22842228, Greaves et al., 2013; 23273605), most frequently in cutaneous melanoma (41_51%)(Greaves et al., 2013; 23273605, Lee et al., 2011; 21166657), melanoma of unknown primary (52%)(Egberts et al., 2014; 24276025) and conjunctival melanoma (14_29%)(Griewank et al., 2013; 23633454, Spendlove et al., 2004; 15577314). Putative high level BRAF amplification has been reported in 5% of melanomas (cBioPortal, Mar 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). There are conflicting reports regarding the prognostic significance of BRAF mutation in the context of melanoma (Long et al., 2011; 21343559, El_Osta et al., 2011; 22039425, Ekedahl et al., 2013; 23855428, Egbert et al., 2014; 24276025). In one study of non_acral cutaneous melanoma, BRAF non_V600E mutation associated with some, but not other, clinicopathological features but did not impact OS since Stage 4 diagnosis, including OS after initiation of frontline ipilimumab treatment (Kim et al., 2016; 27911979). In a retrospective genomic screen, 3 patients with BRAF fusions in melanomas responded to consecutive CTLA_4 inhibitor ipilimumab and immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab treatments, with 2 patients reported to be disease free following ipilimumab and pembrolizumab and 1 patient progressing on ipilimumab and then responding on pembrolizumab (Turner et al., 2019; 30254212). The MEK inhibitor trametinib has also been reported to benefit patients with BRAF fusions in melanomas in case reports and basket trials (Ross et al., 2016; 26314551, Menzies et al., 2015; 26072686, Nebhan et al., 2021; 33861486). Individual case reports have also observed benefit for patients with the pan_RAF inhibitor sorafenib (Passeron et al., 2011; 22092579, Botton et al., 2013; 23890088, Boussemart et al., 2019; 30683711). Second_generation BRAF inhibitors are in development; 1 patient with melanoma and a BRAF fusion treated with PLX8394 achieved a CR, which was the best overall response in a basket trial otherwise consisting of BRAF exon 15 missense mutations (Janku et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT212). Targeting extracellular signal_regulated kinase (ERK) downstream of BRAF with ulixertinib resulted in 1 SD for the 1 patient with a BRAF fusion in another basket trial (Sullivan et al., 2018; 29247021). Single_agent BRAF V600_targeting treatments such as vemurafenib are not predicted to confer benefit in melanomas with BRAF fusions in the absence of BRAF V600 mutation; a report showed no tumor response for a patient with a BRAF fusion (Kim et al., 2017; 28092667), although a combination of dabrafenib and trametinib resulted in a PR for 1 patient with a co_occurring BRAF V600 mutation (Kulkarni et al., 2017; 28539463). Outcomes for patients with BRAF amplifications have been studied almost exclusively in the context of concurrent activating alterations and resistance mechanisms (Rizos et al., 2014; 24463458, Stagni et al., 2018; 29626128, Wilson et al., 2015; 26307133); the evidence that BRAF amplification without a concurrent activating mutation is responsive to BRAF_pathway_targeting MEK or RAF inhibitors is very limited. A patient with triple_negative breast cancer with a high_level BRAF amplification and loss of PTEN and INPP4B achieved a major response to a combination of a MEK inhibitor and an AKT inhibitor (O Shaughnessy et al., 2011; SABC Abstract S3_5). Investigational ERK (Sullivan et al., 2018; 29247021) and second_generation BRAF inhibitors (Janku et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT212) are also in development; however, it is uncertain whether these strategies would be of benefit for patients with BRAF amplifications.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "BRAF activating alterations may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of BRAF, MEK, or ERK.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Trametinib", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Trametinib is a MEK inhibitor that is FDA approved as a monotherapy to treat patients with melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations.

As a monotherapy for patients with BRAF V600E/K_mutated metastatic melanoma, trametinib improved PFS (4.9 vs. 1.5 months, HR=0.54) and median OS (15.6 vs. 11.3 months, HR=0.84) compared with patients treated with chemotherapy (Robert et al., 2019; 30690294). In a Phase 1 study, 10% (4/40) of patients with BRAF_wildtype metastatic melanoma achieved a PR (Falchook et al., 2012; 22805292). Whereas frequent adverse events precluded a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for the combination of trametinib and everolimus in a Phase 1b trial for solid tumors (Tolcher et al., 2014; 25344362), a retrospective study for heavily pretreated patients with solid tumors reported tolerable regimens of the combination for 23/31 patients, with 16 patients treated >3 months and evaluable patients achieving a median PFS of 6.5 months (Patterson et al., 2018; AACR Abstract 3891). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Selumetinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Selumetinib is a MEK inhibitor that is FDA approved to treat pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) who have symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PNs).

In a Phase 2 trial for patients with BRAF wildtype advanced melanoma, the addition of selumetinib to docetaxel did not improve median PFS compared to docetaxel plus placebo (4.2 vs 3.9 months) and was associated with lower OS (9.5 months vs 11.4 months); NRAS mutation was associated with inferior OS (HR=0.78) (Gupta et al., 2014; 24567366). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04803318", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03284502", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04375527", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04965818", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03843775", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03175432", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03905148", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04913285", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02872259", "Include": "true"}]}}, {"Name": "BRAF_SDHA non_canonical fusion", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "BRAF_SDHA non_canonical fusion"}}, "Interpretation": "BRAF encodes a member of the RAF family of protein kinases, which includes ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF.

Decreased expression of MTAP leads to MTA accumulation within tumor cells and their microenvironment (Kirovski et al., 2011; 21356366, Limm et al., 2013; 23265702, Stevens et al., 2009; 19097084), thereby reducing intracellular arginine methylation (Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473, Mavrakis et al., 2016; 26912361, Kryukov et al., 2016; 26912360) and altering cell signaling (Limm et al., 2014; 25087184, Stevens et al., 2009; 19097084). MTAP is located at 9p21, adjacent to CDKN2A and CDKN2B, with which it is frequently co_deleted in various cancers. Other alterations in MTAP are rare and have not been extensively characterized. MTAP loss/homozygous deletion as well as loss of expression has been reported in a wide variety of solid tumors and hematologic cancers (Wei et al., 2016; 27929028, Zhao and Zhao, 2016; 27556634); such events have been correlated with poor prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (Kirovski et al., 2011; 21356366), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (Huang et al., 2009; 19887491), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)(Marce et al., 2006; 16778103), melanoma (Meyer et al., 2010; 20500769, Wild et al., 2006; 16618867), gastric cancer (Kim et al., 2011; 21412930), myxofibrosarcoma (Li et al., 2014; 25426549), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (He et al., 2015; 26656376), ovarian carcinoma (Wei et al., 2016; 27929028) and non_small cell lung cancer (Su et al., 2014; 24969958). MTAP loss was not prognostic in pediatric B_cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (Mirebeau et al., 2006; 16818274) or in astrocytoma (Becker et al., 2015; 26088413). However, MTAP has also been reported to be overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (Snezhkina et al., 2016; 27433286), and MTAP retention is thought to be important for prostate cancer growth due to continuous supply of SAM (Bistulfi et al., 2016; 26910893). Germline SNPs in MTAP have been correlated with the development of cutaneous melanoma (Antonopoulou et al., 2015; 25407435, Mccioni et al., 2013; 23816148), esophageal cancer (Hyland et al., 2016; 26635288, Lin et al., 2017; 27960044), osteosarcoma (Zhi et al., 2016; 27994653), and CRC (Gu et al., 2013; 23361049). MTAP inactivation produces specific metabolic vulnerabilities that may be sensitive to MAT2A (Kalev et al., 2021; 33450196, Heist et al., 2019; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract B116, Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473) or PRMT5 inhibition (Marjon et al., 2016; 27068473, Mavrakis et al., 2016; 26912361, Kryukov et al., 2016; 26912360). A Phase 1 trial of MAT2A inhibitor AG_270 reported 1 PR and 2 SDs lasting longer than 6 months for patients with advanced solid tumors displaying MTAP loss (Heist et al., 2019; AACR_NCI_EORTC Abstract B116). Preclinical data suggest that MTAP loss sensitizes cells to S_adenosyl_l_methionine (SAM)_competitive PRMT5 inhibitors (Guccione and Richard, 2019; 31350521), dual PRMT1 and PRMT5 inhibitors (Fedoriw et al., 2019; 31257072, Srour et al., 2019; 31287990, Gao et al., 2019; 30916320), and PRMT5 inhibitors that selectively bind the PRMT5 when complexed with S_methyl_5 _thioadenosine (MTA), such as MRTX1719 (Smith et al., 2022; 35041419). In preclinical models, MTAP inactivation showed increased sensitivity to inhibitors of purine synthesis or purine analogs, especially upon addition of exogenous MTA (Hansen et al., 2019; 31040154, Tang et al., 2018; 29844120, Munshi et al., 2014; 24928612, de Oliveira et al., 2016; 26751376, Lubin and Lubin, 2009; 19478948, Tang et al., 2012; 22825330, Collins et al., 2012; 22252602, Bertino et al., 2011; 21301207, Coulthard et al., 2011; 21282358, Miyazaki et al., 2007; 17912432, Efferth et al., 2002; 11987241). A Phase 2 study of L_alanosine, an inhibitor of adenine synthesis, as a monotherapy for 65 patients with MTAP_deficient cancers reported no responses and SD for 24% (13/55) of patients (Kindler et al., 2009; 18618081).

PIK3CA mutations have been reported to be associated with metastasis and patient mortality in melanoma (Park et al., 2013; 23462921). Mutations in PIK3CA have been reported in NRAS wild type melanoma, and may represent an alternate mechanism of AKT_mTOR activation (Omholt et al., 2006; 16567976). Clinical and preclinical data in various tumor types indicate that PIK3CA activating alterations may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting PI3K (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574, Juric et al., 2018; 29401002, Gallant et al., 2019; 30793038, Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23, Delestre et al., 2021; 34613809, Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Santin et al., 2020; 31934607, Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871), AKT (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Smyth et al., 2021; 33863913), or mTOR (Park et al., 2016; 27105424, Lim et al., 2016; 26859683, Hou et al., 2014; 25426553, Varnier et al., 2019; 31351267, Janku et al., 2014; 24440717, Moroney et al., 2012; 22927482, Basho et al., 2017; 27893038, Moroney et al., 2011; 21890452). The Phase 2 NCI_MATCH study of copanlisib for patients with refractory solid tumors harboring PIK3CA mutations with or without PTEN loss met its primary endpoint with an ORR of 16% (4/25 PRs); responses (PR or SD >6 months) were seen in patients with ameloblastoma, liposarcoma, and carcinomas of the endometrium, ovary, esophagus, lung, and prostate (Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871). However, the Phase 2 study of copanlisib for patients with endometrial carcinoma harboring PIK3CA hotspot mutations failed to report any objective responses (n=11)(Santin et al., 2020; 31934607). Two other studies of copanlisib for patients with genomically unselected tumors reported 1 CR and 2 PRs (1 unconfirmed) among 16 total patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors with or without PTEN alterations (Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108). In the Phase 2 MATCH trial for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors, 28% (18/65) of patients experienced PFS lasting at least 6 months after treatment with taselisib; however, no ORs were observed in this study (Krop et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 101). A separate Phase 1b study of taselisib in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors reported an ORR of 0% (n=12) and a DCR of 17% (2/12) (Pascual et al., 2021; 32958578).

PTEN mutations have been reported in up to 9.9% of skin melanomas (cBio_Liu et al., 2019; 31792460, cBio_Hodis et al., 2012; 22817889). Decreased PTEN expression or function, through PTEN methylation, mutation, or deletion, has been reported in 30_60% of melanoma cases in the literature (Zhou et al., 2000; 11021816, Monzon and Dancey, 2012; 22419879, Masaki et al., 2014; 24483290, Abdel_Rahman et al., 2006; 16344319). Loss of PTEN protein expression is significantly associated with reduced overall survival and brain metastasis in patients with BRAF V600_mutant melanoma but not in those with NRAS_mutant melanoma (Bucheit et al., 2014; 25165098). In patients with melanoma, multivariate analysis identified PTEN promoter methylation as an independent negative prognostic factor for survival (Roh et al., 2016; 26854490). PTEN loss or mutation leads to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway (Courtney et al., 2010; 20085938, Simpson and Parsons, 2001; 11237521, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Milella et al., 2017; 28220839). Across various tissues, most clinical studies have not observed an association between PTEN deficiency and response to inhibitors of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway. However, limited studies in prostate cancer (Templeton et al., 2013; 23582881, Sweeney et al., 2021; 34246347, de Bono et al., 2019; 30037818, Saura et al., 2017; 27872130), renal cell carcinoma (Voss et al., 2019; 30327302), breast cancer (Andre et al., 2016; 27091708, Dent et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 1008, Schmid et al., 2020; 31841354), and colorectal cancer (Gilcrease et al., 2019; 30302599) have reported an association between PTEN deficiency and response to inhibitors targeting the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway. Preclinical data indicate that PTEN loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Mendes_Pereira et al., 2009; 20049735, Shen et al., 2013; 23881923, Chatterjee et al., 2013; 23565244, McCormick et al., 2016; 26905328, Forster et al., 2011; 21468130), and clinical benefit has been observed for patients with PTEN_altered breast cancer including triple negative breast cancer (Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006, Eikesdal et al., 2021; 33242536), ovarian cancer (Dougherty et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 5536), uterine leiomyosarcoma (Pan et al., 2021; 33970096), and endometrial cancer (Forster et al., 2011; 21468130) treated with PARP inhibitors. However, some studies have reported a lack of association between PTEN mutation and PARP inhibitor sensitivity (Sandhu et al., 2013; 23810788, Romero et al., 2020; 32988624, Piha_Paul et al., 2018; AACR Abstract A096). PTEN mutations underlie several inherited disorders, collectively termed PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS), which include Cowden syndrome (CS) and its variant Lhermitte_Duclos disease (LD), Bannayan_Riley_Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), PTEN_related Proteus syndrome (PS), and Proteus_like syndrome (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191, Orloff and Eng, 2008; 18794875). The mutation rate for PTEN in these disorders ranges from 20 to 85% of patients (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191, Zbuk and Eng, 2007; 17167516). The estimated incidence of Cowden syndrome is 1/200,000, which may be an underestimate due to the high variability of this disorder (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191). Given the association between PTEN and these inherited syndromes, in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing for mutations affecting PTEN is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PTEN loss or inactivating mutations may lead to increased activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.

BCOR activity is required for normal development; de novo germline mutations in BCOR have been linked to syndromic microphthalmia_2 and oculofaciocardiodental syndrome (Ng et al., 2004; 15004558). BCOR inactivation has been reported in various malignancies, whereas BCOR fusions and internal tandem duplications (ITDs) are characteristic of specific tumor types (Pierron et al., 2012; 22387997, Kao et al., 2016; 27428733, Specht et al., 2016; 26752546, Panagopoulos et al., 2013; 23580382, Antonescu et al., 2014; 24285434, Astolfi et al., 2015; 26516930, Roy et al., 2015; 26573325, Kao et al., 2016; 26945340, Kao et al., 2016; 27428733, Cramer et al., 2017; 28687574, Appay et al., 2017; 28704208). BCOR alteration (mutation or homozygous deletion) has been reported in 5.4% of rhabdomyosarcoma cases, with BCOR alterations occurring more frequently in PAX fusion_negative tumors (7%) than PAX fusion_positive (1.9%) tumors (Shern et al., 2014; 24436047); BCOR mutation has also been reported in 3.2% (3/92) of medulloblastoma cases (Pugh et al., 2012; 22820256). In the context of hematologic disease, BCOR mutation has also been reported in 4% of aplastic anemia cases (Kulasekararaj et al., 2014; 25139356), 4.2% of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cases (Damm et al., 2013; 24047651), 7.2% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia cases (Damm et al., 2013; 24047651), and 3.8% of normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases (Grossman et al., 2011; 22012066).

Both p15INK4b and p16INK4a bind to and inhibit CDK4 and CDK6, thereby maintaining the growth_suppressive activity of the Rb tumor suppressor; loss or inactivation of either p15INK4b or p16INK4a contributes to dysregulation of the CDK4/6_cyclin_Rb pathway and loss of cell cycle control (Gazzeri et al., 1998; 9484839, Roussel, 1999; 10498883). The tumor suppressive functions of p14ARF involve stabilization and activation of p53, via a mechanism of MDM2 inhibition (Sherr et al., 2005; 16869746, Ozenne et al., 2010; 20549699). One or more alterations observed here are predicted to result in p16INK4a loss of function (Ruas et al., 1999; 10498896, Jones et al., 2007; 17909018, Haferkamp et al., 2008; 18843795, Huot et al., 2002; 12417717, Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Gombart et al., 1997; 9324288, Yang et al., 1995; 7780957, Parry and Peters, 1996; 8668202, Greenblatt et al., 2003; 12606942, Yarbrough et al., 1999; 10491434, Poi et al., 2001; 11255261, Byeon et al., 1998; 9660926, Kannengiesser et al., 2009; 19260062, Lal et al., 2000; 10719365, Koh et al., 1995; 7777061, McKenzie et al., 2010; 20340136, Miller et al., 2011; 21462282, Arap et al., 1997; 905385, Scaini et al., 2014; 24659262, Jenkins et al., 2013; 23190892, Walker et al., 1999; 10389768, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). One or more alterations seen here are predicted to result in p14ARF loss of function (Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Itahana and Zhang, 2008; 18538737, Zhang and Xiong, 1999; 10360174, Zhang et al., 1998; 9529249, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). CDKN2B alterations such as seen here are predicted to inactivate p15INK4b (Jafri et al., 2015; 25873077). Concomitant loss of p16INK4a and p14ARF in melanoma is common, although loss of activity of either may also occur as a result of transcript_specific mutations or hypermethylation (Gallagher et al., 2008; 18953432, Freedberg et al., 2008; 18505964, Bachmann et al., 2004; 15547691, van der Velden et al., 2001; 11431374, Fauri et al., 2011; 22942654, Jonsson et al., 2010; 20703244, Hsieh et al., 2009; 20415670). Homozygous deletion of CDKN2A and/or CDKN2B has been reported in 14_28% of melanoma cases (cBioPortal, Oct 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, J\u00f6nsson et al., 2010; 20460471, Busch et al., 2010; 20505745, Flores et al., 1996; 8895759). Various correlations between CDKN2A alterations and tumor histology or patient prognosis in melanoma have been reported in the literature, with some studies reporting CDKN2A deletion to be associated with adverse prognosis and other studies reporting no association between CDKN2A deletion and prognosis (Grafstr\u00f6m et al., 2005; 15837753, J\u00f6nsson et al., 2010; 20460471, Puig et al., 2000; 10890376, Busch et al., 2010; 20505745). Studies suggest that deletion of CDKN2A is an early event in melanoma tumorigenesis, and loss of p16INK4a has been associated with increased DNA damage in human benign melanocytic tumors and has been suggested to contribute to tumorigenesis by promoting the proliferation of cells with genetic damage (Fung et al., 2012; 23279822, Matsumura et al., 1998; 9617435). CDKN2A alterations affecting p16INK4a, p14ARF, or both have been strongly associated (up to a 76% risk) with familial melanoma (Aspinwall et al., 2013; 23382133, Bandarchi et al., 2010; 20936153, Binni et al., 2010; 20132244, Garcia_Casado et al., 2009; 19741424, Gruis et al., 1995; 7640518, Harland et al., 2001; 11726555, Liu et al., 1995; 7624155, Puntervoll et al., 2013; 23384855, Ranade et al., 1995; 7647780, Randerson_Moor et al., 2001; 11136714, Veinalde et al., 2013; 23546221). Clinical data in mesothelioma, breast cancer, and uterine leiomyosarcoma indicate that CDKN2A loss may predict sensitivity to abemaciclib (Fennell et al., 2022; 35157829) and palbociclib treatment (Elvin et al., 2017; 28283584, Gao et al., 2015; 26715889). However, multiple other clinical studies have shown no significant correlation between p16INK4a loss or inactivation and therapeutic benefit of these agents (Gopalan et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8077, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Konecny et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5557)(DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Johnson et al., 2014; 24797823); it is not known whether CDK4/6 inhibitors would be beneficial in this case. Although preclinical studies have suggested that loss of p14ARF function may be associated with reduced sensitivity to MDM2 inhibitors (Van Maerken et al., 2011; 21460101, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357), the clinical relevance of p14ARF as a predictive biomarker is not clear. Preclinical data suggest that tumors with loss of p16INK4a function may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, ribociclib, and palbociclib (Konecny et al., 2011; 21278246, Katsumi et al., 2011; 21871868, Cen et al., 2012; 22711607, Logan et al., 2013; 23898052). There are no drugs that directly target the mutation or loss of CDKN2B in cancer. Because the p15INK4b protein encoded by CDKN2B is known to inhibit CDK4, tumors with CDKN2B mutation or loss may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as ribociclib, abemaciclib, and palbociclib (Infante et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 2528, Shapiro et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 2500)(Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126). Germline CDKN2A mutation is associated with melanoma_pancreatic cancer syndrome, a condition marked by increased risk of developing malignant melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer (Whelan et al., 1995; 7666917). Mutation carriers within families may develop either or both types of cancer, and melanoma cases may be referred to as familial or hereditary melanoma (Hansson, 2010; 20687502, Hogg et al., 1998; 9479083). CDKN2A is the most implicated gene in familial melanoma, with germline mutations present in 16% to 20% of familial melanoma cases (De Unamuno et al., 2018; 29543703, Soura et al., 2016; 26892650, Huerta et al., 2018; 29405243). CDKN2A alteration has also been implicated in familial melanoma_astrocytoma syndrome, an extremely rare tumor association characterized by dual predisposition to melanoma and nervous system tumors (Kaufman et al., 1993; 8414022, Bahuau et al., 1998; 9622062, Chan et al., 2017; 28699883).

Various correlations between CDKN2A alterations and tumor histology or patient prognosis in melanoma have been reported in the literature, with some studies reporting CDKN2A deletion to be associated with adverse prognosis and other studies reporting no association between CDKN2A deletion and prognosis (Grafstr\u00f6m et al., 2005; 15837753, J\u00f6nsson et al., 2010; 20460471, Puig et al., 2000; 10890376, Busch et al., 2010; 20505745). Studies suggest that deletion of CDKN2A is an early event in melanoma tumorigenesis, and loss of p16INK4a has been associated with increased DNA damage in human benign melanocytic tumors and has been suggested to contribute to tumorigenesis by promoting the proliferation of cells with genetic damage (Fung et al., 2012; 23279822, Matsumura et al., 1998; 9617435). CDKN2A alterations affecting p16INK4a, p14ARF, or both have been strongly associated (up to a 76% risk) with familial melanoma (Aspinwall et al., 2013; 23382133, Bandarchi et al., 2010; 20936153, Binni et al., 2010; 20132244, Garcia_Casado et al., 2009; 19741424, Gruis et al., 1995; 7640518, Harland et al., 2001; 11726555, Liu et al., 1995; 7624155, Puntervoll et al., 2013; 23384855, Ranade et al., 1995; 7647780, Randerson_Moor et al., 2001; 11136714, Veinalde et al., 2013; 23546221). Clinical data in mesothelioma, breast cancer, and uterine leiomyosarcoma indicate that CDKN2A loss may predict sensitivity to abemaciclib (Fennell et al., 2022; 35157829) and palbociclib treatment (Elvin et al., 2017; 28283584, Gao et al., 2015; 26715889). However, multiple other clinical studies have shown no significant correlation between p16INK4a loss or inactivation and therapeutic benefit of these agents (Gopalan et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8077, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Konecny et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5557)(DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Johnson et al., 2014; 24797823); it is not known whether CDK4/6 inhibitors would be beneficial in this case. Although preclinical studies have suggested that loss of p14ARF function may be associated with reduced sensitivity to MDM2 inhibitors (Van Maerken et al., 2011; 21460101, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357), the clinical relevance of p14ARF as a predictive biomarker is not clear. Preclinical data suggest that tumors with loss of p16INK4a function may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, ribociclib, and palbociclib (Konecny et al., 2011; 21278246, Katsumi et al., 2011; 21871868, Cen et al., 2012; 22711607, Logan et al., 2013; 23898052). There are no drugs that directly target the mutation or loss of CDKN2B in cancer. Because the p15INK4b protein encoded by CDKN2B is known to inhibit CDK4, tumors with CDKN2B mutation or loss may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as ribociclib, abemaciclib, and palbociclib (Infante et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 2528, Shapiro et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 2500)(Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126). Germline CDKN2A mutation is associated with melanoma_pancreatic cancer syndrome, a condition marked by increased risk of developing malignant melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer (Whelan et al., 1995; 7666917). Mutation carriers within families may develop either or both types of cancer, and melanoma cases may be referred to as familial or hereditary melanoma (Hansson, 2010; 20687502, Hogg et al., 1998; 9479083). CDKN2A is the most implicated gene in familial melanoma, with germline mutations present in 16% to 20% of familial melanoma cases (De Unamuno et al., 2018; 29543703, Soura et al., 2016; 26892650, Huerta et al., 2018; 29405243). CDKN2A alteration has also been implicated in familial melanoma_astrocytoma syndrome, an extremely rare tumor association characterized by dual predisposition to melanoma and nervous system tumors (Kaufman et al., 1993; 8414022, Bahuau et al., 1998; 9622062, Chan et al., 2017; 28699883). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of CDKN2A is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "FAS", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "loss", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "loss"}}, "Interpretation": "FAS encodes the protein CD95, a cell surface receptor for the protein FAS ligand (FASL) and a key regulator of apoptosis during lymphocyte development. Heterozygous mutations in FAS underlie autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) and certain germline mutations in FAS are associated with an increased risk of lymphoma development (Rao and Oliveira, 2011; 21885601, Straus et al., 2001; 11418480, Dowdell et al., 2010; 20360470). In the TCGA datasets, FAS mutation has most frequently been observed in diffuse large B_cell lymphoma (DLBCL)(6%), uterine corpus endometrioid carcinoma (6%), cervical squamous cell carcinoma (2%), and melanoma (2%); FAS putative homozygous deletion was most frequently observed in diffuse large B_cell lymphoma (DLBCL)(6%), prostate adenocarcinoma (6%), and sarcomas (3%) (cBioPortal, Jan 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Although CD95 is of significant interest as a target for anti_cancer therapies (Villa_Morales and Fern\u00e1ndez_Piqueras, 2012; 22239437, Abramson and Shipp, 2005; 15855278, Debatin and Krammer, 2004; 15077156), there are no targeted therapies available to address mutation of FAS in cancer.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI has been detected in 16_32% of cutaneous melanomas in several small datasets, with the majority exhibiting MSI_low (Kubecek et al., 2016; 27623135). A higher frequency of MSI (low and high) has been reported in metastatic tumors (20_77%) compared to primary tumors (2_30%) (Kubecek et al., 2016; 27372860). No association between MSI status and clinicopathological features of patients with melanoma was reported in one study (Peris et al., 1995; 7561170). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "00", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "00"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Johnson et al., 2016; 27671167, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Eroglu et al, 2018; 29320474, Shin et al., 2017; 27903500, Riaz et al., 2017; 29033130, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Ribas et al., 2019; AACR abstract 4217, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919529). A large_scale genomic analysis found that various melanoma subtypes harbored median TMBs between 6.3 and 14.4 Muts/Mb, and 25% to 40% of cases had elevated TMBs of greater than 20 Muts/Mb (FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). Malignant melanoma has been reported to have a high prevalence of somatic mutations compared with other tumor types (Alexandrov et al., 2013; 23945592), with desmoplastic melanoma ranking among the highest of melanoma subtypes (median TMB of 62 Muts/Mb)(Shain et al., 2015; 26343386). Higher mutational load has been reported in NF1_mutant melanoma samples compared with BRAF_mutant, NRAS_mutant, or BRAF/NRAS/NF1 wild_type samples (Johnson et al., 2016; 27671167). In 1 study, elevated TMB correlated with PD_L1 positive status and increased OS in tissue specimens from patients with Stage 3 melanoma (Madore et al., 2016; 26960397). In another study, elevated tissue TMB (>20 Muts/Mb) was associated with longer PFS and OS in patients treated with anti_PD_1 or anti_PD_L1 immunotherapy as compared with patients with lower TMB (Johnson et al., 2016; 27671167). Increased TMB has also been associated with histologic stage and cumulative sun exposure (Shain et al., 2015; 26559571). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma, higher TMB has corresponded with clinical benefit from treatment with anti_PD_1 or anti_PD_L1 treatments (Hodi et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT037, Ribas et al., 2019; AACR Abstract 4217, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Johnson et al., 2016; 27671167, Ning et al., 2022; 35355708). Increased TMB has been associated with longer PFS and OS for patients with melanoma treated with nivolumab, with studies reporting increased benefit for patients with a mutational load above 162 missense mutations per tumor (~equivalency >8 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) (Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037). Increased TMB (~equivalency >10.8 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) has also been associated with longer PFS and OS for patients with melanoma treated with combination nivolumab and ipilumumab (Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037). Improved PFS and OS of patients with melanoma treated with ipilumumab has been observed across all TMB levels (Ribas et al., 2019; AACR abstract 4217, Liu et al., 2019; 31515453).", "Include": "true",
