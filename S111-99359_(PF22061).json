In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). EGFR L858 is located in the kinase domain and is encoded by exon 21. EGFR L858R has been characterized as activating (Lynch et al., 2004; 15118073, Paez et al., 2004; 15118125, Pao et al., 2004; 15329413) and patients with the L858R mutation have been shown to be sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as erlotinib, gefitinib (Lynch et al., 2004; 15118073, Paez et al., 2004; 15118125, Pao et al., 2004; 15329413), and afatinib (Yang et al., 2015; 25589191). The EGFR T790M mutation, when co_occurring with EGFR activating alterations, has been associated with clinical resistance to gefitinib (Sequist et al., 2011; 21430269, Pao et al., 2005; 15737014, Kosaka et al., 2006; 17020982, Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009), erlotinib (Sequist et al., 2011; 21430269, Pao et al., 2005; 15737014, Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009), dacomitinib (Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009, Janne et al., 2011; 21220471, Yu et al., 2017; 29191595, Ercan et al., 2010; 20118985), and afatinib (Wu et al., 2016; 26862733, Nakamura et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P3.13_18, Lee et al., 2019; 30885357, Lin et al., 2019; 30485437, Kaburagi et al., 2018; 29715155, Tanaka et al., 2017; 28978102), as well as preclinical resistance to lapatinib (Avizienyte et al., 2008; 18588508, Gilmer et al., 2008; 18199554). Rare cases of EGFR T790M without a concurrent activating alteration have been reported (Gazdar et al., 2014; 24736066) and germline T790M mutations have been reported to predispose to familial lung adenocarcinoma (Bell et al., 2005; 16258541, Oxnard et al., 2012; 22588155, Gazdar et al., 2014; 24736066). Limited preclinical data suggests T790M alone is weakly activating, and increased EGFR activity is observed when T790M is expressed with certain activating EGFR alterations (Godin_Heymann et al., 2007; 17671201). Therefore, although this alteration has not been fully characterized, it is likely to result in reduced sensitivity to first_ and second_generation EGFR inhibitors. EGFR mutation has been reported in 12_36% of lung adenocarcinomas (Vallee et al., 2013; 23934203, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552) and in 4% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745). EGFR protein expression/overexpression has been reported in up to 70% of NSCLC cases (Watzka et al., 2010; 20353893, Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Grob et al., 2013; 23238037, Park et al., 2012; 22207554, Dobashi et al., 2011; 21040950, Ludovini et al., 2013; 23314677). In addition, expression of EGFR protein has been shown to be higher in lung squamous cell carcinoma samples as compared to lung adenocarcinoma (Skrzypski et al., 2013; 23870818, Kim et al., 2012; 22419022). In patients with lung adenocarcinoma, EGFR mutation was a predictor of poor overall survival (Lee et al., 2013; 23525704, Oakley and Chiosea, 2011; 21587084). However, EGFR mutations have been reported to predict improved survival in patients with resected Stage 1_3 lung adenocarcinoma (Marks et al., 2008; 18303429) or resected Stage 1 NSCLC (Izar et al., 2013; 23932319). In a retrospective study of lung adenocarcinoma treated with surgical resection without neoadjuvant TKIs, significantly shorter OS and recurrence_free survival was observed for patients harboring uncommon EGFR mutations (G719X, T790M, or L861R/Q) compared with those harboring only common mutations (L858R or exon 19 deletion) (Hayasaka et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P3.16_03). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer, EGFR activating mutations may predict sensitivity to EGFR TKIs, including erlotinib (Rosell et al., 2011; 22285168), gefitinib (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064), afatinib (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960), dacomitinib (Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), and osimertinib (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549); however, the data for patients with other tumor types are limited (Hong et al., 2020; 32749686, Kim et al., 2015; 26462025, Kim et al., 2015; 25424851, Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840, Cavalieri et al., 2018; 29734047, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Audet et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 6041). The efficacy of third_generation EGFR inhibitors that selectively target EGFR T790M in non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been confirmed in osimertinib (Yang et al., 2019; 31809241, Yang et al., 2017; 28221867, Goss et al., 2016; 27751847, Janne et al., 2015; 25923549, Auliac et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P1.13_09, Kang et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract MA08.07, Soria et al., 2018; 29151359), D_0316 (Lu et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT170), abivertinib (Zhou et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9091, Wang et al., 2020; 31943845, Ma et al., 2018; 29626621), alflutinib (Shi et al., 2021; 33780662, Shi et al., 2021; DOI: 10.1016/J.JTHO.2021.01.1122), naquotinib (Azuma et al., 2018; 29807396, Kelly et al., 2019; 31070709, Murakami et al., 2018; 29972716, Yu et al., 2017; 28954786), nazartinib (Tan et al., 2020; 31954624), and olmutinib (Park et al., 2021; 33434335, Kim et al., 2019; 31447004). The Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study of amivantamab monotherapy or in combination with lazertinib for the treatment of EGFR_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has produced encouraging preliminary results for treatment_naive patients and patients who relapsed after treatment with osimertinib with and without chemotherapy, including osimertinib_relapsed patients with biomarkers indicating EGFR/MET_based osimertinib resistance (Leighl et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 1192MO, Cho et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 1258O, Bauml et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9006, Shu et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 1193MO). In a Phase 1 trial, the HER3_targeted antibody patritumab deruxtecan elicited an ORR of 39% (22/57, 1 CR) and a median PFS of 8.2 months for patients with non_small cell lung cancer previously treated with an EGFR TKI, many of whom displayed TKI resistance alterations (Janne et al., 2022; 34548309). A Phase 1 trial evaluating the EGFR inhibitor AZD3759 reported a reduction in the volume of brain metastases in 40% (8/20) of patients with previously treated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring either the EGFR L858R alteration or EGFR exon 19 deletion, including 3 confirmed PRs and 3 unconfirmed PRs (Ahn et al., 2017; 29056570, Yang et al., 2016; 27928026). In a Phase 1/2 trial for advanced NSCLC, the brain_penetrant third_generation EGFR TKI lazertinib enabled ORRs of 54% (69/127) for all evaluable patients and 44% (8/18, intracranial) for patients with brain metastases (Ahn et al., 2019; 31587882). A Phase 1 trial evaluating the irreversible pan_HER inhibitor FCN_411 for NSCLC patients who had EGFR mutations and experienced disease progression on standard treatments reported an ORR of 15% with 10/67 patients achieving PR, and a DCR of 73% with 39 additional patients achieving SD (Lin et al., 2022; 35248866). OR was observed in a numerically higher proportion of patients with the EGFR T790M mutation than those without this mutation (Lin et al., 2022; 35248866). The EGFR T790M mutation, when co_occurring with an EGFR activating alteration, confers clinical resistance to gefitinib (Sequist et al., 2011; 21430269, Pao et al., 2005; 15737014, Kosaka et al., 2006; 17020982, Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009), erlotinib (Sequist et al., 2011; 21430269, Pao et al., 2005; 15737014, Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009), afatinib (Wu et al., 2016; 26862733, Tanaka et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P3.13_22, Nakamura et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P3.13_18, Lee et al., 2019; 30885357, Lin et al., 2019; 30485437, Kaburagi et al., 2018; 29715155), and dacomitinib (Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009, Janne et al., 2011; 21220471, Yu et al., 2017; 29191595, Ercan et al., 2010; 20118985). Preclinical resistance to lapatinib has also been reported (Avizienyte et al., 2008; 18588508, Gilmer et al., 2008; 18199554). Patients with EGFR_mutated non_squamous metastatic non_small cell lung cancer previously treated with EGFR TKI have benefited from immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with anti_angiogenic and chemotherapy, particularly atezolizumab plus bevacizumab plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (OS HR 0.61 compared with bevacizumab/chemotherapy) (Reck et al., 2019; 30922878, Socinski et al., 2021; 34311108, Socinski et al., 2018; 29863955) or sintilimab plus bevacizumab biosimilar plus cisplatin and pemetrexed (PFS HR 0.46 compared with chemotherapy alone) (Lu et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract VP9_2021).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

A Phase 1 trial of combination dacomitinib and a MEK1/2 inhibitor for patients with KRAS_mutated CRC, NSCLC, or pancreatic cancer reported 20/36 SDs and 16 PDs, however toxicity from this combination prevented long_term treatment in this patient population (van Geel et al., 2020; 32147669). A Phase 2 study of dacomitinib in patients with NSCLC who had been previously treated with chemotherapy or erlotinib and were not selected for EGFR mutations reported an ORR of 4.5% (3/66) (Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009).

EGFR T790M, in the presence of a co_occurring activating EGFR alteration, has been associated with clinical resistance to afatinib and has been reported in 33_48% of patients who progressed on the inhibitor across multiple studies (Wu et al., 2016; 26862733, Lee et al., 2019; 30885357, Lin et al., 2019; 30485437, Kaburagi et al., 2018; 29715155, Tanaka et al., 2017; 28978102).

For T790M_positive patients who were TKI_naive or _pretreated, afatinib treatment resulted in ORRs of 24.0% (6/25) and 18.8% (12/64), respectively, in a large_scale retrospective analysis of EGFR_mutated NSCLC (Yang et al., 2020; 31931137). Another large_scale retrospective study of afatinib administered to Asian patients with NSCLC, 99% of whom were previously treated with erlotinib and/or gefitinib, reported an ORR of 21.1% (4/19) for T790M_positive patients and an ORR of 24.4% (105/431) for the entire cohort (Chang et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P1.01_11). For heavily pre_treated patients with erlotinib_ or gefitinib_resistant NSCLC and T790M_positivity, the combination of afatinib with cetuximab enabled an ORR of 31.7% (40/126) in a Phase 1b study (Janjigian et al., 2014; 25074459), and 1/1 PR in a case series (Ribeiro Gomes and Cruz, 2015; 26056478). A patient with T790M_positive NSCLC who progressed on erlotinib experienced a PR to afatinib combined with panitumumab in another case series (Castellanos et al., 2015; 25842367). Afatinib has shown significant clinical activity for patients with NSCLC and the EGFR common sensitizing mutations L858R or exon 19 deletions, based on extensive clinical evidence (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960, Wu et al., 2014; 24439929, Lau et al., 2019; 31178389, Paz_Ares et al., 2017; 28426106, Thongprasert et al., 2019; 31807143, Januszewski et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.13_17).

However, while afatinib significantly increased OS relative to chemotherapy for patients with EGFR exon 19 alterations in these two trials (LUX_Lung 3, 33.3 vs. 21.1 months, HR=0.54; LUX_Lung 6, 31.4 vs. 18.4 months, HR=0.64), no significant OS differences were observed in treatment for patients with L858R mutation (Yang et al., 2015; 25589191). A similar alteration_specific difference was observed for EGFR_mutated treatment_naive NSCLC in a retrospective analysis, which reported numerically longer median OS from second_ versus first_generation EGFR TKIs (48.8 vs. 26.4 months, HR=0.59) for patients with exon 19 deletions, but no substantial difference for patients with L858R (25.4 vs. 20.6 months, HR=0.90) (Lau et al., 2019; 31178389). A Phase 2b study of first_line afatinib compared with gefitinib, also for NSCLC with exon 19 deletions or L858R, reported similar median OS for the two therapies (27.9 vs. 24.5 months, HR=0.86) but significantly longer time_to_treatment_failure (13.7 vs. 11.5 months, HR=0.75) and higher ORR (73% vs. 56%, p=0.0018) with afatinib (Paz_Ares et al., 2017; 28426106). Patients with metastatic NSCLC and common EGFR mutations who progressed on prior chemotherapy experienced an ORR of 50.0% (30/60) from afatinib in a Phase 4 trial (Thongprasert et al., 2019; 31807143). As first_line therapy for NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletions or L858R, prospective or randomized Phase 2 trials have reported a median PFS of 10.2 months and OS of 24.8 months for patients unfit for chemotherapy (Januszewski et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.13_17) and an ORR of 72.5% (n=40, 1 CR), DCR of 100% (40/40), and median PFS and OS of 15.2 and 30.0 months, respectively, for elderly patients \u226570 years old (Suzuki et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_92). A retrospective study of afatinib administered to Asian patients with NSCLC, 99% of whom were previously treated with erlotinib and/or gefitinib, reported an ORR of 27.4% (63/230) for patients with common sensitizing EGFR mutations and an ORR of 24.4% (105/431) for the entire cohort (Chang et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_11). In a case report, a patient with NSCLC with exon 19 deletion and leptomeningeal metastases experienced an ongoing 16_month PR from afatinib in extracranial, brain, and leptomeningeal lesions (Llin\u00e1s_Quintero et al., 2019; 31637072). For patients with erlotinib_ or gefitinib_resistant NSCLC and EGFR mutations, Phase 2/3 studies of afatinib treatment have generally reported ORRs of only 7 to 9% (Miller et al., 2012; 22452896, Chen et al., 2013; 23664448, Katakami et al., 2013; 23816963, Landi et al., 2014; 25242668, De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2015; 25682316, Yang et al., 2015; 26051236); however, DCRs of more than 50% have been observed (De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2015; 25682316). In a Phase 1b or observational study, patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC who progressed on afatinib experienced further clinical benefit from subsequent treatment with afatinib and cetuximab (Horn et al., 2017; 29110849) or osimertinib (Yamamoto et al., 2020; 31863283), respectively. Extensive clinical data have demonstrated that afatinib is effective for patients with EGFR_mutated advanced NSCLC, including exon 19 deletions and L858 mutations, as well as uncommon sensitizing mutations in exons 18 or 20 (Januszewski et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.13_17, Chang et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_11, Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960, Wu et al., 2014; 24439929, Yang et al., 2015; 25589191, Soria et al., 2015; 26156651, Paz_Ares et al., 2017; 28426106). Afatinib has also shown activity for patients with advanced NSCLC and ERBB2 mutations, most of which were exon 20 insertions (Dziadziuszko et al., 2019; 30825613, Lai et al., 2019; 30685684, Greulich et al., 2012; 22908275, Gow et al., 2015; 26134234, Mazi\u00e8res et al., 2016; 26598547, Mazi\u00e8res et al., 2013; 23610105, De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2015; 25682316, De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2012; 22325357, Li et al., 2015; 26559459, Costa et al., 2016; 26964772, Yuan et al., 2020; 32477948, Fang et al., 2019; 31748336). The randomized Phase 3 LUX_Lung 8 trial comparing afatinib with erlotinib as second_line therapy for advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) reported significantly longer median OS (7.9 vs. 6.8 months, HR=0.81), significantly longer median PFS (2.6 vs. 1.9 months, HR=0.81), and higher DCR (51% vs. 40%, p=0.002) for patients treated with afatinib (Soria et al., 2015; 26156651). For patients who progressed on afatinib monotherapy, additional clinical benefit has been reported from afatinib combined with paclitaxel (Schuler et al., 2016; 26646759). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Resistant", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Erlotinib", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Erlotinib is a small_molecule inhibitor of EGFR.

The EGFR T790M mutation, when co_occurring with an EGFR activating alteration, has been associated with resistance to erlotinib and gefitinib (Sequist et al., 2011; 21430269, Pao et al., 2005; 15737014, Kosaka et al., 2006; 17020982, Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> For patients with EGFR_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the Phase 3 EURTAC trial improved PFS with first_line erlotinib relative to platinum_based chemotherapy (9.7 vs. 5.2 months, HR=0.37), though OS was not prolonged (22.9 vs 19.6 months, HR=0.92)(Rosell et al., 2012; 22285168, Leon et al., 2014; doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdu349.52). This study and meta_analyses attribute the lack of OS benefit to the effectiveness of post_progression salvage therapy in the control arm (Lee et al., 2017; 28376144). A Phase 3 study reported similar efficacy of erlotinib and gefitinib for patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC (Yang et al., 2017; 28103612). Patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC have experienced PFS benefit with the addition of bevacizumab to erlotinib in the first_line setting in Phase 3 trials including the ARTEMIS_CTONG1509 trial for Chinese patients (17.9 vs. 11.2 months, HR=0.55)(Zhou et al., 2021; 34388377), the NEJ026 trial for Japanese patients (16.9 vs. 13.3 months, HR=0.605)(Kawashima et al., 2022; 34454653, Saito et al., 2019; 30975627), and the international BEVERLY trial (15.4 vs. 9.7 months, HR=0.60)(Piccirillo et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 12070); OS benefit has not been observed across these studies. In the maintenance setting, Phase 3 trials have reported significantly improved PFS with maintenance erlotinib following first_line platinum_based chemotherapy, with the largest benefit for patients with EGFR mutations (Cappuzzo et al., 2010; 20493771, Faehling et al., 2018; 29687154). In the neoadjuvant setting, a Phase 2 trial reported a numerically improved ORR and significantly longer PFS with erlotinib compared with chemotherapy for patients with EGFR_mutated advanced NSCLC (Zhong et al., 2019; 31194613). In the placebo_controlled Phase 3 RELAY trial, the addition of ramucirumab to erlotinib improved PFS for previously untreated patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR L858R or exon 19 deletion (19.4 vs. 12.4 months, HR=0.59)(Nakagawa et al., 2019; 31591063). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Resistant", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Osimertinib", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Osimertinib is an irreversible EGFR TKI that is selective for EGFR TKI_sensitizing mutations and the EGFR T790M mutation.

In a Phase 3 study for patients with EGFR T790M_positive advanced NSCLC who progressed on EGFR TKI therapy, osimertinib compared with combination platinum therapy led to longer median PFS (10.1 months vs. 4.4 months), including for patients with central nervous system metastases (8.5 vs. 4.2 months). An ORR of 71% was achieved with osimertinib compared to 31% with combination platinum therapy (Mok et al., 2017; 27959700).

Case studies report that 2 patients with T790M_mutated NSCLC achieved durable PRs to osimertinib rechallenge after the adverse events induced by initial osimertinib treatment had been resolved (Miyauchi et al., 2017; 28434520, Yoshida et al., 2017; 28291724). A Phase 2 trial of osimertinib in combination with bevacizumab versus osimertinib monotherapy for patients with untreated advanced non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR del19 or L858R reported no difference in ORR (82% vs 86%) and median PFS (22.1 vs 20.2 months, HR 0.862 p=0.213) (Kenmotsu et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA44).

Phase 3 studies for Japanese patients (Mitsudomi et al., 2010; 20022809, Yoshioka et al., 2019; 31553438) and East Asian patients (Fukuoka et al., 2011; 21670455, Mok et al., 2009; 19692680) with EGFR_mutated NSCLC reported longer PFS but not longer OS on first_line gefitinib compared with cisplatin and docetaxel or carboplatin and paclitaxel.

In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). EGFR L858 is located in the kinase domain and is encoded by exon 21. EGFR L858R has been characterized as activating (Lynch et al., 2004; 15118073, Paez et al., 2004; 15118125, Pao et al., 2004; 15329413) and patients with the L858R mutation have been shown to be sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as erlotinib, gefitinib (Lynch et al., 2004; 15118073, Paez et al., 2004; 15118125, Pao et al., 2004; 15329413), and afatinib (Yang et al., 2015; 25589191). The EGFR T790M mutation, when co_occurring with EGFR activating alterations, has been associated with clinical resistance to gefitinib (Sequist et al., 2011; 21430269, Pao et al., 2005; 15737014, Kosaka et al., 2006; 17020982, Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009), erlotinib (Sequist et al., 2011; 21430269, Pao et al., 2005; 15737014, Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009), dacomitinib (Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009, Janne et al., 2011; 21220471, Yu et al., 2017; 29191595, Ercan et al., 2010; 20118985), and afatinib (Wu et al., 2016; 26862733, Nakamura et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P3.13_18, Lee et al., 2019; 30885357, Lin et al., 2019; 30485437, Kaburagi et al., 2018; 29715155, Tanaka et al., 2017; 28978102), as well as preclinical resistance to lapatinib (Avizienyte et al., 2008; 18588508, Gilmer et al., 2008; 18199554). Rare cases of EGFR T790M without a concurrent activating alteration have been reported (Gazdar et al., 2014; 24736066) and germline T790M mutations have been reported to predispose to familial lung adenocarcinoma (Bell et al., 2005; 16258541, Oxnard et al., 2012; 22588155, Gazdar et al., 2014; 24736066). Limited preclinical data suggests T790M alone is weakly activating, and increased EGFR activity is observed when T790M is expressed with certain activating EGFR alterations (Godin_Heymann et al., 2007; 17671201). Therefore, although this alteration has not been fully characterized, it is likely to result in reduced sensitivity to first_ and second_generation EGFR inhibitors. EGFR mutation has been reported in 12_36% of lung adenocarcinomas (Vallee et al., 2013; 23934203, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079552) and in 4% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2012; 22960745). EGFR protein expression/overexpression has been reported in up to 70% of NSCLC cases (Watzka et al., 2010; 20353893, Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Grob et al., 2013; 23238037, Park et al., 2012; 22207554, Dobashi et al., 2011; 21040950, Ludovini et al., 2013; 23314677). In addition, expression of EGFR protein has been shown to be higher in lung squamous cell carcinoma samples as compared to lung adenocarcinoma (Skrzypski et al., 2013; 23870818, Kim et al., 2012; 22419022). In patients with lung adenocarcinoma, EGFR mutation was a predictor of poor overall survival (Lee et al., 2013; 23525704, Oakley and Chiosea, 2011; 21587084). However, EGFR mutations have been reported to predict improved survival in patients with resected Stage 1_3 lung adenocarcinoma (Marks et al., 2008; 18303429) or resected Stage 1 NSCLC (Izar et al., 2013; 23932319). In a retrospective study of lung adenocarcinoma treated with surgical resection without neoadjuvant TKIs, significantly shorter OS and recurrence_free survival was observed for patients harboring uncommon EGFR mutations (G719X, T790M, or L861R/Q) compared with those harboring only common mutations (L858R or exon 19 deletion) (Hayasaka et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P3.16_03). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer, EGFR activating mutations may predict sensitivity to EGFR TKIs, including erlotinib (Rosell et al., 2011; 22285168), gefitinib (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064), afatinib (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960), dacomitinib (Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), and osimertinib (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549); however, the data for patients with other tumor types are limited (Hong et al., 2020; 32749686, Kim et al., 2015; 26462025, Kim et al., 2015; 25424851, Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840, Cavalieri et al., 2018; 29734047, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Audet et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 6041).

The Phase 1 CHRYSALIS study of amivantamab monotherapy or in combination with lazertinib for the treatment of EGFR_mutated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has produced encouraging preliminary results for treatment_naive patients and patients who relapsed after treatment with osimertinib with and without chemotherapy, including osimertinib_relapsed patients with biomarkers indicating EGFR/MET_based osimertinib resistance (Leighl et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 1192MO, Cho et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 1258O, Bauml et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9006, Shu et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 1193MO). In a Phase 1 trial, the HER3_targeted antibody patritumab deruxtecan elicited an ORR of 39% (22/57, 1 CR) and a median PFS of 8.2 months for patients with non_small cell lung cancer previously treated with an EGFR TKI, many of whom displayed TKI resistance alterations (Janne et al., 2022; 34548309). A Phase 1 trial evaluating the EGFR inhibitor AZD3759 reported a reduction in the volume of brain metastases in 40% (8/20) of patients with previously treated non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring either the EGFR L858R alteration or EGFR exon 19 deletion, including 3 confirmed PRs and 3 unconfirmed PRs (Ahn et al., 2017; 29056570, Yang et al., 2016; 27928026). In a Phase 1/2 trial for advanced NSCLC, the brain_penetrant third_generation EGFR TKI lazertinib enabled ORRs of 54% (69/127) for all evaluable patients and 44% (8/18, intracranial) for patients with brain metastases (Ahn et al., 2019; 31587882). A Phase 1 trial evaluating the irreversible pan_HER inhibitor FCN_411 for NSCLC patients who had EGFR mutations and experienced disease progression on standard treatments reported an ORR of 15% with 10/67 patients achieving PR, and a DCR of 73% with 39 additional patients achieving SD (Lin et al., 2022; 35248866). OR was observed in a numerically higher proportion of patients with the EGFR T790M mutation than those without this mutation (Lin et al., 2022; 35248866). The EGFR T790M mutation, when co_occurring with an EGFR activating alteration, confers clinical resistance to gefitinib (Sequist et al., 2011; 21430269, Pao et al., 2005; 15737014, Kosaka et al., 2006; 17020982, Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009), erlotinib (Sequist et al., 2011; 21430269, Pao et al., 2005; 15737014, Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009), afatinib (Wu et al., 2016; 26862733, Tanaka et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P3.13_22, Nakamura et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P3.13_18, Lee et al., 2019; 30885357, Lin et al., 2019; 30485437, Kaburagi et al., 2018; 29715155), and dacomitinib (Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009, Janne et al., 2011; 21220471, Yu et al., 2017; 29191595, Ercan et al., 2010; 20118985). Preclinical resistance to lapatinib has also been reported (Avizienyte et al., 2008; 18588508, Gilmer et al., 2008; 18199554). Patients with EGFR_mutated non_squamous metastatic non_small cell lung cancer previously treated with EGFR TKI have benefited from immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with anti_angiogenic and chemotherapy, particularly atezolizumab plus bevacizumab plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (OS HR 0.61 compared with bevacizumab/chemotherapy) (Reck et al., 2019; 30922878, Socinski et al., 2021; 34311108, Socinski et al., 2018; 29863955) or sintilimab plus bevacizumab biosimilar plus cisplatin and pemetrexed (PFS HR 0.46 compared with chemotherapy alone) (Lu et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract VP9_2021).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

EGFR T790M, in the presence of a co_occurring activating EGFR alteration, has been associated with clinical resistance to afatinib and has been reported in 33_48% of patients who progressed on the inhibitor across multiple studies (Wu et al., 2016; 26862733, Lee et al., 2019; 30885357, Lin et al., 2019; 30485437, Kaburagi et al., 2018; 29715155, Tanaka et al., 2017; 28978102). Although DCRs of more than 50% have been reported for patients with erlotinib_ or gefitinib_resistant NSCLC treated with afatinib (De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2015; 25682316), including T790M_positive patients (Yang et al., 2015; 26051236), 1 study observed that overall survival for patients with T790M_positive NSCLC was worse than for patients who were T790M_negative (HR=1.79, p=0.005)(He et al., 2017, 27511219). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> Afatinib enabled a DCR of 64.3% (9/14) for patients with advanced T790M_positive NSCLC in a post_hoc analysis of Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials (Yang et al., 2015; 26051236). For T790M_positive patients who were TKI_naive or _pretreated, afatinib treatment resulted in ORRs of 24.0% (6/25) and 18.8% (12/64), respectively, in a large_scale retrospective analysis of EGFR_mutated NSCLC (Yang et al., 2020; 31931137). Another large_scale retrospective study of afatinib administered to Asian patients with NSCLC, 99% of whom were previously treated with erlotinib and/or gefitinib, reported an ORR of 21.1% (4/19) for T790M_positive patients and an ORR of 24.4% (105/431) for the entire cohort (Chang et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P1.01_11). For heavily pre_treated patients with erlotinib_ or gefitinib_resistant NSCLC and T790M_positivity, the combination of afatinib with cetuximab enabled an ORR of 31.7% (40/126) in a Phase 1b study (Janjigian et al., 2014; 25074459), and 1/1 PR in a case series (Ribeiro Gomes and Cruz, 2015; 26056478). A patient with T790M_positive NSCLC who progressed on erlotinib experienced a PR to afatinib combined with panitumumab in another case series (Castellanos et al., 2015; 25842367). Afatinib has shown significant clinical activity for patients with NSCLC and the EGFR common sensitizing mutations L858R or exon 19 deletions, based on extensive clinical evidence (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960, Wu et al., 2014; 24439929, Lau et al., 2019; 31178389, Paz_Ares et al., 2017; 28426106, Thongprasert et al., 2019; 31807143, Januszewski et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.13_17). Two randomized Phase 3 trials reported significantly improved median PFS from afatinib compared with chemotherapy for patients with EGFR common sensitizing mutations (LUX_Lung 3, 13.6 vs. 6.9 months, HR 0.47, p<0.001; LUX_Lung 6, 11.0 vs. 5.6 months, HR 0.28, p<0.0001) (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960, Wu et al., 2014; 24439929). However, while afatinib significantly increased OS relative to chemotherapy for patients with EGFR exon 19 alterations in these two trials (LUX_Lung 3, 33.3 vs. 21.1 months, HR=0.54; LUX_Lung 6, 31.4 vs. 18.4 months, HR=0.64), no significant OS differences were observed in treatment for patients with L858R mutation (Yang et al., 2015; 25589191). A similar alteration_specific difference was observed for EGFR_mutated treatment_naive NSCLC in a retrospective analysis, which reported numerically longer median OS from second_ versus first_generation EGFR TKIs (48.8 vs. 26.4 months, HR=0.59) for patients with exon 19 deletions, but no substantial difference for patients with L858R (25.4 vs. 20.6 months, HR=0.90) (Lau et al., 2019; 31178389). A Phase 2b study of first_line afatinib compared with gefitinib, also for NSCLC with exon 19 deletions or L858R, reported similar median OS for the two therapies (27.9 vs. 24.5 months, HR=0.86) but significantly longer time_to_treatment_failure (13.7 vs. 11.5 months, HR=0.75) and higher ORR (73% vs. 56%, p=0.0018) with afatinib (Paz_Ares et al., 2017; 28426106). Patients with metastatic NSCLC and common EGFR mutations who progressed on prior chemotherapy experienced an ORR of 50.0% (30/60) from afatinib in a Phase 4 trial (Thongprasert et al., 2019; 31807143). As first_line therapy for NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletions or L858R, prospective or randomized Phase 2 trials have reported a median PFS of 10.2 months and OS of 24.8 months for patients unfit for chemotherapy (Januszewski et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.13_17) and an ORR of 72.5% (n=40, 1 CR), DCR of 100% (40/40), and median PFS and OS of 15.2 and 30.0 months, respectively, for elderly patients \u226570 years old (Suzuki et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_92). A retrospective study of afatinib administered to Asian patients with NSCLC, 99% of whom were previously treated with erlotinib and/or gefitinib, reported an ORR of 27.4% (63/230) for patients with common sensitizing EGFR mutations and an ORR of 24.4% (105/431) for the entire cohort (Chang et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_11). In a case report, a patient with NSCLC with exon 19 deletion and leptomeningeal metastases experienced an ongoing 16_month PR from afatinib in extracranial, brain, and leptomeningeal lesions (Llin\u00e1s_Quintero et al., 2019; 31637072). For patients with erlotinib_ or gefitinib_resistant NSCLC and EGFR mutations, Phase 2/3 studies of afatinib treatment have generally reported ORRs of only 7 to 9% (Miller et al., 2012; 22452896, Chen et al., 2013; 23664448, Katakami et al., 2013; 23816963, Landi et al., 2014; 25242668, De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2015; 25682316, Yang et al., 2015; 26051236); however, DCRs of more than 50% have been observed (De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2015; 25682316). In a Phase 1b or observational study, patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC who progressed on afatinib experienced further clinical benefit from subsequent treatment with afatinib and cetuximab (Horn et al., 2017; 29110849) or osimertinib (Yamamoto et al., 2020; 31863283), respectively. Extensive clinical data have demonstrated that afatinib is effective for patients with EGFR_mutated advanced NSCLC, including exon 19 deletions and L858 mutations, as well as uncommon sensitizing mutations in exons 18 or 20 (Januszewski et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.13_17, Chang et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract P1.01_11, Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960, Wu et al., 2014; 24439929, Yang et al., 2015; 25589191, Soria et al., 2015; 26156651, Paz_Ares et al., 2017; 28426106). Afatinib has also shown activity for patients with advanced NSCLC and ERBB2 mutations, most of which were exon 20 insertions (Dziadziuszko et al., 2019; 30825613, Lai et al., 2019; 30685684, Greulich et al., 2012; 22908275, Gow et al., 2015; 26134234, Mazi\u00e8res et al., 2016; 26598547, Mazi\u00e8res et al., 2013; 23610105, De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2015; 25682316, De Gr\u00e8ve et al., 2012; 22325357, Li et al., 2015; 26559459, Costa et al., 2016; 26964772, Yuan et al., 2020; 32477948, Fang et al., 2019; 31748336). The randomized Phase 3 LUX_Lung 8 trial comparing afatinib with erlotinib as second_line therapy for advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) reported significantly longer median OS (7.9 vs. 6.8 months, HR=0.81), significantly longer median PFS (2.6 vs. 1.9 months, HR=0.81), and higher DCR (51% vs. 40%, p=0.002) for patients treated with afatinib (Soria et al., 2015; 26156651).

This study and meta_analyses attribute the lack of OS benefit to the effectiveness of post_progression salvage therapy in the control arm (Lee et al., 2017; 28376144). A Phase 3 study reported similar efficacy of erlotinib and gefitinib for patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC (Yang et al., 2017; 28103612). Patients with EGFR_mutated NSCLC have experienced PFS benefit with the addition of bevacizumab to erlotinib in the first_line setting in Phase 3 trials including the ARTEMIS_CTONG1509 trial for Chinese patients (17.9 vs. 11.2 months, HR=0.55)(Zhou et al., 2021; 34388377), the NEJ026 trial for Japanese patients (16.9 vs. 13.3 months, HR=0.605)(Kawashima et al., 2022; 34454653, Saito et al., 2019; 30975627), and the international BEVERLY trial (15.4 vs. 9.7 months, HR=0.60)(Piccirillo et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 12070); OS benefit has not been observed across these studies.

In the Phase 3 ADAURA study, patients with early Stage (IB/II/IIIA) EGFR_mutated NSCLC experienced longer PFSs on osimertinib compared to placebo in the adjuvant setting (not reached vs. 28.1 months; HR=0.21)(Herbst et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract LBA5). A Phase 1 study reported that T790M_negative patients with acquired EGFR TKI resistance experienced an ORR of 21% and a median PFS of 2.8 months (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549). A Phase 1b/2 study evaluating osimertinib in combination with the CD73 inhibitor oleclumab for patients with advanced EGFR_mutated, T790M_negative NSCLC reported an ORR of 19% (4/19), a DCR of 81%, and mPFS of 11 months (Kim et al., 2021 AACR Abstract CT163). In a Phase 3 study for patients with EGFR T790M_positive advanced NSCLC who progressed on EGFR TKI therapy, osimertinib compared with combination platinum therapy led to longer median PFS (10.1 months vs. 4.4 months), including for patients with central nervous system metastases (8.5 vs. 4.2 months). An ORR of 71% was achieved with osimertinib compared to 31% with combination platinum therapy (Mok et al., 2017; 27959700).

Case studies report that 2 patients with T790M_mutated NSCLC achieved durable PRs to osimertinib rechallenge after the adverse events induced by initial osimertinib treatment had been resolved (Miyauchi et al., 2017; 28434520, Yoshida et al., 2017; 28291724). A Phase 2 trial of osimertinib in combination with bevacizumab versus osimertinib monotherapy for patients with untreated advanced non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR del19 or L858R reported no difference in ORR (82% vs 86%) and median PFS (22.1 vs 20.2 months, HR 0.862 p=0.213) (Kenmotsu et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA44). The Phase 2 BOOSTER study of osimertinib in combination with bevacizumab versus osimertinib monotherapy for patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR_sensitizing mutations (exon 19 del or L858R) and L790M at progression on prior EGFR TKI reported no difference in ORR (55% vs 55%), median OS (24.0 vs 24.3 months, HR 1.03 p=0.91), or median PFS (15.4 vs 12.3 months, HR 0.96 p=0.83), although improved PFS was observed for the combination in the subgroup of current or former smokers (16.5 vs 8.4, HR 0.52) while nonsmokers had no benefit (HR 1.47) (Soo et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract VP3_2021). The Phase 1b TATTON study of osimertinib in combination with selumetinib, savolitinib, or durvalumab for patients with previously treated EGFR_mutated NSCLC reported ORRs of 42% (15/36), 44% (8/18), and 44% (10/23), respectively (Oxnard et al., 2020; 32139298). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Gefitinib", "FDAApproved": "true", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Gefitinib targets the tyrosine kinase EGFR and is FDA approved to treat non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations in EGFR.

The EGFR T790M mutation, when co_occurring with an EGFR activating alteration, has been associated with resistance to erlotinib and gefitinib (Sequist et al., 2011; 21430269, Pao et al., 2005; 15737014, Kosaka et al., 2006; 17020982, Reckamp et al., 2014; 24501009). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> Gefitinib achieved an ORR of 69.8% and OS of 19.2 months as first_line treatment for Caucasian patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and EGFR sensitizing mutations (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064). Phase 3 studies for Japanese patients (Mitsudomi et al., 2010; 20022809, Yoshioka et al., 2019; 31553438) and East Asian patients (Fukuoka et al., 2011; 21670455, Mok et al., 2009; 19692680) with EGFR_mutated NSCLC reported longer PFS but not longer OS on first_line gefitinib compared with cisplatin and docetaxel or carboplatin and paclitaxel. Retrospective analysis of East Asian patients receiving first_line gefitinib reported greatest PFS benefit among patients with EGFR exon 19 insertions or deletions and shortest PFS for those with exon 20 insertions (1.2 months)(Sutiman et al., 2017; 27908825). Two Phase 3 trials of the combination gefitinib plus pemetrexed and carboplatin compared with gefitinib alone for patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR activating mutations reported significantly higher ORRs (75.3% and 84% vs. 62.5% and 67%), longer median PFS (16 and 20.9 months vs. 8 and 11.9 months), and longer median OS (50.9 months and not reached vs. 17 and 38.8 months) with combination treatment; however, combination treatment was associated with increased Grade 3 or higher adverse events (Noronha et al., 2019; 31411950, Hosomi et al., 2020; 31682542).

High bTMB levels were not detected in this sample. It is unclear whether the bTMB levels in this sample would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Depending on the clinical context, TMB testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. NSCLC harbors a median bTMB of 16.8 Muts/Mb (range 1.9_52.5 Muts/Mb)(Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950). Retrospective analysis of the Phase 3 OAK and Phase 2 POPLAR trials for patients with advanced or metastatic non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) reported that bTMB \u22657 Muts/Mb was associated with shorter PFS (2.8 vs. 4.2 months) and OS (7.4 vs. 11.9 months) compared with bTMB <7 Muts/Mb for patients treated with docetaxel (Nie et al., 2020; 32380463). In one study of advanced NSCLC in China, bTMB \u22656 Muts/Mb was associated with decreased PFS (10 vs. 18 months) and OS (11 vs. 25 months) compared with bTMB <6 Muts/Mb for patients treated with platinum_based chemotherapy (Ma et al., 2021; 34055609). A meta_analysis of 19 studies of immune checkpoint inhibitor_treated NSCLC (n = 2,315 patients) demonstrated that high TMB predicted a significantly longer OS than low TMB (HR = 0.70), and within the high TMB group, immunotherapy was associated with an improved PFS (HR = 0.62, P<0.001), OS (HR = 0.67, P<0.001) and a higher response rate (OR = 2.35, P<0.001) compared to chemotherapy (Meng et al., 2022; 35113949). In contrast, a large study of Chinese patients with untreated lung adenocarcinoma reported a shorter median OS for tumors with a higher number of mutations in a limited gene set compared with a lower mutation number (48.4 vs. 61.0 months)(Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843). Another study of patients with NSCLC treated with EGFR inhibitors or platinum doublet chemotherapy found elevated TMB to be correlated with poorer prognosis, as well as finding lower TMB in combination with PD_L1 negative status to be significantly associated with longer median survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). However, no significant prognostic association of TMB and/or PD_L1 status with survival has been reported in patients with lung SCC (Yu et al., 2019; 30253973, Chen et al., 2019; 31088500). On the basis of clinical evidence in NSCLC and HSNCC, increased bTMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511) and anti_PD_1 (Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074) therapies. In NSCLC, multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 to 16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). In HNSCC, a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Cannot Be Determined", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Cannot Be Determined"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The level of MSI in this sample could not be determined with confidence. Depending on the clinical context, MSI testing of an alternate sample or by another methodology could be considered. MSI_H is generally infrequent in NSCLC, reported in fewer than 1% of samples across several large studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197, Ninomiya et al., 2006; 16641899, Vanderwalde et al., 2018; 29436178, Zang et al., 2019; 31270941, Dudley et al., 2016; 26880610, Takamochi et al., 2017; 28676214, Schrock et al., 2017; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2016.11.487), whereas data on the reported incidence of MSI_H in SCLC has been limited and conflicting (Pylkkanen et al., 1997; 9329646, Gonzalez et al., 2000; 11061602, Chen et al., 1996; 8782463, Merlo et al., 1994; 8174113). One study reported MSI_H in lung adenocarcinoma patients with smoking history, and 3 of 4 MSI_H patients examined also had metachronous carcinomas in other organs, although this has not been investigated in large scale studies (Warth et al., 2016; 26637197). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of MSI in NSCLC are limited (PubMed, Oct 2021).

The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with elevated tumor fraction values have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus high sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at low risk of false negative results. However, if elevated tumor fraction is not detected, it does not exclude the presence of disease burden or compromise the confidence of reported alterations. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels.
