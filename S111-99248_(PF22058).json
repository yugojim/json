CDK4 and its functional homolog CDK6 are activated by D_type cyclins and promote cell cycle progression by inactivating the tumor suppressor Rb (Weinberg et al., 1995; 7736585, Musgrove et al., 2011; 21734724). Amplification of the chromosomal region that includes CDK4 has been reported in multiple cancer types, including lung cancer, glioblastoma, and liposarcoma, and has been associated with overexpression of CDK4 protein (Wikman et al., 2005; 15543620, Rao et al., 2010; 19609742, Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Chung et al., 2009; 19574885, Ragazzini et al., 2004; 15024701, Dujardin et al., 2011; 21336260, Zhang et al., 2013; 23393200, Horvai et al., 2009; 19734852). Across TCGA and MKSCC studies, CDK4 amplification has been reported in 4.0_9.4% of glioma cases and 14% of glioblastoma multiforme cases (cBioPortal, Sep 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210, cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031, Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661). A study has reported amplification of the 12q14_15 region, where CDK4 and MDM2 reside, in 5% (2/42) of glioblastomas (Zheng et al., 2013; 23796897). Amplification of CDK4 and corresponding increased CDK4 protein expression has been reported to be associated with a poorer patient outcome in anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma (Kim et al., 2010; 20080666, Ruano et al., 2009; 19141386, Fischer et al., 2008; 18403636, B\u00e4cklund et al., 2005; 15970925). CDK4 amplification or activation may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors such as abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib (Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27217383, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767). Clinical benefit has been reported for limited tumor types including patients with CDK4_amplified liposarcoma and sarcoma in response to treatment with abemaciclib (Dickson et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 11004), palbociclib (Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Dickson et al., 2016; 27124835), and ribociclib (Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04282031", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03239015", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04594005", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04391595", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02933736", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03994796", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04116541", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03158389", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02981940", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "EGFR", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "exon 20 insertion (N771_P772insNN)", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "exon 20 insertion (N771_P772insNN)"}}, "Interpretation": "EGFR encodes the epidermal growth factor receptor, which belongs to a class of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases. In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). EGFR alterations such as observed here are in_frame insertions into exon 20 of EGFR, in the loop following the C_helix of the kinase domain (Yasuda et al., 2012; 21764376); these alterations have been shown to be activating (Lee et al., 2019; 31108249). Insertions in exon 20 are predicted to force the kinase into an active conformation (Tu et al., 2017; 29173773, Kuiper et al., 2016; 27875527, Naidoo et al., 2015; 26096453, Wu et al., 2019; 31327643, Sasaki et al., 2011; 21791641, Arcila et al., 2013; 23371856, Eck and Yun, 2010; 20026433, Yasuda et al., 2012; 21764376, Janne et al., 2011; 21220471, Kosaka, et al., 2017; 28363995, Heigener et al., 2015; 26354527, Yang et al., 2015; 26051236, Wu et al., 2019; 31327643). EGFR exon 20 insertions that occur closer to the C_terminus, such as those affecting D770 and N771, appear more likely to be resistant to reversible EGFR inhibitors, compared with insertions occurring earlier in exon 20 (Yasuda et al., 2012; 21764376). EGFR alterations have been reported in 13.2% of anaplastic astrocytomas, 5.3_15.9% of glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs), and 0% of pilocytic astrocytomas in several genomic studies of CNS tumors (cbio_Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031, cbio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, cbio_Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, cbio_Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509). In GBMs, Missense mutations in the EGFR extracellular domain have been found in 10_15% of cases and approximately half have a low_level amplification of the mutated allele (Lee et al., 2006; 17177598, Vivanco et al., 2012; 22588883). In a study of IDH_wildtype GBM samples, EGFR alterations were detected in 50% (117/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed, including 41% (95/232) with a co_occurring EGFR amplification and mutation, 26% (61/232) with an EGFR domain truncation event, such as EGFRvIII, and 2.2% (5/232) with an EGFR fusion event (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). No definitive correlation has been identified between EGFR amplification and length of survival in patients with GBM (Srividya et al., 2010; 20702468, Das et al., 2011; 20888234); however, EGFR amplification has been associated with prolonged survival in patients over the age of 60 with GBM (Smith et al., 2001; 11504770). The EGFR/MET bispecific antibody amivantamab (Sabari et al., 2020; WCLC Abstract OA04.04), the novel second_generation EGFR TKI poziotinib (Heymach et al., 2018; IASLC WCLC Abstract OA02.06, Cornelissen et al., 2020; IASCL WCLC Abstract MA11.04, Le et al., 2020; AACR Abstract CT081), and dual EGFR/HER2 kinase inhibitors such as mobocertinib (Ramalingam et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9014) and DZD9008 (Yang et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9008) have demonstrated efficacy for NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertions. For patients with non_small cell lung cancer, EGFR activating mutations may predict sensitivity to EGFR TKIs, including erlotinib (Rosell et al., 2011; 22285168), gefitinib (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064), afatinib (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960), dacomitinib (Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), and osimertinib (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549); however, the data for patients with other tumor types are limited (Hong et al., 2020; 32749686, Kim et al., 2015; 26462025, Kim et al., 2015; 25424851, Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840, Cavalieri et al., 2018; 29734047, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Audet et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 6041). A case study of a patient with multiple glioblastoma (GBM) tumors, one of which harbored EGFR amplification and multiple missense mutations, reported a near_CR of the EGFR_amplified and _mutated tumor to osimertinib (Makhlin et al., 2019; 31769726). A case series of 11 patients with bithalamic gliomas with EGFR mutations suggested that treatment with EGFR inhibitors, including osimertinib, prolonged patient survival relative to other types of treatment; however, no patients attained PR or SD (Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840). Another case series of 2 patients with osimertinib_treated bithalamic gliomas with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations reported that one patient experienced no progression at 4 months of treatment and that another patient did not progress until after 6 months of treatment (Goyal et al., 2021; 33940677). Both clinical and preclinical evidence suggest that insertions in the loop following the C_helix, such as alterations observed here, confer resistance to both irreversible and reversible EGFR inhibitors (Tu et al., 2017; 29173773, Kuiper et al., 2016; 27875527, Naidoo et al., 2015; 26096453, Wu et al., 2019; 31327643, Sasaki et al., 2011; 21791641, Arcila et al., 2013; 23371856, Eck and Yun, 2010; 20026433, Yasuda et al., 2012; 21764376, Janne et al., 2011; 21220471, Kosaka, et al., 2017; 28363995, Heigener et al., 2015; 26354527, Yang et al., 2015; 26051236, Wu et al., 2019; 31327643). In particular, these insertions have been associated with lack of response to erlotinib and gefitinib in patients and preclinical studies (Greulich et al., 2005; 16187797, Yuza et al., 2007; 17495523, Li et al., 2008; 18408761, Yasuda et al., 2013; 24353160, Arcila et al., 2013; 23371856, Harada et al., 2011; 21132006, Wu et al., 2008; 18676761, Sequist et al., 2008; 18458038, Sasaki et al., 2007; 17686547, Beau_Faller et al., 2014; 24285021, Woo et al., 2014; 25146938, Khan et al., 2014; 25202264), although 1 patient with the H773_V774dupHV mutation experienced a PR on combination treatment with gefitinib and chemotherapy (Arcila et al., 2013; 23371856); SD has been observed in 2 patients with the H773dup mutation and 1 patient with the N771>SY mutation (Beau_Faller et al., 2014; 24285021). Structural data also predict that this alteration would not respond to the reversible pan_ERBB inhibitor lapatinib (Wood et al., 2004; 15374980, Kumar et al., 2008; 18375904). Clinical trials and case studies of afatinib in patients with NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertions have reported an ORR of only 11% (3/27) and a DCR of 15_22% (4/27 to 6/27), with median PFS of 2.7 months and median OS of 9.2 months (Yang et al., 2015; 26051236, Cai et al., 2019; 30608413, Heigener et al., 2015; 26354527). However, a study of afatinib for patients with NSCLC after previous failure on erlotinib and/or gefitinib reported a median time to treatment failure (mTTF) of 18.9 months and an ORR of 43% for the subset of patients with tumors harboring EGFR exon 20 insertions; the mTTF and ORR were numerically higher than those for patients with tumors harboring other EGFR mutations (Chang et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P1.01_11). Therefore, the efficacy of afatinib against these alterations is unclear. The activity of osimertinib for exon 20 insertions is unclear, although objective responses have been reported in retrospective and case studies for a subset of patients with NSCLC and these alterations (Piotrowska et al., 2018; 30244855, Fang et al., 2019; 31208370, Murano et al., 2019; 31645848).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

A patient with EGFR_mutated metastatic lacrimal gland adenoid cystic carcinoma experienced clinical benefit from erlotinib treatment that was ongoing at 14 months (Nie et al., 2018; 29998897). A clinical study of patients with glioblastoma (GBM) treated with gefitinib or erlotinib found that 9/49 (18%) had tumor shrinkage of 25% or more; in this study, the extracellular domain EGFRvIII mutation was correlated with response (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176). In a Phase 2 study of 65 patients with GBM or gliosarcoma, treatment with erlotinib, temozolomide, and radiotherapy resulted in longer progression_free survival relative to a historical control study utilizing a regimen of temozolomide and radiotherapy alone (19.3 months vs. 14.1 months)(Prados et al., 2009; 19075262). However, in a Phase 1/2 trial of erlotinib monotherapy in 11 patients with relapsed or refractory GBM or anaplastic astrocytoma, all patients showed disease progression and the drug showed significant toxicity (Kesavabhotla et al., 2012; 22946346). In addition, a Phase 2 trial of patients with recurrent or progressive GBM treated with erlotinib and sorafenib did not meet its objective of a 30% increase in overall survival time compared with historical controls; sorafenib was found to increase erlotinib clearance (Peereboom et al., 2013; 23328813). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Resistant", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Gefitinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Gefitinib targets the tyrosine kinase EGFR and is FDA approved to treat non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations in EGFR.

However, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of gefitinib combined with radiotherapy in 178 patients with GBM reported no overall survival benefit of added gefitinib, and EGFR expression was found to be of no prognostic value for patients treated with gefitinib plus radiotherapy (Chakravarti et al., 2013; 23182702). A Phase 2 trial of preoperative gefitinib treatment in patients with recurrent GBM reported that although EGFR phosphorylation was decreased in treated patients as compared to the control group, measurement of 12 downstream molecules revealed no significant changes (Hegi et al., 2011; 21471286). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Resistant", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT03783403", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04720976", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04172597", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02800486", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02861898", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "MDM2", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "MDM2 encodes an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p53, Rb1, and other proteins (Sdek et al., 2005; 16337594, Brady et al., 2005; 15632057, Li et al., 2004; 15053880). MDM2 acts to prevent the activity of the tumor suppressor p53; therefore, overexpression or amplification of MDM2 may be oncogenic (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675, Cordon_Cardo et al., 1994; 8306343). Overexpression or amplification of MDM2 is frequent in cancer (Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). Although two retrospective clinical studies suggest that MDM2 amplification may predict a short time_to_treatment failure on anti_PD_1/PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors, with 4/5 patients with MDM2 amplification (Kato et al., 2017; 28351930) and 2/3 patients with MDM2 or MDM4 amplification (Singavi et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 1140PD) experiencing tumor hyperprogression, amplification of MDM2 or MDM4 was not associated with shorter progression_free survival (PFS) in a retrospective analysis of non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) outcomes with immune checkpoint inhibitors (hazard ratio of 1.4, p=0.44)(Rizvi et al., 2018; 29337640). The latter study reported PFS of >2 months for 5/8 patients with MDM2/MDM4 amplification (Rizvi et al., 2018; 29337640). In the Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) TCGA dataset, amplification of MDM2 has been found in 8% of cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). A study has reported amplification of the 12q14_15 region, where MDM2 and CDK4 reside, in 5% (2/42) of GBMs (Zheng et al., 2013; 23796897). Amplification of MDM2 has been associated with poor survival in patients with glioblastoma (Fischer et al., 2010; 19839052, Zheng et al., 2013; 23796897). MDM2 antagonists disrupt the MDM2_p53 interaction, thereby stabilizing p53 (Cheok et al., 2011; 20975744). Preclinical studies have suggested that the amplification of MDM2, in the absence of concurrent TP53 mutations, may increase sensitivity to these agents (Ohnstad et al., 2013; 23165797, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357). Preliminary Phase 1 studies of the MDM2_p53 antagonist alrizomadlin (APG_115) reported a PR in a patient with liposarcoma harboring an MDM2 amplification and wildtype for TP53 and SD in 21%\u201338% (6/28 and 5/13, respectively) of patients in genomically unselected solid tumors (Zhang et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3124, Rasco et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3126). A Phase 2 trial of alrizomadlin in combination with pembrolizumab reported a PR in 1 of 3 patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor that had failed standard therapy, as well as PRs in patients with multiple types of solid tumors that had failed immunotherapy, including 1 out of 14 patients with non_small cell lung cancer; 1 out of 5 patients with urothelial carcinoma; and 2 out of5, 1 out of 5, and 1 out of 11 patients with mucosal, uveal, and cutaneous melanoma, respectively (Tolcher et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 2506). Phase 1b studies of the MDM2 inhibitor idasanutlin for refractory AML in combination with cytarabine or venetoclax reported anti_leukemic response rates of 33% (25/75) and 37% (11/30), respectively (Martinelli et al., 2016; EHA21 Abstract S504, Daver et al., 2018; ASH Abstract 767); clinical benefit (58% ORR, 7/12) with idasanutlin monotherapy has been reported for patients with polycythemia vera (Mascarenhas et al., 2019; ASH Abstract 134). The dual MDM2/MDM4 inhibitor ALRN_6924 led to an ORR of 27% (4/15) for patients with TP53 wildtype peripheral T_cell lymphoma in a Phase 2 study (Shustov et al., 2018; ASH Abstract 1623); responses have also been observed in TP53 wildtype AML, MDS, Merkel cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and liposarcoma (Sallman et al., 2018; ASH Abstract 4066, Meric_Bernstam et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 2505).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Inhibitors of the MDM2_p53 interaction are being tested in clinical trials.

Loss of PIK3R1 has been shown to result in increased PI3K signaling (Taniguchi et al., 2010; 20530665, Luo et al., 2006; 16679293, Ueki et al., 2003; 14504291, Mauvais_Jarvis et al., 2002; 11781359), promote tumorigenesis (Taniguchi et al., 2010; 20530665, Thorpe et al., 2017; 28630349, Li et al., 2019; 30755611), and promote hyperplasia in the context of PTEN_deficiency (Luo et al., 2005; 16006513). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt PIK3R1 function or expression (Jaiswal et al., 2009; 19962665, Cheung et al., 2011; 21984976, Ko et al., 2014; 24651434, Quayle et al., 2012; 23166678, Sun et al., 2010; 20713702, Wu et al., 2009; 19915146, Urick et al., 2011; 21478295, Huang et al., 2007; 18079394, Bousquet et al., 2006; 16917505, Oliver et al., 2017; 28143957, Philp et al., 2001; 11606375, Lucas et al., 2014; 25488983, Chen et al., 2018; 29636477, Cheung et al., 2014; 25284480, Li et al., 2021; 34507989). One study detected PIK3R1 mutation in 10% (24/232) of IDH_wildtype glioblastoma (GBM) samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). In the TCGA datasets, PIK3R1 mutation is most frequently observed in endometrial carcinoma (33%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2013; 23636398), glioblastoma (GBM; 11%)(cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142), uterine carcinosarcoma (11%)(cBioPortal, Jan 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210), and lower grade glioma (5%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751). PIK3R1 is often inactivated by in_frame insertions or deletions (indels), and the majority of this class of mutation (80%) was observed in endometrial carcinoma (Ye et al., 2016; 26657142, Cheung et al., 2011; 21984976, Urick et al., 2011; 21478295), although PIK3R1 indels have been reported in other cancer types such as GBM, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, and urothelial bladder carcinoma (Ye et al., 2016; 26657142). On the basis of limited clinical data, reduced PIK3R1 expression has been associated with reduced disease_free survival in prostate cancer (Munkley et al., 2015; 26501081) and metastasis_free survival in breast cancer (Cizkova et al., 2013; 24229379). PIK3R1 expression is not associated with overall survival in neuroendocrine tumors (Qian et al., 2013; 23980085). On the basis of clinical (Matulonis et al., 2015; 25528496, Piha_Paul et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 2516, Pitz et al., 2015; 25605819, Juric et al., 2016; SABCS Abstract P3_14_01) and preclinical (Thorpe et al., 2017; 28630349, Sun et al., 2010; 20713702) data, PIK3R1 alteration may predict sensitivity to pan_PI3K or PI3K_alpha_selective inhibitors. In patients with PIK3R1 mutation and no other alterations in the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway, 2 CRs have been achieved by patients with endometrial cancer treated with the pan_PI3K inhibitor pilaralisib (Matulonis et al., 2015; 25528496), and 1 PR has been achieved by a patient with breast cancer treated with the PI3K_alpha inhibitor alpelisib in combination with ribociclib and letrozole (Juric et al., 2016; SABCS Abstract P3_14_01). Limited clinical and preclinical data suggest that PIK3R1 alterations may also be sensitive to inhibitors of mTOR (Groisberg et al., ASCO 2017; Abstract 2582, Basho et al., 2015; European Cancer Congress Abstract 1871, Basho et al., 2017; 27893038, Myers et al., 2016; 27016228, Day et al., 2019; 30420444, Sun et al., 2010; 20713702, Ou et al., 2014; 25193464) or AKT (Groisberg et al., ASCO 2017; Abstract 2582, Li et al., 2019; 30755611, Quayle et al., 2012; 23166678).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). Low_level MSI has been reported in 5_9% of glioblastoma (GBM) samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927, Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285, Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). A large_scale study did not find high_level microsatellite instability (MSI_H) in any of 129 GBM samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), although a small_scale study reported MSI_H in 4 of 15 pediatric GBMs and 1 of 12 adult GBMs (Szybka et al., 2003; 12908754). The frequency of MSI has been reported to be increased in relapsed compared to primary GBM (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), in GBMs with a previous lower grade astrocytoma (Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285), and in giant cell GBM compared to classic GBM (Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TERT", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "promoter _124C>T", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "promoter _124C>T"}}, "Interpretation": "Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT, or hTERT) is a catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex, which is required to maintain appropriate chromosomal length (Shay et al., 2011; 22015685). Activation of TERT is a hallmark of cancer, being detected in up to 80_90% of malignancies and absent in quiescent cells (Shay et al., 1997; 9282118, Kim et al., 1994; 7605428, Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000; 10647931). Mutations within the promoter region of TERT that confer enhanced TERT promoter activity have been reported in two hotspots, located at _124 bp and _146 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (also termed C228T and C250T, respectively)(Horn et al., 2013; 23348503, Huang et al., 2014; 23348506, Vinagre et al., 2013; 23887589), as well as tandem mutations at positions \u2013124/\u2013125 bp and \u2013138/\u2013139 bp (Horn et al., 2013; 23348503). TERT promoter mutations have been reported in 51_59% of gliomas (Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Killela et al., 2014; 24722048), most frequently in glioblastoma (GBM, 54_84%), gliosarcoma (81%), oligodendroglioma (78%), and historically in oligoastrocytomas (25_31%) but less frequently in lower grade astrocytomas (10_18%) and in only 1% of ependymomas (Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Liu et al., 2013; 23603989, Koelsche et al., 2013; 24154961, Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Killela et al., 2014; 24722048). In patients with glioblastoma (GBM), the prevalence of TERT promoter mutation is lower in pediatric primary GBM (11%) and adult secondary GBM (28%) compared with adult primary GBM (58_83%) (Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Killela et al., 2013; 23530248). One study detected TERT promoter mutations in 78% (181/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). TERT promoter mutation has been shown to be significantly associated with increased TERT gene expression in astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and GBM (Arita et al., 2013; 23764841). TERT promoter mutations significantly associate with poor prognosis in patients with GBM, although this correlation may be due to the association with primary GBM as opposed to IDH_positive secondary GBM (Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Reitman et al., 2013; 24217890, Arita et al., 2013; 23764841). In the context of IDH_wildtype glioma, TERT mutations are associated with reduced OS (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021). Therapeutic options for targeting tumors with TERT mutations are limited, although a variety of approaches have been investigated, including immunotherapies using TERT as a tumor_associated antigen and antisense oligonucleotide_ or peptide_based therapies. TERT peptide vaccines showed limited anticancer efficacy in clinical trials (Zanetti et al., 2017; 27245281); however, in one preclinical study, the combination of a TERT peptide vaccine and anti_CTLA_4 therapy suppressed tumor growth (Duperret at al., 2018; 29249395). A Phase 2 study of the TERT inhibitor imetelstat for patients with advanced non_small cell lung cancer reported no improvement in PFS or OS (Chiappori et al., 2015; 25467017). TERT mutations are associated with 1p/19q co_deletion in oligodendrogliomas, and are highly recurrent in IDH/ATRX_wildtype glioblastoma (GBM) (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021)(Weller et al., 2020; 33293629). The presence of EGFR gene amplification or TERT promoter mutations are indicative of diffuse astrocytic glioma with molecular features of glioblastoma, WHO grade 4 in IDH1/2_wildtype tumors (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021) (Louis et al., 2021; 34185076).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "03", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "03"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Touat et al., 2020; 32322066, Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556, Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642). Glioblastoma (GBM) harbors a median TMB of 2.7 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 4.2% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). For pediatric patients, high TMB has been reported in a subset of high_grade gliomas, frequently in association with mutations in mismatch repair or proofreading genes and in TP53, whereas BRAF alterations or other oncogene fusions were observed more frequently in brain tumors harboring low TMB (Patel et al., 2020; 32386112, Johnson et al., 2017; 28912153). Increased TMB has been reported to correlate with higher tumor grade in glioma (Draaisma et al., 2015; 26699864) and glioblastoma (GBM) tissue samples with biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD) (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570), as well as with shorter OS of patients with diffuse glioma (Wang et al., 2020; 32164609). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In glioma, a lack of association between TMB and clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors has been reported (Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Touat et al., 2020; 32322066). However, multiple case studies have reported that patients with ultramutated gliomas driven by POLE mutations have benefited from treatment with anti_PD_1 (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556) or anti_PD_L1 (Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642) therapies. Therefore, although increased TMB alone may not be a strong biomarker for PD_1 or PD_L1 inhibitors in this cancer type, these agents may have efficacy for patients with glioma harboring both high TMB and POLE mutation.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "CDK4", "Alteration": "amplification", "Title": "A Study of BPI_1178 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor and HR+/HER2_ Breast Cancer", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1/2", "Target": "CDK6, CDK4, ER, Aromatase", "Locations": "Shanghai (China)", "NCTID": "NCT04282031", "Note": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "CDK4", "Alteration": "amplification", "Title": "Efficacy and Safety of Targeted Precision Therapy in Refractory Tumor With Druggable Molecular Event", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "EGFR, ERBB4, ERBB2, PARP, mTOR, MET, ROS1, RET, VEGFRs, BRAF, CDK4, CDK6", "Locations": "Shanghai (China)", "NCTID": "NCT03239015", "Note": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "CDK4", "Alteration": "amplification", "Title": "CDK4/6 Tumor, Abemaciclib, Paclitaxel", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1/2", "Target": "CDK4, CDK6", "Locations": "Seoul (Korea, Republic of)", "NCTID": "NCT04594005", "Note": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "CDK4", "Alteration": "amplification", "Title": "LY3214996 Plus Abemaciclib in Recurrent Glioblastoma Patients", "StudyPhase": "PHASE null", "Target": "CDK4, CDK6, ERK1, ERK2", "Locations": "Arizona", "NCTID": "NCT04391595", "Note": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "CDK4", "Alteration": "amplification", "Title": "Ribociclib (LEE011) in Preoperative Glioma and Meningioma Patients", "StudyPhase": "PHASE null", "Target": "CDK6, CDK4", "Locations": "Arizona", "NCTID": "NCT02933736", "Note": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "CDK4", "Alteration": "amplification", "Title": "Safety and Oversight of the Individually Tailored Treatment Approach: A Novel Pilot Study", "StudyPhase": "PHASE null", "Target": "CDK4, CDK6, PI3K_alpha, PD_L1, MEK, PARP, PD_1, BRAF", "Locations": "Melbourne (Australia)", "NCTID": "NCT04801966", "Note": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "CDK4", "Alteration": "amplification", "Title": "Genetic Testing in Guiding Treatment for Patients With Brain Metastases", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "TRKB, ALK, TRKC, ROS1, TRKA, CDK4, CDK6, PI3K, mTOR", "Locations": "Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana", "NCTID": "NCT03994796", "Note": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "CDK4", "Alteration": "amplification", "Title": "A Study Evaluating the Activity of Anti_cancer Treatments Targeting Tumor Molecular Alterations/Characteristics in Advanced / Metastatic Tumors.", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "CDK6, CDK4, MDM2, MET, ROS1, RET, VEGFRs", "Locations": "Nice (France), Lyon (France), Marseille (France), Toulouse (France), Bordeaux (France)", "NCTID": "NCT04116541", "Note": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "CDK4", "Alteration": "amplification", "Title": "NCT Neuro Master Match _ N\u00b2M\u00b2 (NOA_20)", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1/2", "Target": "ALK, RET, CDK4, CDK6, mTOR, MDM2, PD_L1, SMO", "Locations": "Berlin (Germany), Dresden (Germany), Regensburg (Germany), Bochum (Germany), Frankfurt am Main (Germany), Essen (Germany), Mainz (Germany), Heidelberg (Germany), Cologne (Germany), Mannheim (Germany)", "NCTID": "NCT03158389", "Note": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "CDK4", "Alteration": "amplification", "Title": "A Study of Abemaciclib in Recurrent Glioblastoma", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "CDK4, CDK6", "Locations": "Utah, California, Massachusetts", "NCTID": "NCT02981940", "Note": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "EGFR", "Alteration": "exon 20 insertion (N771_P772insNN)", "Title": "A Study of CC_95251, a Monoclonal Antibody Directed Against SIRP\u03b1, in Subjects With Advanced Solid and Hematologic Cancers", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "CD20, EGFR, SIRP_alpha", "Locations": "Heidelberg (Australia), Melbourne (Australia), Edmonton (Canada), Oregon, California, Arizona, Toronto (Canada), Oklahoma, Missouri, Pennsylvania", "NCTID": "NCT03783403", "Note": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.
