Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 alterations have been reported in 29_80% of ovarian tumors, with a higher incidence in high_grade pelvic (primary ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal) serous carcinoma, with incidence of 91_97% (Ahmed et al., 2010; 20229506, Wojnarowicz et al., 2012; 23029043, Kuhn et al., 2012; 21990067, Karst and Drapkin, 2010; 19746182, Gadducci et al., 2012; 22304686, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011; 21720365, Rechsteiner et al., 2013; 23965232, Okamoto et al., 1991; 1680546). TP53 alterations have also been reported in serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STICs) of the Fallopian tube, which are suggested to be precursor lesions of tubo_ovarian high grade serous carcinomas (MacDaniel et al., 2015; 26181193, Kindelberger et al., 2007; 17255760, Meserve et al., 2017; 28106106, Kurman and Shih, 2011; 21683865). Aberrant p53 expression has been associated with higher ovarian serous carcinoma grade (89_90% of high_grade vs. 6.6_9% of low_grade vs. 0% of benign) (Altman et al., 2013; 23558569, Giurgea et al., 2012; 23303020, Rajesh et al., 2007; 17883046). In one study, p53 expression was not prognostic in regard to outcome in patients with peritoneum serous carcinoma (Lee et al., 2013; 24071870). TP53 mutations have been reported to be more frequent in advanced stage (63%, 55/87) and higher grade (65%, 42/64) than earlier stage (31%, 14/45) and lower grade (41%, 7/17) ovarian carcinomas (Rechsteiner et al., 2013; 23965232). Meta_analysis has suggested that TP53 expression was associated with poorer survival in ovarian epithelial cancers, although the effect was modest and considerable variability was observed between studies (de Graeff et al., 2009; 19513073). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "TP53 loss of function alterations may predict sensitivity to WEE1 inhibitors.

Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TSC1 function or expression (Miloloza et al., 2000; 10915759, Hoogeveen_Westerveld et al., 2010; 20547222, Hodges et al., 2001; 11741833). TSC1 deletion or mutation has been reported in 1% and 0.6% of ovarian serous carcinomas, respectively (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2011; 21720365). Loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 9q, a region that includes TSC1 and TSC2, has been reported in 54_79% of ovarian carcinoma samples, and associated with late stage and higher grade tumors (Knowles et al., 2003; 12773163, Cliby et al., 1993; 8485726, Devlin et al., 1996; 8595153, Schultz et al., 1995; 7743516). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of TSC1 alterations in ovarian carcinoma are limited (PubMed, Sep 2022). Loss or inactivation of TSC1 can activate mTOR signaling (Tee et al., 2003; 12906785, Mallela et al., 2021; 33575875); however, response rates for patients with TSC1_mutated solid tumors treated with MTOR inhibitors such as everolimus and temsirolimus have been low (Adib et al., 2021; 33727259, Nassar et al., 2020; 31653662, Voss et al., 2019; 30327302). In the prospective NCI_MATCH study, the ORR for patients with various TSC1_mutated solid tumors treated with everolimus was 7.7% (1/13); the single response was reported for a patient with urothelial cancer (Adib et al., 2021; 33727259). In TSC1_mutated renal cell carcinoma (RCC), although responses to MTOR inhibitors have been described in multiple case series and reports (Ali et al., 2015; 25796537, Lim et al., 2016; 26859683, Kwiatkowski et al., 2016; 26831717, Hamieh et al., 2018; 30256787, Roldan_Romero et al., 2020; 31335987), retrospective analysis of a broader cohort showed no responses in TSC1_mutated RCC (0/7) (Nassar et al., 2020; 31653662). Retrospective analyses of the RECORD_3, GRANITE_1, and EVOLVE_1 studies of everolimus to treat patients with RCC, gastric cancer, or hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively, showed no significant association between alterations in MTOR, TSC1, or TSC2 and median PFS (Voss et al., 2019; 30327302). PRs have been reported for patients with TSC1_altered perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (Wagner et al., 2021; 34637337, Kopparthy and Murphy, 2021; 34123648) and epithelial ovarian carcinoma (Dickson et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3111) treated with nab_sirolimus. Inactivating germline mutations in TSC1 are associated with the autosomal dominant disorder tuberous sclerosis complex, which results in the development of hamartomas in multiple organ systems and an increased risk of developing renal cell carcinoma (Gomez, 1991; 2039135, van Slegtenhorst et al., 1997; 9242607). TSC1 mutations account for approximately 10 to 30% of reported sporadic cases (Crino et al., 2006; 17005952). Prevalence for this disorder in the general population is estimated to be 1/6,000 from birth and 1/12,000 to 1/14,000 in children under 10 years of age (Curatolo et al., 2008; 18722871).

Outside of malignant PEComa, PRs were reported for individual patients with TSC2_altered endometrial stromal sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, high_grade sarcoma, or lymphangioleiomyomatosis and TSC1_altered epithelial ovarian cancer treated with nab_sirolimus; durable clinical benefit was also reported for a patient with TSC1_altered angiosarcoma treated with nab_sirolimus (Dickson et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 3111). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT03239015", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04337463", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04803318", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05125523", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02693535", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03297606", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04185831", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT01582191", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03203525", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Homologous Recombination status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "HRD Not Detected", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "HRD Not Detected"}}, "Interpretation": null, "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Loss of Heterozygosity score", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "LOH_Low", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "LOH_Low"}}, "Interpretation": "The loss of heterozygosity (LOH) score is a profile of the percentage of the tumor genome that is under focal loss of one allele (Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594); focal LOH events accumulate as genomic \"scars\" as a result of incorrect DNA double_strand break repair when the homologous recombination pathway is deficient (HRD) (Abkevich et al., 2012; 23047548, Wang et al., 2012; 22912389, Watkins et al., 2014; 25093514, Vanderstichele et al., 2017; 28950147). HRD and consequent genomic LOH occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one or more of the homologous recombination pathway proteins, including BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51C, ATM, PALB2, and BRIP1 (Vanderstichele et al., 2017; 28950147, Watkins et al., 2014; 25093514, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2011; 21720365, Venkitaraman, 2003; 12736286). This sample harbors a genomic LOH score below levels that have been associated with improved rates of clinical benefit from treatment with the PARP inhibitor rucaparib in patients with platinum_sensitive, BRCA1/2 wild_type ovarian, peritoneal, or Fallopian tube carcinoma (Coleman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5540, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). However, patients with lower genomic LOH have also responded to rucaparib, and this type of LOH score does not preclude benefit from PARP inhibitors (Coleman et al., 2017; 28916367, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). In a study of more than 4,000 ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer samples, genomic LOH score \u2265 16% was identified in 24.2% of BRCA1/2 wild_type cases, deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation was identified in an additional 17.2% of cases, and the remaining 58.7% of cases had LOH score < 16% and were BRCA1/2 wild_type (Elvin et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 5512). Among the histological subtypes, LOH score \u2265 16% or BRCA1/2 mutation was reported in 42.4% of serous carcinomas, 37.6% of endometrioid carcinomas, 23.5% of carcinosarcomas, 20.6% of neuroendocrine carcinomas, 13.6% of clear cell carcinomas, and 8.1% of mucinous carcinomas; in BRCA1/2 wild_type samples, the median LOH score was significantly higher in serous as compared with non_serous cases (Elvin et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 5512). In ovarian carcinoma, the median LOH score is significantly higher for BRCA1/2_mutated cases than BRCA1/2 wild_type cases (22.2% vs. 9.8%) (Elvin et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 5512), and mutation or methylation of BRCA1, BRCA2, or RAD51C has been reported to be enriched in cases with increased genomic LOH (Wang et al., 2012; 22912389, Abkevich et al., 2012; 23047548). One study reported no association between LOH and either tumor stage or grade in ovarian serous carcinoma (Marquard et al., 2015; 26015868). In patients with high_grade serous ovarian carcinoma, the frequency of LOH has been reported to increase significantly with age (Pedersen et al., 2013; 23716468). On the basis of emerging clinical data in ovarian cancer, elevated genomic LOH may be associated with greater sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Coleman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5540, Coleman et al., 2017; 28916367, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). In platinum_sensitive, BRCA1/2 wild_type ovarian, peritoneal, or Fallopian tube carcinoma, rucaparib elicited significantly longer median PFS (7.2 vs. 5.0 months, HR=0.51) and improved ORR (33.3% vs. 9.6%, p=0.0003) for patients with LOH score \u2265 16% (Coleman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5540, Swisher et al., 2016; 27908594). In the maintenance setting in platinum_sensitive, BRCA1/2 wild_type patients, rucaparib was superior to placebo in both the LOH score \u2265 16% (median PFS, 9.7 vs. 5.4 months; HR=0.44) and LOH score < 16% (median PFS, 6.7 vs. 5.4 months; HR=0.58) cohorts (Coleman et al., 2017; 28916367). Similar results have been reported for maintenance treatment with niraparib in ovarian cancer (Mirza et al., 2016; 27717299) when using a different measure of HRD that includes genomic LOH (Telli et al., 2016; 26957554, Timms et al., 2014; 25475740). Increased LOH has also been associated with improved sensitivity to platinum_containing chemotherapy regimens in patients with ovarian or breast cancer (Wang et al., 2012; 22912389, Telli et al., 2015; 25847929, Isakoff et al., 2015; 25847936).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI_high (MSI_H) has been reported in 1.6_19.7% of ovarian cancer samples (Segev et al., 2015; 26775351, Plisiecka_Ha\u0142asa et al., 2008; 18507046), including 3.8% (1/26) of ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinomas (Huang et al., 2015; 25195947), and 10.0% (3/30) of ovarian clear cell carcinomas (CCOCs) (Strickland et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5514). No association of MSI_H with stage or survival was found in patients with ovarian cancer (Segev et al., 2015; 26775351, Aysal et al., 2012; 22189970). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "02", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "02"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB level associated with lower rates of clinical benefit from treatment with PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors compared with patients with tumors harboring higher TMB levels, based on several studies in multiple solid tumor types (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947). Ovarian carcinomas, including peritoneal and Fallopian tube carcinomas, harbor a median TMB of 2.7_3.6 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb) depending upon subtype, and up to 2.1% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). In a study of high grade serous ovarian cancer, homologous recombination (HR)_deficient tumors, which comprised ~50% of all samples, harbored a higher neoantigen load compared to HR_proficient tumors; higher neoantigen load was associated with longer OS but not disease free survival (Strickland et al., 2016; 26871470). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In multiple pan_tumor studies, increased tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) was associated with sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947, Ott et al., 2019; 30557521, Cristescu et al., 2022; 35101941, Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). In the KEYNOTE 158 trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with solid tumors, significant improvement in ORR was observed for patients with TMB \u226510 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) compared with those with TMB <10 Muts/Mb in a large cohort that included multiple tumor types (Marabelle et al., 2020; 32919526); similar findings were observed in the KEYNOTE 028 and 012 trials (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915). At the same TMB cutpoint, retrospective analysis of patients with solid tumors treated with any checkpoint inhibitor identified that tissue TMB scores \u2265 10 Muts/Mb were associated with prolonged time to treatment failure compared with scores <10 muts/Mb (HR=0.68) (Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716). For patients with solid tumors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the CheckMate 848 trial, improved responses were observed in patients with a tissue TMB \u2265 10 Muts/Mb independent of blood TMB at any cutpoint in matched samples (Schenker at al., 2022; AACR Abstract 7845). However, support for higher TMB thresholds and efficacy was observed in the prospective Phase 2 MyPathway trial of atezolizumab for patients with pan_solid tumors, where improved ORR and DCR was seen in patients with TMB \u2265 16 Muts/Mb than those with TMB \u2265 10 and <16 Muts/Mb (Friedman et al., 2022; 34876409). Similarly, analyses across several solid tumor types reported that patients with higher TMB (defined as \u226516_20 Muts/Mb) achieved greater clinical benefit from PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting monotherapy compared with patients with higher TMB treated with chemotherapy (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000) or those with lower TMB treated with PD_1 or PD_L1_targeting agents (Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "TP53", "Alteration": "G244D", "Title": "A Study of ZN_c3 in Patients With Platinum_Resistant Ovarian Cancer", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "WEE1", "Locations": "Busan (Korea, Republic of), Seoul (Korea, Republic of), Nedlands (Australia), Sunshine Coast (Australia), South Brisbane (Australia), Melbourne (Australia), Panagyurishte (Bulgaria), Belgrade (Serbia), Tuzla (Bosnia and Herzegovina), Sarajevo (Bosnia and Herzegovina)", "NCTID": "NCT04516447", "Note": "TP53 loss of function alterations may predict sensitivity to WEE1 inhibitors.
