TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a bTMB level that may be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9016). Average bTMB levels in solid tumors other than NSCLC have not been evaluated (PubMed, Mar 2022). For patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) treated with PD_L1/PD_1 inhibitors, a Kaplan_Meier analysis showed a significant association for patients with high tumor mutational burden (TMB) with longer time to treatment failure (9.9 vs. 4.4 months) (Goodman et al., 2019; 31003990). In the majority of cutaneous SCC cases, high mutational burden has been attributed to UV exposure rather than defective DNA mismatch repair or polymerase activity (South et al., 2014; 24662767, Pickering et al., 2014; 25303977), although one study reported a small number of cutaneous SCC cases (4/39) harboring a mutation signature similar to that of human papillomavirus_positive head and neck SCC (Pickering et al., 2014; 25303977). In patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TMB is similar between cases with squamous and non_squamous histology (Spigel et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9017), and increased TMB is associated with higher tumor grade and poor prognosis (Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843), as well as with a decreased frequency of known driver mutations in EGFR, ALK, ROS1, or MET (1% of high_TMB samples each) but not BRAF (10%) or KRAS (9.4%) (Spigel et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9017). Although some studies have reported a lack of association between smoking and increased TMB in NSCLC (Schwartz et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 8533, Xiao et al., 2016; 27009843, Shim et al., 2015; 26200269), several other large studies did find a strong prognostic association (Govindan et al., 2012; 22980976, Ding et al., 2008; 18948947, Imielinski et al., 2012; 22980975, Kim et al., 2014; 24323028). For patients with gastric cancer, increased TMB is reported to be associated with prolonged OS (Cai et al., 2020; 32141230, Zhao et al., 2021; 33510848, Wei et al., 2021; 33613701). One study observed that the OS and disease_free survival (DFS) benefits of postoperative chemotherapy were more pronounced in patients with TMB_low gastric cancer (stage Ib/II) compared to those with TMB_high; however, patients with stage III gastric cancer benefitted regardless of TMB level (Wang et al., 2021; 33687617). In esophageal cancer, patients with TMB_high who had not received radiotherapy had significantly reduced OS (p=0.038) compared to those with TMB_low (Yuan et al., 2019; 32165590). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB) may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Wang et al., 2019; 30816954, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716), anti_PD_1 (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022, Aggarwal et al., 2020; 32102950, Peters et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT074, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P, Sturgill et al., 2022; 35274716), anti_PD_1/CTLA4 therapies (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022, Saori et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract 80P), anti_PD_L1/CTLA4 therapies (Chen et al., 2020; 32379280, Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61, Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511, Rizvi et al., 2020; 32271377, Si et al., 2021; 33355200, Leighl et al., 2022; 34800700). A Phase 2 multi_solid_tumor trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Schenker et al., 2022; AACR Abstract CT022). In non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), multiple clinical trials have shown patients with higher bTMB derive clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors following single_agent or combination treatments with either CTLA4 inhibitors or chemotherapy, with reported high bTMB cutpoints ranging from 6 Muts/Mb_16 Muts/Mb (Gandara et al., 2018; 30082870, Socinski et al., 2019 ESMO Abstract LBA83, Aggarwal et al. 2020; 32102950, Rizvi et al., 2020; 32271377, Si et al., 2021; 33355200, Leighl et al., 2022; 34800700). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a Phase 3 trial showed that bTMB \u226516 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u22658 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved survival from treatment with a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Li et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 6511). In colorectal cancer (CRC), a Phase 2 study showed that bTMB TMB \u226528 Muts/Mb (approximate equivalency \u226514 Muts/Mb as measured by this assay) was associated with improved OS from a PD_L1 inhibitor alone or in combination with a CTLA_4 inhibitor (Loree et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 61, Chen et al., 2020; 32379280). CCND1 amplification may predict worse outcomes on immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti_PD_1/PD_L1/CTLA_4) in solid tumors on the basis of 2 meta_analyses (Chen et al., 2020; 32903763, Litchfield et al., 2021; 33508232); in these studies, CCND1 amplification was associated with significantly decreased response rate (Litchfield et al., 2021; 33508232) and OS (HR=1.6_2.0)(Chen et al., 2020; 32903763, Litchfield et al., 2021; 33508232) across various tumor types and significantly shorter OS specifically in urothelial carcinoma (HR=2.2_3.6), melanoma (HR=1.6_2.5), and solid tumors harboring elevated TMB (HR=2.8)(Chen et al., 2020; 32903763, Litchfield et al., 2021; 33508232).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Increased tumor mutational burden may predict response to anti_PD_1 (alone or in combination with anti_CTLA_4) or anti_PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04237649", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04550260", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04543617", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04210115", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04949256", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05166577", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04785820", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05007106", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03674567", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04152018", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "CCND1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "CCND1 encodes cyclin D1, a binding partner of the kinases CDK4 and CDK6, that regulates RB activity and cell cycle progression. Amplification of CCND1 has been positively correlated with cyclin D1 overexpression (Elsheikh et al., 2008; 17653856) and may lead to excessive proliferation (Fu et al., 2004; 15331580, Takahashi_Yanaga and Sasaguri, 2008; 18023328). Among gastroesophageal carcinomas, CCND1 amplification is most frequent in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC; 22_70%)(Takeshita et al., 2010; 20389301, Jin et al., 2004; 14697637, Manoel_Caetano et al., 2004; 15104278, Sunpaweravong et al., 2005; 15672286, Roncalli et al., 1998; 9759649, FMI_Wang et al., 2015; 26336083, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2017; 28052061) and less frequent in esophageal adenocarcinomas (7_15%)(Miller et al., 2003; 14581353, Morgan et al., 1999; 10419705, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2017; 28052061) and gastric adenocarcinomas (6%)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317). Expression of cyclin D1 has also been detected in 42_58% of ESCC samples (Sunpaweravong et al., 2005; 15672286, Boone et al., 2009; 19302210). CCND1 amplification and cyclin D1 overexpression have been correlated with tumor recurrence, reduced survival, and poor prognosis in patients with ESCC (Br\u00fccher et al., 2009; 18704459, G\u00fcner et al., 2003; 12478659, Takeshita et al., 2010; 20389301, Roncalli et al., 1998; 9759649). Amplification or overexpression of CCND1 may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib (Juric et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 568, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Tolaney et al., 2016; SABCS P4_22_12, Morschhauser et al., 2020; 32381571, Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27217383, Leonard et al., 2012; 22383795), although as monotherapy these agents have shown limited activity in tumor types other than breast cancer (Dickler et al., 2017; 28533223, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27217383). In refractory advanced solid tumors with CCND1 (n=39) or CCND3 (n=1) amplification and retinoblastoma protein expression, palbociclib resulted in SD for 39% (14/36) of patients and a median PFS of 1.8 months in the NCI_MATCH trial (Clark et al., 2019; AACR Abstract LB_010/2); 4 patients (13%, 4/36 overall) with squamous cell carcinomas (lung, esophageal, or laryngeal) or adenoid cystic carcinoma experienced prolonged SD in this study (Clark et al., 2019; AACR Abstract LB_010/2). Among 9 patients with CCND1_amplified advanced solid tumors, 1 patient with bladder cancer responded to ribociclib in a Phase 2 trial (Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528). CCND1 amplification may predict worse outcomes on immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti_PD_1/PD_L1/CTLA_4) in solid tumors on the basis of 2 meta_analyses (Chen et al., 2020; 32903763, Litchfield et al., 2021; 33508232); in these studies, CCND1 amplification was associated with significantly decreased response rate (Litchfield et al., 2021; 33508232) and OS (HR=1.6_2.0)(Chen et al., 2020; 32903763, Litchfield et al., 2021; 33508232) across various tumor types and significantly shorter OS specifically in urothelial carcinoma (HR=2.2_3.6), melanoma (HR=1.6_2.5), and solid tumors harboring elevated TMB (HR=2.8)(Chen et al., 2020; 32903763, Litchfield et al., 2021; 33508232). In addition, overexpression of cyclin D1 has been associated with a poor response to chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy in patients with ESCC (Sarbia et al., 1999; 9988238, Samejima et al., 2000; 10697609).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "CCND1 amplification or overexpression may activate CDK4/6 and may predict sensitivity to single_agent CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04000529", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04282031", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03297606", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05252416", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02896335", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "KRAS", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "KRAS encodes a member of the RAS family of small GTPases. Activating mutations in RAS genes can cause uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor formation (Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Kahn et al., 1987; 3310850). In numerous cancer type_specific studies as well as a large_scale pan_cancer analysis, KRAS amplification was shown to correlate with increased expression (McIntyre et al., 2005; 16354586, Mita et al., 2009; 19545448, Birkeland et al., 2012; 23099803, Chen et al., 2014; 24874471). Additionally, KRAS amplification correlated with sensitivity of cancer cell lines to KRAS knockdown, suggesting that amplified KRAS is an oncogenic driver (Chen et al., 2014; 24874471). KRAS amplification has been reported in up to 27% of esophageal adenocarcinomas examined, compared with 17% of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (Miller et al., 2003; 14581353, Hjortland et al., 2011; 22014070, Bandla et al., 2012; 22450065, Deng et al., 2012; 22315472). KRAS alterations, including mutations (Warneke et al., 2013; 23846438) and amplification (Wong et al., 2018; 29808010, Qian et al., 2014; 24935174, Deng et al., 2012; 22315472, Henderson et al., 2016; DOI: 10.1200/jco.2016.34.4_suppl.74) are associated with worse prognosis in patients with gastroesophageal cancer. One study reported that KRAS alteration did not significantly associate with OS in a cohort of patients with gastric, esophageal, or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (Kato et al., 2018; 30348637). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of KRAS alterations in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma are limited (PubMed, Sep 2022). Preclinical evidence suggests that KRAS activation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, such as trametinib, binimetinib, cobimetinib, and selumetinib (Nakano et al., 1984; 6320174, Pylayeva_Gupta et al., 2011; 21993244, Yamaguchi et al., 2011; 21523318, Watanabe et al., 2013; 23438367, Gilmartin et al., 2011; 21245089, Yeh et al., 2009; 19372556). Clinical evidence that KRAS amplification in the absence of a concurrent KRAS activating mutation is sensitive to MEK inhibitors is limited. A Phase 2 study of selumetinib plus docetaxel in patients with gastric cancer reported 1 of 2 patients with KRAS amplification experienced a PR (Lee et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 4061). A patient with cervical cancer harboring both KRAS and PIK3CA amplification treated with the combination of trametinib and the AKT inhibitor GSK2141795 achieved a SD (Lui et al., 2019; 31118140).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "KRAS activating mutations or amplification may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of MAPK pathway components, including MEK inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04985604", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04803318", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03284502", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04551521", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03905148", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05159245", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04720976", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04965818", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05340621", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "BAP1", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "splice site 1117_6_1143del33", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "19.14", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "splice site 1117_6_1143del33"}}, "Interpretation": "BAP1 (BRCA1 associated protein_1) encodes a ubiquitin hydrolase, a protein involved in regulating the availability of target proteins for the ubiquitin_proteasome protein degradation pathway; BAP1 is located on chromosome 3p21.3, in a region of frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in breast and lung cancer, and has been postulated to be a tumor suppressor (Jensen et al., 1998; 9528852, Ventii et al., 2008; 18757409). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt BAP1 function or expression (Ventii et al., 2008; 18757409, Chan_On et al., 2013; 24185513, Abdel_Rahman et al., 2011; 21941004, Testa et al., 2011; 21874000, Wiesner et al., 2011; 21874003, Farley et al., 2013; 23709298, Aoude et al., 2013; 23977234, Peng et al., 2018; 29284740, Nishikawa et al., 2009; 19117993, Zhang et al., 2018; 30202049). In esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, BAP1 mutation has been reported in 2% of cases (Zhang et al., 2015; 25839328) and one study reported deletion of the BAP1 locus in 52% (14/27) cases (Mori et al., 2015; 26081045). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of BAP1 alteration in esophageal carcinomas are limited (PubMed, Aug 2022). Clinical (Zauderer et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 8515) and preclinical (LaFave et al., 2015; 26437366) evidence in the context of mesothelioma suggests that tumors with BAP1 inactivation may be sensitive to EZH2 inhibitors such as tazemetostat. Preclinical studies suggest that BAP1 is involved in the DNA damage response (Yu et al., 2014; 24347639, Ismail et al., 2014; 24894717, Pe\u00f1a_Llopis et al., 2012; 22683710, Nishi et al., 2014; 25194926), and BAP1 inactivation might be associated with sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Pe\u00f1a_Llopis et al., 2012; 22683710, Ismail et al., 2014; 24894717, Zhang et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract e23192). One preclinical study suggests that HDAC inhibitors may be beneficial in BAP1_mutated uveal melanoma; however, it is unclear if these inhibitors are effective in other BAP1_mutated cancers (Landreville et al., 2012; 22038994). BAP1 germline inactivating alterations, including mutations and deletions, are associated with BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome (BAP1_TPDS), an autosomal_dominant syndrome characterized by early onset of benign melanocytic skin tumors (Walpole et al., 2018; 30517737, Testa et al., 2011; 21874000, 23550303, Boru et al., 2019; 30883995). An estimated 2% of patients with BAP1_inactivated melanocytic tumors display germline BAP1 mutations (Garfield et al., 2018; 29753057). Later in life, patients have an increased risk of cancers such as uveal melanoma, mesothelioma, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and meningioma (Abdel_Rahman et al., 2011; 21941004, Testa et al., 2011; 21874000, Wiesner et al., 2011; 21874003, Farley et al., 2013; 23709298, Aoude et al., 2013; 23977234, Shankar et al., 2017; 28170043). In small studies, the prevalence of pathogenic germline BAP1 mutation has been reported as 22% in familial uveal melanoma and 4.4% in mesothelioma (Rai et al., 2017; 27718540, Zauderer et al., 2019; 31323388). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of BAP1 is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "CBL", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "splice site 1096_12_1111del28", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "1.41", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "splice site 1096_12_1111del28"}}, "Interpretation": "CBL encodes an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase that is involved in cell signaling and ubiquitination, targeting proteins such as EGFR, FGFR1, FGFR2, PDGFR_alpha, PDGFR_beta, FLT3, and SRC for degradation by the proteasome (Bacher et al., 2010; 20195608, Miyake et al., 1999; 10347229, Polzer et al., 2012; 23127761, Levkowitz et al., 1998; 9851973, Bunda et al., 2013; 23400592). CBL alterations that result in loss or disruption of the tyrosine kinase binding domain, RING finger domain, and/or tail domain, as observed here, are predicted to be inactivating and to promote tumorigenesis (Andonoiou et al., 1994; 7925293, Aranaz et al., 2012; 22315494, Fernandes et al., 2010; 20622007, Grand et al., 2009; 19387008, Javadi et al., 2013; 23696637, Kassenbrock et al., 2004; 15117950, Levkowitz et al., 1999; 10635327, Loh et al., 2009; 19571318, Martinelli et al., 2010; 20619386, Saito et al., 2012; 22591685, Sanada et al., 2009; 19620960, Score et al., 2012; 22053108, Shiba et al., 2011; 21494262, Standaert et al., 2004; 15581361, Tan et al., 2010; 20126411, Thien et al., 2001; 11239464, Visser and Lill, 2005; 16246327, Li et al., 2016; 26676746). CBL mutations have been reported in 3.5% of esophagogastric carcinomas, 3.2% of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, 2.3% of esophagogastric, and in 0.9% of stomach adenocarcinomas (cBioPortal, Apr 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). CBL protein expression was detected in 67% (82/122), and diffuse expression in 29% (25/122), of gastric carcinoma samples; the latter was associated with increased depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, and tumor stage (Ito et al., 2004; 14991403). CBL inactivation may lead to the hyperactivation of various receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including MET (Mancini et al., 2002; 11847211), PDGFRA (Miyake et al., 1998; 9653117), KIT (Masson et al., 2006; 16780420), VEGFR2 (Singh et al., 2007; 17372230), and the TAM (TYRO3, AXL, MER) RTKs (Paolino et al., 2014; 24553136). These RTKs are targets of the multikinase inhibitor sitravatinib (Patwardhan et al., 2016; 26675259), which has shown activity in CBL_mutated advanced solid tumors (Bazhenova et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 408O). Among 8 patients with CBL inactivating alterations in a Phase 1b trial, sitravatinib produced 2 PRs (25% ORR), with 1 NSCLC and 1 melanoma responding for over 4 months, and 4 SD outcomes, with 3 prolonged SDs seen in a patient with NSCLC, a patient with esophageal cancer, and a patient with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (Bazhenova et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 408O). CBL has been shown to downregulate EGFR (Shtiegman et al., 2007; 17486068, Padr\u00f3n et al., 2007; 17699773, Hosaka et al., 2007; 17695511, Han et al., 2006; 16969069, Yang et al., 2006; 16849543) and FLT3 (Sargin et al., 2007; 17446348, Oshikawa et al., 2011; 21768087, Reindl et al., 2009; 19276253). Preclinical models of myeloid malignancies have demonstrated that CBL inactivation confers sensitivity to the FLT3_targeting therapies sunitinib (Sargin et al., 2007; 17446348), midostaurin (Reindl et al., 2009; 19276253), and quizartinib (Taylor et al., 2012; 22990016), as well as to dasatinib (Makishima et al., 2012; 22246246), although clinical evidence for this approach in solid tumors is lacking.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "DNMT3A", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "E442*, M439fs*212", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": [{"dnaFraction": "1.92", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "E442*"}, {"dnaFraction": "1.82", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "M439fs*212"}]}, "Interpretation": "The DNMT3A gene encodes the protein DNA methyltransferase 3A, an enzyme that is involved in the methylation of newly synthesized DNA, a function critical for gene regulation (Trowbridge and Orkin, 2012; 22200773, Ch\u00e9din, 2011; 21507354). The role of DNMT3A in cancer is uncertain, as some reports describe increased expression and contribution to tumor growth, whereas others propose a role for DNMT3A as a tumor suppressor (Yang et al., 2011; 21887466, Vallb\u00f6hmer et al., 2006; 16870044, Daskalos et al., 2011; 21351083, Fabbri et al., 2007; 17890317, Gao et al., 2011; 22011581, Kim et al., 2013; 23031157). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt DNMT3A function or expression (Chen et al., 2005; 15861382, Guo et al., 2015; 25383530, Sandoval et al., 2019; 30705090, Zhang et al., 2018; 29414941). DNMT3A alterations have been reported at relatively low frequencies in solid tumors and are more prevalent in hematological malignancies (cBioPortal, Feb 2022)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). Published data investigating the prognostic implications of DNMT3A alterations in solid tumors are limited (PubMed, Feb 2022). There are no targeted therapies available to address genomic alterations in DNMT3A in solid tumors. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

FGF19 lies in a region of chromosome 11q13 that also contains FGF3, FGF4, and CCND1; this region is frequently amplified in a diverse range of malignancies (Katoh et al., 2002; 12429977). Correlation between FGF19 amplification and protein expression has been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)(Kan et al., 2013; 23788652), lung squamous cell carcinoma (Li et al., 2020; 32111983, Caruso et al., 2019; 31063779), and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)(Gao et al., 2019; 30518874), but was not observed in other cancers (Sawey et al., 2011; 21397858, Kanzaki et al., 2021; 33674622).

Studies suggest FGF19 expression may also be a poor prognostic indicator in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)(Gao et al., 2019; 30518874) and lung SCC (Li et al., 2020; 32111983). A Phase 1 study of the FGFR4 inhibitor fisogatinib (BLU_554) for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) reported a 17% ORR (11/66, 1 CR, ongoing for >1.5 years) and 3.3_month PFS for FGF19 IHC\u2013positive patients; patients with negative or unknown FGF19 IHC scores experienced poorer outcomes (0% ORR, 2.3_month PFS)(Kim et al., 2019; 31575541). A Phase 1/2 study evaluating another FGFR4 inhibitor, FGF401, demonstrated an ORR of 7.5% (4/53) and SD rate of 53% (28/53) for patients with HCC (Chan et al., 2017; AACR Abstract CT106). A Phase 1 study of the FGFR4 inhibitor H3B_6527 reported a 17% ORR (OS of 10.3 months, 46% clinical benefit rate) among patients with HCC; enrollment of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) was suspended due to efficacy (Macarulla et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4090). A retrospective analysis reported that 50% (2/4) of patients with HCC harboring FGF19 amplification experienced a CR to sorafenib (Kaibori et al., 2016; 27384874), though another retrospective study found patients with higher pretreatment serum levels of FGF19 experienced reduced benefit from sorafenib compared with those with lower serum FGF19 (PFS of 86 vs. 139 days, OS of 353 vs. 494 days); no difference was observed for lenvatinib (Kanzaki et al., 2021; 33674622). A patient with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with 11q13 (FGF3, FGF4, FGF19) and 12p13 (FGF6 and FGF23) amplification experienced a CR lasting 9 months from a pan_FGFR inhibitor (Dumbrava et al., 2018; 31123723).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "FGF3", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "FGF3 encodes fibroblast growth factor 3, a growth factor that plays a central role in development of the inner ear.

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942).

Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 mutations have been observed in 61_93% of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma samples (cBio_Song et al., 2014; 24670651, cBio_Lin et al., 2014; 24686850, Sawada et al., 2016; 26873401). While some studies have reported no association between TP53 mutation status and prognosis in patients with esophageal carcinoma or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (Sengpiel et al., 2009; 19160092, P\u00fchringer_Oppermann et al., 2006; 16538517) others have associated TP53 mutation and elevated p53 expression with poor prognosis for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Han et al., 2007; 17760650, Yamasaki et al., 2010; 19941080) or stomach cancer (Liu et al., 2012; 23285001, Wiksten et al., 2008; 18751407, Migliavacca et al., 2004; 15254976). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}]}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Fraction", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "Elevated Tumor Fraction"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor fraction provides an estimate of the percentage of ctDNA present in a cell_free DNA (cfDNA) sample. The tumor fraction estimate for this sample is based on the observed level of aneuploid instability. The tumor fraction algorithm utilized for FoundationOne Liquid CDx uses the allele frequencies of approximately 1,000 single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites across the genome. Unlike the maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) method of estimating ctDNA content (Li et al., 2019; 31602320), the tumor fraction metric does not take into account the allele frequency of individual variants but rather produces a more holistic estimate of ctDNA content using data from across the genome. The amount of ctDNA detected may correlate with disease burden and response to therapy (Zhang et al., 2020; 32757294, Butler et al., 2019; 30833418). Detectible ctDNA levels have been reported in a variety of tumor types, with higher tumor fraction levels reported for patients with metastatic (Stage 4) tumors compared with patients with localized disease (Stages 1 to 3) (Bettegowda et al., 2014; 24553385). Elevated tumor fraction levels have been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in a variety of cancer types, including pancreatic cancer (Lapin et al., 2018; 30400802), Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma (Shulman et al., 2018; 30131550), prostate cancer (Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 5039), breast cancer (Stover et al., 2018; 29298117), leiomyosarcoma (Hemming et al., 2019; 30793095), esophageal cancer (Egyud et al., 2019; 31059681), colorectal cancer (Fan et al., 2017; 28187169), and gastrointestinal cancer (Vu et al., 2020; DOI: 10.1200/PO.19.00204). Specimens with elevated tumor fraction have high circulating_tumor DNA (ctDNA) content, and thus high sensitivity for identifying genomic alterations. Such specimens are at low risk of false negative results. Tumor fraction levels currently have limited implications for diagnosis, surveillance, or therapy and should not be overinterpreted or compared from one blood draw to another. There are currently no targeted approaches to address specific tumor fraction levels. In the research setting, changes in tumor fraction estimates have been associated with treatment duration and clinical response and may be a useful indicator for future cancer management (Bronkhorst et al., 2019; 30923679, Raja et al., 2018; 30093454, Hrebien et al., 2019; 30860573, Conteduca et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5039, Choudhury et al., 2018; 30385733, Goodall et al., 2017; 28450425, Goldberg et al., 2018; 29330207).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "Blood Tumor Mutational Burden", "Alteration": "13", "Title": "KAZ954 Alone and With PDR001, NZV930 and NIR178 in Advanced Solid Tumors", "StudyPhase": "PHASE null", "Target": "ADORA2A, CD73, PD_1", "Locations": "Taipei (Taiwan), Shatin, New Territories (Hong Kong), Sunto Gun (Japan), Singapore (Singapore), Milano (Italy), Barcelona (Spain), California, Illinois, Toronto (Canada), Missouri", "NCTID": "NCT04237649", "Note": "Increased tumor mutational burden may predict response to anti_PD_1 (alone or in combination with anti_CTLA_4) or anti_PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "Blood Tumor Mutational Burden", "Alteration": "13", "Title": "Study of Durvalumab Versus Placebo in Combination With Definitive Chemoradiation Therapy in Patient With ESCC", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 3", "Target": "PD_L1", "Locations": "Taipei (Taiwan), Tao_Yuan (Taiwan), Taichung (Taiwan), Changhua (Taiwan), Fuzhou (China), Tainan (Taiwan), Kaohsiung (Taiwan), Quanzhou (China), Jieyang (China), Hangzhou (China)", "NCTID": "NCT04550260", "Note": "Increased tumor mutational burden may predict response to anti_PD_1 (alone or in combination with anti_CTLA_4) or anti_PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "Blood Tumor Mutational Burden", "Alteration": "13", "Title": "A Study of Atezolizumab With or Without Tiragolumab in Participants With Unresectable Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Whose Cancers Have Not Progressed Following Definitive Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 3", "Target": "PD_L1, TIGIT", "Locations": "Zhongzheng Dist.
