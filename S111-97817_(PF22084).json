The consequences of alterations that may leave the GAP_related domain intact, such as seen here, are unclear; however, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. NF1 mutation has been observed in 5_6% of lower grade gliomas and 9_14% of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cases; homozygous deletion of NF1 was observed in 1% of lower grade gliomas and 2_3% of GBMs (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751, cBio_Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890). NF1 loss was significantly associated with decreased overall and disease_specific survival in patients with lower grade gliomas (II_III), but not in those with GBM (Vizcaino et al., 2015; 26190195).

Loss or inactivation of NF1 may also predict sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors, including everolimus and temsirolimus, based on limited clinical data (Lim et al., 2016; 26859683, Weiss et al., 2015; 25314964, Janku et al., 2014; 24931142) and strong preclinical data in models of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST)(Johannessen et al., 2008; 18164202, Johannessen et al., 2005; 15937108). A preclinical study suggests that combined mTOR and MEK inhibition is effective in a model of NF1_deficient MPNST (Malone et al., 2014; 24913553). Whereas frequent adverse events precluded a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for the combination of trametinib and everolimus in a Phase 1b trial for solid tumors (Tolcher et al., 2014; 25344362), a retrospective study for heavily pretreated patients with solid tumors reported tolerable regimens of the combination for 23/31 patients, with 16 patients treated >3 months and evaluable patients achieving a median PFS of 6.5 months (Patterson et al., 2018; AACR Abstract 3891). One or more of the NF1 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (ClinVar, Mar 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in NF1 cause the autosomal dominant disorder neurofibromatosis type 1, which is characterized in part by increased risk of developing various tumors, including sarcoma, glioma, breast carcinoma, and neuroendocrine and hematological neoplasms (Jett and Friedman, 2010; 20027112, Patil and Chamberlain, 2012; 22240541, Evans et al., 2012; 23036231).

A study of 5 patients with KIAA1549_BRAF_fusion_positive pilocytic astrocytoma reported 1 PR and 3 minor responses (Kondyli et al., 2018; 30097824) and, similarly, a patient with low_grade glioma harboring this fusion benefited from trametinib (Wagner et al., 2018; 29369501).

PIK3CA alterations that have been characterized as activating, such as observed here, are predicted to be oncogenic (Kang et al., 2005; 15647370, Ikenoue et al., 2005; 15930273, Gymnopoulos et al., 2007; 17376864, Horn et al., 2008; 18317450, Rudd et al., 2011; 21266528, Hon et al., 2012; 22120714, Burke et al., 2012; 22949682, Wu et al., 2009; 19915146, Dbouk et al., 2010; 2103068, Dan et al., 2010; 20530683, Oda et al., 2008; 18829572, Zhao and Vogt, 2008; 18794883, Lui et al., 2013; 23619167, Ross et al., 2013; 22430209, Riviere et al., 2012; 22729224, Shibata et al., 2009; 19394761, Droguluk et al., 2015; 26627007, Croessmann et al., 2018; 29284706, Ng et al., 2018; 29533785, Spangle et al., 2020; 32929011, Chen et al., 2018; 29636477, Jin et al., 2021; 34779417). PIK3CA mutations have been reported in 5_23% of high_grade gliomas (including glioblastomas, anaplastic astrocytomas, and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas) (El_Habr et al., 2010; 20569675, Gallia et al., 2006; 17050665, Broderick et al., 2004; 15289301, Derakhshandeh_Peykar et al., 2011; 22026810, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890). While another study did not observe PIK3CA mutations in low_grade astrocytomas or in anaplastic astrocytomas, it did report high ERK and AKT activity (El_Habr et al., 2010; 20569675). One study found that PIK3CA mutation in glioblastoma (GBM) was associated with shorter median PFS in both a discovery cohort (6.9 vs. 12.4 months, HR=2.89, p=0.01) and in the TCGA cohort (6.1 vs. 9 months, p=0.008), but was not consistently associated with median OS (Tanaka et al., 2019; 31036078). In a study of IDH_wildtype GBM, patients with alterations in PI3K class I genes (PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PIK3CG, and PIK3R2) had significantly longer OS (20.0 months altered vs. 16.9 months wildtype, HR=0.62, p=0.002) and PFS (11.0 months altered vs. 7.4 months wildtype, p=0.0043); patients with PIK3CA alterations experienced an improved OS but this association was not highly significant (20.0 months altered vs. 18.1 months wildtype, p=0.0407)(Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Clinical and preclinical data in various tumor types indicate that PIK3CA activating alterations may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting PI3K (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574, Juric et al., 2018; 29401002, Gallant et al., 2019; 30793038, Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23, Delestre et al., 2021; 34613809, Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Santin et al., 2020; 31934607, Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871), AKT (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Smyth et al., 2021; 33863913), or mTOR (Park et al., 2016; 27105424, Lim et al., 2016; 26859683, Hou et al., 2014; 25426553, Varnier et al., 2019; 31351267, Janku et al., 2014; 24440717, Moroney et al., 2012; 22927482, Basho et al., 2017; 27893038, Moroney et al., 2011; 21890452). The Phase 2 NCI_MATCH study of copanlisib for patients with refractory solid tumors harboring PIK3CA mutations with or without PTEN loss met its primary endpoint with an ORR of 16% (4/25 PRs); responses (PR or SD >6 months) were seen in patients with ameloblastoma, liposarcoma, and carcinomas of the endometrium, ovary, esophagus, lung, and prostate (Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871). However, the Phase 2 study of copanlisib for patients with endometrial carcinoma harboring PIK3CA hotspot mutations failed to report any objective responses (n=11)(Santin et al., 2020; 31934607). Two other studies of copanlisib for patients with genomically unselected tumors reported 1 CR and 2 PRs (1 unconfirmed) among 16 total patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors with or without PTEN alterations (Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108). In the Phase 2 MATCH trial for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors, 28% (18/65) of patients experienced PFS lasting at least 6 months after treatment with taselisib; however, no ORs were observed in this study (Krop et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 101). A separate Phase 1b study of taselisib in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors reported an ORR of 0% (n=12) and a DCR of 17% (2/12) (Pascual et al., 2021; 32958578). In a Phase 1 trial of the dual PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitor apitolisib, 79% (11/14) of patients with PIK3CA_mutated advanced solid tumors experienced disease control (3 PRs, 8 SDs) (Dolly et al., 2016; 26787751). The PI3K inhibitor alpelisib is approved as a single agent for the treatment of patients with PIK3CA_related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) (Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23), but has shown limited activity as monotherapy for PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors with a Phase 1a study reporting an ORR of 6.0% (8/134) and a DCR of 58% (78/134) (Juric et al., 2018; 2941002).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PIK3CA activating mutations may lead to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may therefore indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.

Histones form part of the nucleosome complex around which DNA is coiled in the cell. H3F3A mutations affecting different hotspot residues, such as G35 (commonly referred to as G34 in the literature) and K28 (commonly known as K27), form different subgroups based on methylation and gene expression differences, the region of the brain affected, and clinical parameters (Sturm et al., 2012; 23079654). Recurrent mutations in the histone tail of H3F3A, at sites involved in critical post_translational modifications, have been reported at high frequency in pediatric and young adult brain tumors, including diffuse midline gliomas (Solomon et al., 2016; 26517431), diffuse hemispheric glioma (Fontebasso et al., 2013; 23417712), glioblastomas (Pandit et al., 2016; ISPNO Abstract HG_58)(Schwartzentruber et al., 2012; 22286061, Venneti et al., 2014; 25200322), aggressive pediatric gliomas (Wu et al., 2012; 22286216), pilocytic astrocytomas (Hochart et al., 2015; 25909089), gangliogliomas (Joyon et al., 2016; 27219822), glial and glioneuronal tumors (Nguyen et al., 2015; 25389051), as well as in low_grade gliomas undergoing transformation and secondary high_grade gliomas (Mistry et al., 2015; 25667294). These mutations were commonly found concurrently with mutations in TP53 or in ATRX and DAXX, which form a complex required for H3.3 recruitment to DNA, and were mutually exclusive with IDH1 mutations, which indirectly affect methylation of critical H3.3 residues (Schwartzentruber et al., 2012; 22286061). H3F3A K28M (also known as K27M) is a poor prognostic marker in glioma (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022). H3F3A G35 mutations are associated with disease onset during adolescence, whereas K28 mutations affect younger children and predict poorer IOS (Sturm et al., 2012; 23079654, Venneti et al., 2014; 25200322). H3F3A K28M mutation has also been identified in 58% of adult midline gliomas, and is associated with shorter OS for patients with brainstem gliomas but not for patients with thalamic gliomas (Feng et al., 2015; 26297251). Mutations of H3F3A or H3F3B, the other gene encoding histone H3.3, have also been detected in giant cell tumor of bone and chondroblastoma, with low mutation frequencies in other tumors of cartilage and bone (Behjati et al., 2013; 24162739, Kervarrec et al., 2017; 28059095, Righi et al., 2017; 28899740). H3F3B K37M (commonly known as K36M) has been identified in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, specifically in tumors of the oral cavity (Papillon_Cavanagh et al., 2017; 28067913). Overexpression of H3F3A is associated with poor survival in lung adenocarcinomas, and is thought to promote cancer cell invasion (Park et al., 2016; 27694942). Prospective data from pooled clinical studies and preclinical evidence suggest that H3F3A K28M mutation predicts benefit from the investigational selective dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) antagonist ONC201 (Chi et al., 2018; SNO abstract ACTR_34, Gardner et al., 2018; SNO abstract PDCT_06, Arrillaga_Romany et al., 2017; 29108308, Prabhu et al., 2018; 30559168), which is supported by increased expression of the ONC201 target DRD2 in H3F3A K28M_mutant versus wild_type gliomas (Chi et al, 2017; SNO abstract EXTH_42, Prabhu et al., 2018; 30559168). Among adult patients with recurrent H3F3A K28M_mutant gliomas, ONC201 achieved a DCR of 64% (7/11) and a 6_month PFS rate of 36% (5/14), with 3 patients experiencing complete and durable regressions of thalamic lesions (Chi et al., 2018; SNO abstract ACTR_34). Data from pooled ONC201 monotherapy trials showed that 31% (9/29) of patients with recurrent H3F3A K28M_mutated glioma remain progression free at 6.5 months median follow_up (Arrillaga et al., 2019; ASCO abstract 3005). Although other H3F3A mutations have been reported (Johnson et al., 2017; 28912153), it is unclear whether these therapeutic strategies would be relevant in gliomas with H3F3A mutations other than K28M. Patients with pediatric H3 K27_altered diffuse midline glioma may benefit from radiotherapy, either as a single modality or combined with alkylating agents (NCCN Pediatric Central Nervous Systems Cancers, v1.2023).

This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSI_High has been reported in 3_8% of adult or pediatric astrocytomas and was generally not associated with Lynch syndrome (Alonso et al., 2001; 11280776, Rodr\u00edguez_Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2013; 24073290, Vladimirova et al., 2008; 18053027). Low_level MSI has been reported in 5_9% of glioblastoma (GBM) samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927, Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285, Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). A large_scale study did not find high_level microsatellite instability (MSI_H) in any of 129 GBM samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), although a small_scale study reported MSI_H in 4 of 15 pediatric GBMs and 1 of 12 adult GBMs (Szybka et al., 2003; 12908754). The frequency of MSI has been reported to be increased in relapsed compared to primary GBM (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), in GBMs with a previous lower grade astrocytoma (Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285), and in giant cell GBM compared to classic GBM (Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": [{"Name": "P278A, R337C, R267W", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": [{"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "P278A"}, {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "R337C"}, {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "R267W"}]}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). TP53 mutations have been reported in 18_40% of astrocytoma samples, and preferentially in anaplastic astrocytoma; one study reported TP53 loss of function and partially/fully functional mutations in 15% and 25% of anaplastic astrocytomas, respectively (Uno et al., 2005; 15914282, Uno et al., 2006; 16711514, Lass et al., 2012; 22844452, Faria et al., 2012; 23009112, Milinkovic et al., 2013; 24358143, Galatro et al., 2013; 23613880). Some studies suggest that the presence of a TP53 mutation is correlated with a favorable prognosis in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) (Schmidt et al., 2002; 11939587). One study reported that TP53 alterations were associated with poorer OS (12.9 months altered vs. 19.7 months wildtype, HR=1.58, p=0.0054) in IDH_wildtype GBM (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Mutation of TP53 is thought to be an early step in the tumorigenesis of astrocytomas, which can progress into anaplastic astrocytoma and then glioblastoma through gain of other genetic abnormalities such as loss of CDKN2A or RB1, followed by loss of PTEN (Nozaki et al., 1999; 11550308). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT_53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT_801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may also be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as APR_246 (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571, Lehmann et al., 2012; 22965953, Mohell et al., 2015; 26086967, Franssonet al., 2016; 27179933). In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, APR_246 combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). ATR inhibitor treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with biallelic inactivation of TP53 suppressed cell viability, promoted DNA damage, and attenuated xenograft growth in preclinical studies (Kwok et al., 2016; 26563132, Boudny et al., 2019; 30975914); however, ATR inhibitors as monotherapy had little effect on these parameters in solid tumor models in other preclinical studies (Dillon et al., 2017; 28062704, Middleton et al., 2018; 30127241). Therefore, it is unclear whether TP53 inactivation predicts sensitivity to ATR inhibition. One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Mar 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066).

This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Touat et al., 2020; 32322066, Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556, Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642). Anaplastic astrocytoma harbors a median TMB of 1.8 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 2% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). For pediatric patients, high TMB has been reported in a subset of high_grade gliomas, frequently in association with mutations in mismatch repair or proofreading genes and in TP53, whereas BRAF alterations or other oncogene fusions were observed more frequently in brain tumors harboring low TMB (Patel et al., 2020; 32386112, Johnson et al., 2017; 28912153). Increased TMB has been reported to correlate with higher tumor grade in glioma (Draaisma et al., 2015; 26699864) and glioblastoma (GBM) tissue samples with biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD) (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570), as well as with shorter OS of patients with diffuse glioma (Wang et al., 2020; 32164609). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In glioma, a lack of association between TMB and clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors has been reported (Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Touat et al., 2020; 32322066). However, multiple case studies have reported that patients with ultramutated gliomas driven by POLE mutations have benefited from treatment with anti_PD_1 (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556) or anti_PD_L1 (Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642) therapies. Therefore, although increased TMB alone may not be a strong biomarker for PD_1 or PD_L1 inhibitors in this cancer type, these agents may have efficacy for patients with glioma harboring both high TMB and POLE mutation.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "NF1", "Alteration": "R192*G2397RY2331fs*4rearrangement intron 25", "Title": "Efficacy and Safety of Targeted Precision Therapy in Refractory Tumor With Druggable Molecular Event", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB4, PARP, mTOR, MET, RET, ROS1, VEGFRs, BRAF, CDK4, CDK6", "Locations": "Shanghai (China)", "NCTID": "NCT03239015", "Note": "On the basis of clinical evidence and strong preclinical evidence, NF1 inactivation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors.
