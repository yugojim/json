In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). Amplification of EGFR has been associated with increased expression of EGFR mRNA and protein in several cancer types (Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Bhargava et al., 2005; 15920544, Yang et al., 2012; 22490401). A mutation of the EGFR gene, referred to as EGFRvIII, results from a gene rearrangement that deletes exons 2_7. This alteration causes an in_frame deletion of 801 base pairs encoding part of the extracellular ligand_binding domain (Nishikawa et al., 1994; 8052651). This deletion has shown to result in ligand_independent (constitutive) phosphorylation and activation of EGFR, as well as consequent tumorigenesis (Nishikawa et al., 1994; 8052651, Nedergaard et al., 2012; 22385404). Across several genomic studies of CNS tumors, EGFR amplification has been reported in 16.9% of anaplastic astrocytomas, and 39.7% of glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs)(Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031, Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509). EGFR alterations have been reported in 13.2% of anaplastic astrocytomas, 5.3_15.9% of glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs), and 0% of pilocytic astrocytomas in several genomic studies of CNS tumors (cbio_Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031, cbio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, cbio_Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, cbio_Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509). In GBMs, Missense mutations in the EGFR extracellular domain have been found in 10_15% of cases and approximately half have a low_level amplification of the mutated allele (Lee et al., 2006; 17177598, Vivanco et al., 2012; 22588883). In a study of IDH_wildtype GBM samples, EGFR alterations were detected in 50% (117/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed, including 41% (95/232) with a co_occurring EGFR amplification and mutation, 26% (61/232) with an EGFR domain truncation event, such as EGFRvIII, and 2.2% (5/232) with an EGFR fusion event (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). The EGFRvIII mutation has been variously reported in 6_46% of GBM samples (Nishikawa et al., 1994; 8052651, Shinojima et al., 2003; 14583498, Nishikawa et al., 2004; 15700833, Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176, Viana_Pereira et al., 2008; 18507036, Yoshimoto et al., 2008; 18223223, Larysz et al., 2011; 21455841, Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251, Lv et al., 2012; 22752145). No definitive correlation has been identified between EGFR amplification and length of survival in patients with GBM (Srividya et al., 2010; 20702468, Das et al., 2011; 20888234); however, EGFR amplification has been associated with prolonged survival in patients over the age of 60 with GBM (Smith et al., 2001; 11504770). The link between EGFRvIII status and prognosis is unclear, although some studies suggest that it may be linked to improved survival and response to chemotherapy (Montano et al., 2011; 22241957). In multiple glioblastoma (GBM) studies, the presence of EGFRvIII has not predicted clinical benefit from first_generation EGFR TKIs such as erlotinib (Van den Bent et al., 2009; 19204207, Haas_Kogen et al., 2005; 15956649, Brown et al., 2008; 18955445, Preusser et al., 2008; 18458820, Wen et al., 2014; 24470557, Gallego et al., 2013; 24352766) or gefitinib (Rich et al. 2004; 14638850, Uhm et al., 2011; 20510539, Preusser et al., 2008; 18458820). However, case reports have described patients with EGFRvIII_positive GBM responding to erlotinib (Doyle et al., 2018; 30410775, D Alessandris et al., 2013; 23132371, Custodio and Perez_Segura, 2010; 20462843, D Alessandris et al., 2018; 30306271). In a retrospective study of patients with GBM treated with erlotinib or gefitinib, co_expression of EGFRvIII with PTEN protein was the strongest predictor of response (P<0.001)(Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176), suggesting that activity in this setting is dependent on PTEN status (Mellinghoff et al., 2007; 17255257, Arif et al., 2018; 29492119). However, a prospective Phase 2 trial testing erlotinib monotherapy for patients with EGFRvIII and PTEN_positive recurrent glioblastoma reported minimal efficacy and was terminated (Gallego et al., 2013; 24352766). The second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib have shown minimal efficacy for patients with EGFRvIII glioblastoma (GBM)(Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Alshami et al., 2015; 26423602, Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). A Phase 1/2 study of afatinib, temozolomide, or the combination for patients with GBM reported clinical benefit, including for patients with EGFRvIII; however, temozolomide alone and in combination exhibited better responses than afatinib monotherapy (Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Alshami et al., 2015; 26423602). A Phase 2 trial of dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified GBM reported a DCR of 26% (5/19) among patients with EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII; however, the trial failed to meet its primary endpoint of 6_month PFS (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464). A retrospective biomarker analysis of another Phase 2 study of dacomitinib for patients with GBM found no association between EGFRvIII and clinical benefit (Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). Patients with glioma and co_occurring EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII have reported responses to osimertinib (Cardona et al., 2021; 34498213, Abousand et al., 2021; DOI: 10.26502/jcsct.5079114). However, a patient with multiple glioblastoma (GBM) tumors, one of which harbored EGFRvIII, experienced progression of the EGFRvIII_positive tumor during treatment with osimertinib (Makhlin et al., 2019; 31769726). On the basis of preclinical data, osimertinib inhibits EGFRvIIII_driven tumor growth in vitro (Chagoya et al., 2020; 32547705, Gao et al., 2021; 33910930). Novel approaches that specifically target EGFRvIII in glioblastoma (GBM), such as the vaccine rindopepimut, are under investigation in both clinical and preclinical studies. A Phase 2 trial reported significant improvement in OS for patients with EGFRvIII_positive GBM with rindopepimut in combination with bevacizumab compared to bevacizumab alone (HR=0.53, p=0.01)(Reardon et al., 2020; 32034072). However, a Phase 3 study of rindopepimut combined with temozolomide compared to temozolomide alone in newly diagnosed EGFRvIII_positive GBM patients was terminated after the interim analysis, due to a lack of clinical benefit as measured by OS (20 vs. 20 months)(Weller et al., 2017; 28844499). Clinical studies of the second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified gliomas have shown limited efficacy (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Blumenthal et al., 2016; 27531351); however, a small subset of patients has experienced clinical benefit (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). Multiple studies have failed to find a positive association between increased EGFR expression and clinical benefit from erlotinib or gefitinib for patients with glioblastoma (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176, Franceschi et al., 2007; 17353924, Chakravarti et al., 2013; 23182702, Hegi et al., 2011; 21471286, Rich et al. 2004; 14638850). There are conflicting data on the efficacy of anti_EGFR antibodies for the treatment of EGFR_amplified tumors. A meta_analysis of colorectal cancer patients treated with second_line or higher cetuximab or panitumumab observed an association between EGFR copy number gain and increased OS and PFS (Jiang et al., 2013; 23441167). However, studies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cancer found either no association or a negative association between EGFR copy number gain and survival after treatment with first_line cetuximab or panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy (Licitra et al., 2011; 21048039, Smyth et al., 2020; 33199443). The Phase 3 INTELLANCE trial of depatuxizumab mafodotin (ABT_414), an EGFR_targeted antibody_drug conjugate with a toxic payload, in patients with EGFR_amplified glioblastoma (GBM) was stopped for futility. Interim analysis demonstrated improved median PFS (mPFS) of ABT_414 monotherapy compared with placebo (HR=0.84); however, no OS benefit was observed (HR=1.01). Improved mPFS was also observed in patients harboring EGFRvIII (HR=0.73) but without an OS improvement (HR=0.95) (Lassman et al., 2019; Neuro_Oncology Abstract ACTR_21). The Phase 2 INTELLANCE trial demonstrated clinical benefit for EGFR_amplified GBM for the combination of ABT_414, temozolomide, and radiotherapy (HR=0.66, p=0.017), but there was no evidence of efficacy for ABT_414 monotherapy (HR=1.04, p=0.83)(Bent et al., 2020; 31747009). The presence of EGFR gene amplification or TERT promoter mutations are indicative of diffuse astrocytic glioma with molecular features of glioblastoma, WHO grade 4 in IDH1/2_wildtype tumors (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022) (Louis et al., 2021; 34185076).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

Panitumumab has shown efficacy as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy for patients with KRAS_wildtype colorectal cancer (Douillard et al., 2014; 24718886, Price et al., 2014; 24739896, Van Cutsem et al., 2007; 17470858) and has been investigated in a variety of other tumor types. For patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), data are conflicting; some trials of panitumumab in various lines and with different chemotherapy combinations have shown modest benefit (Vermorken et al., 2013; 23746666, Wirth et al., 2010; 19892746, Siano et al., 2017; 28592616) and others have reported no benefit (Mesia et al., 2015; 25596660, Giralt et al., 2015; 25596659, Siu et al., 2016; 27930762). A Phase 3 study of chemotherapy with or without panitumumab for patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancer was terminated for futility (Waddell et al., 2013; 23594787).

Osimertinib has been studied primarily for the treatment of EGFR_mutated NSCLC. A Phase 2 trial of osimertinib in combination with bevacizumab versus osimertinib monotherapy for patients with untreated advanced non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR del19 or L858R reported no difference in ORR (82% vs 86%) and median PFS (22.1 vs 20.2 months, HR 0.862 p=0.213) (Kenmotsu et al., 2022; 35636696).

No definitive correlation has been identified between EGFR amplification and length of survival in patients with GBM (Srividya et al., 2010; 20702468, Das et al., 2011; 20888234); however, EGFR amplification has been associated with prolonged survival in patients over the age of 60 with GBM (Smith et al., 2001; 11504770). The link between EGFRvIII status and prognosis is unclear, although some studies suggest that it may be linked to improved survival and response to chemotherapy (Montano et al., 2011; 22241957). In multiple glioblastoma (GBM) studies, the presence of EGFRvIII has not predicted clinical benefit from first_generation EGFR TKIs such as erlotinib (Van den Bent et al., 2009; 19204207, Haas_Kogen et al., 2005; 15956649, Brown et al., 2008; 18955445, Preusser et al., 2008; 18458820, Wen et al., 2014; 24470557, Gallego et al., 2013; 24352766) or gefitinib (Rich et al. 2004; 14638850, Uhm et al., 2011; 20510539, Preusser et al., 2008; 18458820). However, case reports have described patients with EGFRvIII_positive GBM responding to erlotinib (Doyle et al., 2018; 30410775, D Alessandris et al., 2013; 23132371, Custodio and Perez_Segura, 2010; 20462843, D Alessandris et al., 2018; 30306271). In a retrospective study of patients with GBM treated with erlotinib or gefitinib, co_expression of EGFRvIII with PTEN protein was the strongest predictor of response (P<0.001)(Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176), suggesting that activity in this setting is dependent on PTEN status (Mellinghoff et al., 2007; 17255257, Arif et al., 2018; 29492119). However, a prospective Phase 2 trial testing erlotinib monotherapy for patients with EGFRvIII and PTEN_positive recurrent glioblastoma reported minimal efficacy and was terminated (Gallego et al., 2013; 24352766). The second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib have shown minimal efficacy for patients with EGFRvIII glioblastoma (GBM)(Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Alshami et al., 2015; 26423602, Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). A Phase 1/2 study of afatinib, temozolomide, or the combination for patients with GBM reported clinical benefit, including for patients with EGFRvIII; however, temozolomide alone and in combination exhibited better responses than afatinib monotherapy (Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Alshami et al., 2015; 26423602). A Phase 2 trial of dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified GBM reported a DCR of 26% (5/19) among patients with EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII; however, the trial failed to meet its primary endpoint of 6_month PFS (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464). A retrospective biomarker analysis of another Phase 2 study of dacomitinib for patients with GBM found no association between EGFRvIII and clinical benefit (Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). Patients with glioma and co_occurring EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII have reported responses to osimertinib (Cardona et al., 2021; 34498213, Abousand et al., 2021; DOI: 10.26502/jcsct.5079114). However, a patient with multiple glioblastoma (GBM) tumors, one of which harbored EGFRvIII, experienced progression of the EGFRvIII_positive tumor during treatment with osimertinib (Makhlin et al., 2019; 31769726). On the basis of preclinical data, osimertinib inhibits EGFRvIIII_driven tumor growth in vitro (Chagoya et al., 2020; 32547705, Gao et al., 2021; 33910930). Novel approaches that specifically target EGFRvIII in glioblastoma (GBM), such as the vaccine rindopepimut, are under investigation in both clinical and preclinical studies. A Phase 2 trial reported significant improvement in OS for patients with EGFRvIII_positive GBM with rindopepimut in combination with bevacizumab compared to bevacizumab alone (HR=0.53, p=0.01)(Reardon et al., 2020; 32034072). However, a Phase 3 study of rindopepimut combined with temozolomide compared to temozolomide alone in newly diagnosed EGFRvIII_positive GBM patients was terminated after the interim analysis, due to a lack of clinical benefit as measured by OS (20 vs. 20 months)(Weller et al., 2017; 28844499). Clinical studies of the second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified gliomas have shown limited efficacy (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Blumenthal et al., 2016; 27531351); however, a small subset of patients has experienced clinical benefit (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). Multiple studies have failed to find a positive association between increased EGFR expression and clinical benefit from erlotinib or gefitinib for patients with glioblastoma (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176, Franceschi et al., 2007; 17353924, Chakravarti et al., 2013; 23182702, Hegi et al., 2011; 21471286, Rich et al. 2004; 14638850). There are conflicting data on the efficacy of anti_EGFR antibodies for the treatment of EGFR_amplified tumors. A meta_analysis of colorectal cancer patients treated with second_line or higher cetuximab or panitumumab observed an association between EGFR copy number gain and increased OS and PFS (Jiang et al., 2013; 23441167). However, studies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cancer found either no association or a negative association between EGFR copy number gain and survival after treatment with first_line cetuximab or panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy (Licitra et al., 2011; 21048039, Smyth et al., 2020; 33199443). The Phase 3 INTELLANCE trial of depatuxizumab mafodotin (ABT_414), an EGFR_targeted antibody_drug conjugate with a toxic payload, in patients with EGFR_amplified glioblastoma (GBM) was stopped for futility. Interim analysis demonstrated improved median PFS (mPFS) of ABT_414 monotherapy compared with placebo (HR=0.84); however, no OS benefit was observed (HR=1.01). Improved mPFS was also observed in patients harboring EGFRvIII (HR=0.73) but without an OS improvement (HR=0.95) (Lassman et al., 2019; Neuro_Oncology Abstract ACTR_21). The Phase 2 INTELLANCE trial demonstrated clinical benefit for EGFR_amplified GBM for the combination of ABT_414, temozolomide, and radiotherapy (HR=0.66, p=0.017), but there was no evidence of efficacy for ABT_414 monotherapy (HR=1.04, p=0.83)(Bent et al., 2020; 31747009). The presence of EGFR gene amplification or TERT promoter mutations are indicative of diffuse astrocytic glioma with molecular features of glioblastoma, WHO grade 4 in IDH1/2_wildtype tumors (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022) (Louis et al., 2021; 34185076).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

Panitumumab has shown efficacy as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy for patients with KRAS_wildtype colorectal cancer (Douillard et al., 2014; 24718886, Price et al., 2014; 24739896, Van Cutsem et al., 2007; 17470858) and has been investigated in a variety of other tumor types. For patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), data are conflicting; some trials of panitumumab in various lines and with different chemotherapy combinations have shown modest benefit (Vermorken et al., 2013; 23746666, Wirth et al., 2010; 19892746, Siano et al., 2017; 28592616) and others have reported no benefit (Mesia et al., 2015; 25596660, Giralt et al., 2015; 25596659, Siu et al., 2016; 27930762).

Osimertinib has been studied primarily for the treatment of EGFR_mutated NSCLC. A Phase 2 trial of osimertinib in combination with bevacizumab versus osimertinib monotherapy for patients with untreated advanced non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR del19 or L858R reported no difference in ORR (82% vs 86%) and median PFS (22.1 vs 20.2 months, HR 0.862 p=0.213) (Kenmotsu et al., 2022; 35636696).

The Phase 1b TATTON study of osimertinib in combination with selumetinib, savolitinib, or durvalumab for patients with previously treated EGFR_mutated NSCLC reported ORRs of 42% (15/36), 44% (8/18), and 44% (10/23), respectively (Oxnard et al., 2020; 32139298). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Cetuximab", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets EGFR.

PIK3CA alterations that have been characterized as activating, such as observed here, are predicted to be oncogenic (Kang et al., 2005; 15647370, Ikenoue et al., 2005; 15930273, Gymnopoulos et al., 2007; 17376864, Horn et al., 2008; 18317450, Rudd et al., 2011; 21266528, Hon et al., 2012; 22120714, Burke et al., 2012; 22949682, Wu et al., 2009; 19915146, Dbouk et al., 2010; 2103068, Dan et al., 2010; 20530683, Oda et al., 2008; 18829572, Zhao and Vogt, 2008; 18794883, Lui et al., 2013; 23619167, Ross et al., 2013; 22430209, Riviere et al., 2012; 22729224, Shibata et al., 2009; 19394761, Droguluk et al., 2015; 26627007, Croessmann et al., 2018; 29284706, Ng et al., 2018; 29533785, Spangle et al., 2020; 32929011, Chen et al., 2018; 29636477, Jin et al., 2021; 34779417). PIK3CA mutations have been reported in 9% of glioblastoma (GBM) samples analyzed in the TCGA dataset (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142), and other studies report the incidence of PIK3CA mutations in primary GBMs as 5_18% (Gallia et al., 2006; 17050665, Broderick et al., 2004; 15289301, El_Habr et al., 2010; 20569675). One study detected PIK3CA mutation in 16% (36/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). PIK3CA mutations have been reported in 5_23% of high_grade gliomas (including glioblastomas, anaplastic astrocytomas, and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas) (El_Habr et al., 2010; 20569675, Gallia et al., 2006; 17050665, Broderick et al., 2004; 15289301, Derakhshandeh_Peykar et al., 2011; 22026810, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890). While another study did not observe PIK3CA mutations in low_grade astrocytomas or in anaplastic astrocytomas, it did report high ERK and AKT activity (El_Habr et al., 2010; 20569675). One study found that PIK3CA mutation in glioblastoma (GBM) was associated with shorter median PFS in both a discovery cohort (6.9 vs. 12.4 months, HR=2.89, p=0.01) and in the TCGA cohort (6.1 vs. 9 months, p=0.008), but was not consistently associated with median OS (Tanaka et al., 2019; 31036078). In a study of IDH_wildtype GBM, patients with alterations in PI3K class I genes (PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PIK3CG, and PIK3R2) had significantly longer OS (20.0 months altered vs. 16.9 months wildtype, HR=0.62, p=0.002) and PFS (11.0 months altered vs. 7.4 months wildtype, p=0.0043); patients with PIK3CA alterations experienced an improved OS but this association was not highly significant (20.0 months altered vs. 18.1 months wildtype, p=0.0407)(Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Clinical and preclinical data in various tumor types indicate that PIK3CA activating alterations may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting PI3K (Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574, Juric et al., 2018; 29401002, Gallant et al., 2019; 30793038, Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23, Delestre et al., 2021; 34613809, Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Santin et al., 2020; 31934607, Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871), AKT (Andre et al., 2019; 31091374, Smyth et al., 2021; 33863913), or mTOR (Varnier et al., 2019; 31351267, Basse et al., 2018; 32914004, Sultova et al., 2021; 33277683, Mackay et al., 2014; 24166148, Myers et al., 2016; 27016228, Dhami et al., 2018; 29588307, Harris et al., 2019; 30863722, Hanna et al., 2018; 29301825). The Phase 2 NCI_MATCH study of copanlisib for patients with refractory solid tumors harboring PIK3CA mutations with or without PTEN loss met its primary endpoint with an ORR of 16% (4/25 PRs); responses (PR or SD >6 months) were seen in patients with ameloblastoma, liposarcoma, and carcinomas of the endometrium, ovary, esophagus, lung, and prostate (Damodaran et al., 2022; 35133871). However, the Phase 2 study of copanlisib for patients with endometrial carcinoma harboring PIK3CA hotspot mutations failed to report any objective responses (n=11)(Santin et al., 2020; 31934607). Two other studies of copanlisib for patients with genomically unselected tumors reported 1 CR and 2 PRs (1 unconfirmed) among 16 total patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors with or without PTEN alterations (Morschhauser et al., 2020; 31619463, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108). In the Phase 2 MATCH trial for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors, 28% (18/65) of patients experienced PFS lasting at least 6 months after treatment with taselisib; however, no ORs were observed in this study (Krop et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 101). A separate Phase 1b study of taselisib in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib for patients with PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors reported an ORR of 0% (n=12) and a DCR of 17% (2/12) (Pascual et al., 2021; 32958578). In a Phase 1 trial of the dual PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitor apitolisib, 79% (11/14) of patients with PIK3CA_mutated advanced solid tumors experienced disease control (3 PRs, 8 SDs) (Dolly et al., 2016; 26787751). The PI3K inhibitor alpelisib is approved as a single agent for the treatment of patients with PIK3CA_related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) (Canaud et al., 2021; ESMO Abstract LBA23), but has shown limited activity as monotherapy for PIK3CA_mutated solid tumors with a Phase 1a study reporting an ORR of 6.0% (8/134) and a DCR of 58% (78/134) (Juric et al., 2018; 29401002).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PIK3CA activating mutations may lead to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may therefore indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.

Studies in the literature have indicated that PTEN alterations (mutation or homozygous deletion) occur most frequently in glioblastoma (GBM), less frequently in anaplastic astrocytoma, and rarely in lower grade glioma subtypes including low grade astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, oligoastrocytoma, and ependymoma (Zhou et al., 1999; 10096247, Rasheed et al., 1997; 9331072, Davies et al., 1999; 10188904, Smith et al., 2001; 11504770, Lin et al., 1998; 9796977, Schmidt et al., 1999; 10560660, Kato et al., 2000; 11051241, Furnari et al., 2007; 17974913). One study detected PTEN mutation in 42% (97/232) and loss in 10% (24/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). In the TCGA dataset, PTEN mutation was observed in 23% of GBM cases and PTEN deletion was reported in 7% of cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142), while in the Lower Grade Glioma TCGA dataset, PTEN mutation was observed in 4% of cases and homozygous deletion observed in 1.2% of cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751). Decreased PTEN expression is associated with the higher grade GBM tumors (Sano et al., 1999; 10213484). Loss of PTEN correlated with significantly worse prognosis in all grades of gliomas (Lin et al., 1998; 9796977, Srividya et al., 2011; 21134002). PTEN loss or mutation leads to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway (Courtney et al., 2010; 20085938, Simpson and Parsons, 2001; 11237521, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Milella et al., 2017; 28220839). Clinical studies in glioblastoma have not observed an association between PTEN deficiency and response to everolimus or temsirolimus (Galanis et al., 2005; 15998902, Kreisl et al., 2009; 19018475, Mason et al., 2011; 22160854). Preclinical data indicate that PTEN loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Mendes_Pereira et al., 2009; 20049735, Shen et al., 2013; 23881923, Chatterjee et al., 2013; 23565244, McCormick et al., 2016; 26905328, Forster et al., 2011; 21468130), and clinical benefit has been observed for patients with PTEN_altered breast cancer including triple negative breast cancer (Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006, Eikesdal et al., 2021; 33242536), ovarian cancer (Dougherty et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 5536), uterine leiomyosarcoma (Pan et al., 2021; 33970096), and endometrial cancer (Forster et al., 2011; 21468130) treated with PARP inhibitors. However, some studies have reported a lack of association between PTEN mutation and PARP inhibitor sensitivity (Sandhu et al., 2013; 23810788, Romero et al., 2020; 32988624, Piha_Paul et al., 2018; AACR Abstract A096). PTEN mutations underlie several inherited disorders, collectively termed PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS), which include Cowden syndrome (CS) and its variant Lhermitte_Duclos disease (LD), Bannayan_Riley_Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), PTEN_related Proteus syndrome (PS), and Proteus_like syndrome (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191, Orloff and Eng, 2008; 18794875). The mutation rate for PTEN in these disorders ranges from 20 to 85% of patients (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191, Zbuk and Eng, 2007; 17167516). The estimated incidence of Cowden syndrome is 1/200,000, which may be an underestimate due to the high variability of this disorder (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191).

Certain germline polymorphisms of the GRM3 locus have been reported to affect motor and cognitive function as well as the risk of developing schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, and alcohol dependence (Cherlyn et al., 2010; 20060416, Lencer et al., 2014; 24682224, Casey et al., 2012; 21996756, O Brien et al., 2014; 25046171, Wolen et al., 2012; 22511924). GRM3 mutations have been most frequently reported in melanoma, with an incidence of 30% (6/20) in desmoplastic melanoma (Shain et al., 2015; 26343386), and an incidence of 13_18% in cutaneous melanoma (cBio_Hodis et al., 2012; 22817889, cBio_Krauthammer et al., 2012; 22842228, Prickett et al., 2011; 21946352).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). Low_level MSI has been reported in 5_9% of glioblastoma (GBM) samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927, Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285, Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). A large_scale study did not find high_level microsatellite instability (MSI_H) in any of 129 GBM samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), although a small_scale study reported MSI_H in 4 of 15 pediatric GBMs and 1 of 12 adult GBMs (Szybka et al., 2003; 12908754). The frequency of MSI has been reported to be increased in relapsed compared to primary GBM (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), in GBMs with a previous lower grade astrocytoma (Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285), and in giant cell GBM compared to classic GBM (Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "PPP2R1A", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "R260C", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "1.99", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "R260C"}}, "Interpretation": "PPP2R1A encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A), which is involved in regulation of the cell cycle transition from mitosis to interphase (Wurzenberger and Gerlich, 2011; 21750572). A spatially constrained pattern of somatic missense alterations in PPP2R1A, clustered around codons 179, 182, and 256, has been documented (McConechy et al, 2012; 22653804, Shih et al., 2011; 21435433, McConechy et al., 2011; 21381030, Zhao et al., 2013; 23359684, Kuhn et al., 2012; 22923510). Although the functional consequences of these PPP2R1A alterations have not been clearly characterized, they are presumed to disrupt binding of the PP2A regulatory and catalytic subunits, dysregulating normal PP2A function and cell cycle progression (McConechy et al., 2011; 21381030). PPP2R1A mutations have been reported in several subtypes of ovarian and uterine carcinoma, most frequently in uterine serous carcinoma (up to 26%) (COSMIC, cBioPortal, 2023)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878, Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). In addition, concurrent mutations in PPP2R1A, PIK3CA, and TP53 have been reported in cases of uterine serous carcinoma, and were also found in associated serous endometrial intraepithelial carcinomas, suggesting the alterations arose early in the pre_invasive stage of the disease (Kuhn et all, 2012; 22923510). PPP2R1A mutations have been reported in 9/42 carcinosarcoma samples analyzed (McConechy et al, 2012; 22653804). There are no targeted therapies available to directly address genomic alterations in PPP2R1A. Activation of PP2A with forskolin or the sphingosine analogue FTY720 has be shown to be beneficial in the context of CML and ALL (Perrotti and Neviani, 2013; 23639323), and is being investigated in solid tumors of the lung, breast, and colon (Cristobal et al., 2014; 24448818, Saddoughi et al., 2013; 23180565, Baldacchino et al., 2014; 24460909). In addition, other agents have been shown to upregulate PP2A activity in the context of various tumors (Chen et al., 2013; 24307892).

In the TCGA datasets, RB1 mutation or homozygous deletion was observed in 9% of glioblastomas (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142) and 2.5% of lower grade glioma cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751). In one study, loss of RB1 transcript expression was observed in 10.6% of glioblastomas and occurred more frequently in the proneural subtype (Goldhoff et al., 2012; 22157621). One study reports that mutation of RB1 is correlated with shorter survival in glioblastoma patients (B\u00e4cklund et al., 2003; 14519639). Several studies suggest that RB1, PTEN, and/or TP53 mutations are early events in the development of glioblastoma (Chow et al., 2011; 21397855, Nobusawa et al., 2010; 20406234, Deighton et al., 2010; 20175778).

A clinical study evaluating the Aurora kinase A inhibitor alisertib for patients with prostate cancer did not find an association between RB1 deletion and clinical benefit (Beltran et al., 2019; 30232224). Other approaches to target RB1 inactivation under investigation in preclinical studies include inhibitors of BCL_2 family members (Allaman_Pillet et al., 2013; 21955141) and activation of the NOTCH pathway (Viatour et al., 2011; 21875955). Mutations in RB1 underlie the development of retinoblastoma (RB), a rare tumor that arises at a rate of approximately 1:20,000 live births, with nearly 5,000 new cases worldwide per year (Chen et al., 2014; 24282159). Germline mutations in RB1 account for approximately 40% of RB tumors (Yun et al., 2011; 22553621) and are associated with an increased risk of developing secondary malignancies that include soft tissue and bone sarcoma and malignant melanoma (Houston et al., 2011; 21139478, Ng et al., 2010; 19959033).

In patients with glioblastoma (GBM), the prevalence of TERT promoter mutation is lower in pediatric primary GBM (11%) and adult secondary GBM (28%) compared with adult primary GBM (58_83%) (Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Killela et al., 2013; 23530248). One study detected TERT promoter mutations in 78% (181/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). TERT promoter mutation has been shown to be significantly associated with increased TERT gene expression in astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and GBM (Arita et al., 2013; 23764841). TERT promoter mutations significantly associate with poor prognosis in patients with GBM, although this correlation may be due to the association with primary GBM as opposed to IDH_positive secondary GBM (Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Reitman et al., 2013; 24217890, Arita et al., 2013; 23764841). In the context of IDH_wildtype glioma, TERT mutations are associated with reduced OS (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022). Therapeutic options for targeting tumors with TERT mutations are limited, although a variety of approaches have been investigated, including immunotherapies using TERT as a tumor_associated antigen and antisense oligonucleotide_ or peptide_based therapies. TERT peptide vaccines showed limited anticancer efficacy in clinical trials (Zanetti et al., 2017; 27245281); however, in one preclinical study, the combination of a TERT peptide vaccine and anti_CTLA_4 therapy suppressed tumor growth (Duperret at al., 2018; 29249395). A Phase 2 study of the TERT inhibitor imetelstat for patients with advanced non_small cell lung cancer reported no improvement in PFS or OS (Chiappori et al., 2015; 25467017). TERT mutations are associated with 1p/19q co_deletion in oligodendrogliomas, and are highly recurrent in IDH/ATRX_wildtype glioblastoma (GBM) (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022)(Weller et al., 2020; 33293629). The presence of EGFR gene amplification or TERT promoter mutations are indicative of diffuse astrocytic glioma with molecular features of glioblastoma, WHO grade 4 in IDH1/2_wildtype tumors (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v1.2022) (Louis et al., 2021; 34185076).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TP53", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "V272M", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"dnaFraction": "61.63", "isEquivocal": "false", "name": "V272M"}}, "Interpretation": "Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Alterations such as seen here may disrupt TP53 function or expression (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130, Zerdoumi et al., 2017; 28472496, Yamada et al., 2007; 17690113). In the TCGA dataset, TP53 alterations have been reported in 35% of glioblastomas (GBMs), with a high incidence in pediatric and secondary GBMs and a low incidence in primary GBMs (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2008; 18772890, Jha et al., 2011; 22089350). One study detected TP53 alterations in 31% (73/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed, with most of the events being mutations (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). TP53 mutations have been reported in 18_40% of astrocytoma samples, and preferentially in anaplastic astrocytoma; one study reported TP53 loss of function and partially/fully functional mutations in 15% and 25% of anaplastic astrocytomas, respectively (Uno et al., 2005; 15914282, Uno et al., 2006; 16711514, Lass et al., 2012; 22844452, Faria et al., 2012; 23009112, Milinkovic et al., 2013; 24358143, Galatro et al., 2013; 23613880). Some studies suggest that the presence of a TP53 mutation is correlated with a favorable prognosis in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) (Schmidt et al., 2002; 11939587). One study reported that TP53 alterations were associated with poorer OS (12.9 months altered vs. 19.7 months wildtype, HR=1.58, p=0.0054) in IDH_wildtype GBM (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Mutation of TP53 is thought to be an early step in the tumorigenesis of astrocytomas, which can progress into anaplastic astrocytoma and then glioblastoma through gain of other genetic abnormalities such as loss of CDKN2A or RB1, followed by loss of PTEN (Nozaki et al., 1999; 11550308). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633) or p53 gene therapy such as SGT53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628, Leung et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 4139). In a Phase 1 study, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited PRs in 9.7% and SDs in 53% of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) for patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) for patients who were TP53 wildtype (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). A Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin) reported a 32% (30/94, 3 CR) ORR and a 73% (69/94) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (Moore et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 5513). A smaller Phase 2 trial of adavosertib in combination with carboplatin achieved a 43% (9/21, 1 CR) ORR and a 76% (16/21) DCR for patients with platinum_refractory TP53_mutated ovarian cancer (Leijen et al., 2016; 27998224). The combination of adavosertib with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with TP53_mutated ovarian cancer also significantly increased PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). In the Phase 2 VIKTORY trial, patients with TP53_mutated metastatic and/or recurrent gastric cancer experienced a 24% (6/25) ORR with adavosertib combined with paclitaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834). A Phase 1 trial of neoadjuvant adavosertib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) elicited a 71% (5/7) response rate for patients with TP53 alterations (Mendez et al., 2018; 29535125). The Phase 2 FOCUS4_C trial for patients with TP53_ and RAS_mutated colorectal cancer reported improvement in PFS (3.61 vs. 1.87 months, HR=0.35, p=0.0022), but not OS (14.0 vs 12.8 months, p=0.93), following adavosertib treatment compared with active monitoring (Seligmann et al., 2021; 34538072). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT_53 in combination with docetaxel for patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including 2 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PRs and 2 instances of SD with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Missense mutations leading to TP53 inactivation may be sensitive to therapies that reactivate mutated p53 such as eprenetapopt. In a Phase 1b trial for patients with p53_positive high_grade serous ovarian cancer, eprenetapopt combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% DCR (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). A Phase 1 trial of eprenetapopt with pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors reported an ORR of 10% (3/29) (Park et al., 2022; 36084396). One or more of the TP53 variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with Li_Fraumeni syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2022)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare autosomal dominant disorder Li_Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776), including sarcomas (Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). For pathogenic TP53 mutations identified during tumor sequencing, the rate of germline mutations was 1% in the overall population and 6% in tumors arising before age 30 (Mandelker et al., 2019; 31050713). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. Variants seen in this gene have been reported to occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), an age_related process in which hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that allow for clonal expansion (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838, Xie et al., 2014; 25326804, Acuna_Hidalgo et al., 2017; 28669404, Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Fuster et al., 2018; 29420212). CH in this gene has been associated with increased mortality, risk of coronary heart disease, risk of ischemic stroke, and risk of secondary hematologic malignancy (Jaiswal et al., 2014; 25426837, Genovese et al., 2014; 25426838). Clinical management of patients with CH in this gene may include monitoring for hematologic changes and reduction of controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Steensma., 2018; 30504320). Comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors detects nontumor alterations that are due to CH (Severson et al., 2018; 29678827, Chabon et al., 2020; 32269342, Razavi et al., 2019; 31768066). Patient_matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell sequencing is required to conclusively determine if this alteration is present in tumor or is secondary to CH.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "04", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "04"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Touat et al., 2020; 32322066, Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556, Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642). Glioblastoma (GBM) harbors a median TMB of 2.7 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 4.2% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). For pediatric patients, high TMB has been reported in a subset of high_grade gliomas, frequently in association with mutations in mismatch repair or proofreading genes and in TP53, whereas BRAF alterations or other oncogene fusions were observed more frequently in brain tumors harboring low TMB (Patel et al., 2020; 32386112, Johnson et al., 2017; 28912153). Increased TMB has been reported to correlate with higher tumor grade in glioma (Draaisma et al., 2015; 26699864) and glioblastoma (GBM) tissue samples with biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD) (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570), as well as with shorter OS of patients with diffuse glioma (Wang et al., 2020; 32164609). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In glioma, a lack of association between TMB and clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors has been reported (Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Touat et al., 2020; 32322066). However, multiple case studies have reported that patients with ultramutated gliomas driven by POLE mutations have benefited from treatment with anti_PD_1 (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556) or anti_PD_L1 (Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642) therapies. Therefore, although increased TMB alone may not be a strong biomarker for PD_1 or PD_L1 inhibitors in this cancer type, these agents may have efficacy for patients with glioma harboring both high TMB and POLE mutation.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "EGFR", "Alteration": "EGFRvIIIamplification", "Title": "A Study of CC_95251, a Monoclonal Antibody Directed Against SIRP\u03b1, in Subjects With Advanced Solid and Hematologic Cancers", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1", "Target": "CD20, EGFR, SIRP_alpha", "Locations": "Seoul (Korea, Republic of), Heidelberg (Australia), Melbourne (Australia), Manchester (United Kingdom), Edmonton (Canada), Rouen (France), Oregon, Marseille (France), Creteil (France), Nantes Cedex 01 (France)", "NCTID": "NCT03783403", "Note": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.
