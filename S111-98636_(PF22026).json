In response to signals from the environment, EGFR passes biochemical messages to the cell that stimulate it to grow and divide (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008; 18337605). Amplification of EGFR has been associated with increased expression of EGFR mRNA and protein in several cancer types (Liang et al., 2010; 20637128, Bhargava et al., 2005; 15920544, Yang et al., 2012; 22490401). The EGFR A289V mutation, located in the extracellular domain, has been shown to be activating (Lee et al., 2006; 17177598). Glioblastoma cell lines harboring an EGFR A289V or A289D mutation were shown to be dependent on EGFR kinase activity (Vivanco et al., 2012; 22588883), and other mutations at this position are also likely activating. In addition, A289V is frequently associated with increased EGFR gene copy number (Lee et al., 2006; 17177598). Across several genomic studies of CNS tumors, EGFR alterations have been reported in 13.2% of anaplastic astrocytomas, 5.3_15.9% of glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs), and 0% of pilocytic astrocytomas (cbio_Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031, cbio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, cbio_Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, cbio_Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509). Across several genomic studies of CNS tumors, EGFR amplification has been reported in 16.9% of anaplastic astrocytomas, and 39.7% of glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs)(Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031, Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142, Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661, Thomas et al., 2017; 28472509). In the glioblastoma (GBM) TCGA dataset, putative high_level amplification of EGFR has been found in 48% of cases and mutation has been found in 21% of cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). Missense mutations in the EGFR extracellular domain have been found in 10_15% of GBMs and approximately half have a low_level amplification of the mutated allele (Lee et al., 2006; 17177598, Vivanco et al., 2012; 22588883). One study detected EGFR alterations in 50% (117/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed, including 41% (95/232) with a co_occurring EGFR amplification and mutation, 26% (61/232) with an EGFR domain truncation event, such as EGFRvIII, and 2.2% (5/232) with an EGFR fusion event (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). No definitive correlation has been identified between EGFR amplification and length of survival in patients with GBM (Srividya et al., 2010; 20702468, Das et al., 2011; 20888234); however, EGFR amplification has been associated with prolonged survival in patients over the age of 60 with GBM (Smith et al., 2001; 11504770). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer, EGFR activating mutations may predict sensitivity to EGFR TKIs, including erlotinib (Rosell et al., 2011; 22285168), gefitinib (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064), afatinib (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960), dacomitinib (Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), and osimertinib (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549); however, the data for patients with other tumor types are limited (Hong et al., 2020; 32749686, Kim et al., 2015; 26462025, Kim et al., 2015; 25424851, Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840, Cavalieri et al., 2018; 29734047, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Audet et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 6041). A case study of a patient with multiple glioblastoma (GBM) tumors, one of which harbored EGFR amplification and multiple missense mutations, reported a near_CR of the EGFR_amplified and _mutated tumor to osimertinib (Makhlin et al., 2019; 31769726). A case series of 11 patients with bithalamic gliomas with EGFR mutations suggested that treatment with EGFR inhibitors, including osimertinib, prolonged patient survival relative to other types of treatment; however, no patients attained PR or SD (Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840). Another case series of 2 patients with osimertinib_treated bithalamic gliomas with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations reported that one patient experienced no progression at 4 months of treatment and that another patient did not progress until after 6 months of treatment (Goyal et al., 2021; 33940677). Clinical studies of the second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified gliomas have shown limited efficacy (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Blumenthal et al., 2016; 27531351); however, a small subset of patients has experienced clinical benefit (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). Multiple studies have failed to find a positive association between increased EGFR expression and clinical benefit from erlotinib or gefitinib for patients with glioblastoma (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176, Franceschi et al., 2007; 17353924, Chakravarti et al., 2013; 23182702, Hegi et al., 2011; 21471286, Rich et al. 2004; 14638850). There are conflicting data on the efficacy of anti_EGFR antibodies for the treatment of EGFR_amplified tumors. A meta_analysis of colorectal cancer patients treated with second_line or higher cetuximab or panitumumab observed an association between EGFR copy number gain and increased OS and PFS (Jiang et al., 2013; 23441167). However, studies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cancer found either no association or a negative association between EGFR copy number gain and survival after treatment with first_line cetuximab or panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy (Licitra et al., 2011; 21048039, Smyth et al., 2020; 33199443). The Phase 3 INTELLANCE trial of depatuxizumab mafodotin (ABT_414), an EGFR_targeted antibody_drug conjugate with a toxic payload, in patients with EGFR_amplified glioblastoma (GBM) was stopped for futility. Interim analysis demonstrated improved median PFS (mPFS) of ABT_414 monotherapy compared with placebo (HR=0.84); however, no OS benefit was observed (HR=1.01). Improved mPFS was also observed in patients harboring EGFRvIII (HR=0.73) but without an OS improvement (HR=0.95) (Lassman et al., 2019; Neuro_Oncology Abstract ACTR_21). The Phase 2 INTELLANCE trial demonstrated clinical benefit for EGFR_amplified GBM for the combination of ABT_414, temozolomide, and radiotherapy (HR=0.66, p=0.017), but there was no evidence of efficacy for ABT_414 monotherapy (HR=1.04, p=0.83)(Bent et al., 2020; 31747009). The presence of EGFR gene amplification or TERT promoter mutations are indicative of diffuse astrocytic glioma with molecular features of glioblastoma, WHO grade 4 in IDH1/2_wildtype tumors (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021) (Louis et al., 2021; 34185076).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

In preclinical trials, cetuximab, matuzumab, and panitumumab were reported to be ineffective at blocking EGFR dimerization and activation in GBM cells expressing EGFR extracellular domain mutations (Gajadhar et al., 2012; 22232519). However, another study demonstrated that in patients with GBM harboring EGFR amplification but lacking expression of the EGFRvIII variant, treatment with cetuximab resulted in significantly better progression_free survival (PFS) and numerical (although not statistically significant) improvement in overall survival (OS) (Lv et al., 2012; 22752145). A Phase 3 trial of combined cetuximab and platinum/5_FU in patients with HNSCC demonstrated improved response compared to platinum/5_FU alone, but EGFR amplification was not shown to predict response to this treatment (Licitra et al., 2011; 21048039). A Phase 3 study of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma did not report any improved outcome in patients treated with a combination of cetuximab plus gemcitabine vs gemcitabine alone (Philip et al., 2010; 20606093). In a Phase 1/2 trial of 36 patients with metastatic castration_resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with cetuximab in combination with doxorubicin, stable disease was reported in approximately 63% of patients (Slovin et al., 2009; 19815486). A Phase 1 study of the combination therapy of cetuximab, erlotinib, and bevacizumab reported stable disease in 21% (7/34) of patients with non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Falchook et al., 2013; 23435217). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Erlotinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Erlotinib is a small_molecule inhibitor of EGFR.

For patients with esophageal or biliary cancer treated with erlotinib or gefitinib, elevated EGFR copy number or amplification is associated with clinical responses and longer survival (Petty et al., 2017; 28537764, Philip et al., 2006; 16809731, Xie et al., 2020; 32958820, Luo et al., 2020; 33026449, Lee et al., 2012; 22192731). </p> <p><b>Supporting Data:</b> In the MyPathway Phase 2a basket study for advanced solid tumors, 1 of 9 patients with EGFR activation mutations responded to erlotinib monotherapy; the responding patient had urethral adenocarcinoma (Hainsworth et al., 2018; 29320312). A patient with EGFR_mutated metastatic lacrimal gland adenoid cystic carcinoma experienced clinical benefit from erlotinib treatment that was ongoing at 14 months (Nie et al., 2018; 29998897). A clinical study of patients with glioblastoma (GBM) treated with gefitinib or erlotinib found that 9/49 (18%) had tumor shrinkage of 25% or more; in this study, the extracellular domain EGFRvIII mutation was correlated with response (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176). In a Phase 2 study of 65 patients with GBM or gliosarcoma, treatment with erlotinib, temozolomide, and radiotherapy resulted in longer progression_free survival relative to a historical control study utilizing a regimen of temozolomide and radiotherapy alone (19.3 months vs. 14.1 months)(Prados et al., 2009; 19075262). However, in a Phase 1/2 trial of erlotinib monotherapy in 11 patients with relapsed or refractory GBM or anaplastic astrocytoma, all patients showed disease progression and the drug showed significant toxicity (Kesavabhotla et al., 2012; 22946346). In addition, a Phase 2 trial of patients with recurrent or progressive GBM treated with erlotinib and sorafenib did not meet its objective of a 30% increase in overall survival time compared with historical controls; sorafenib was found to increase erlotinib clearance (Peereboom et al., 2013; 23328813). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Gefitinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Gefitinib targets the tyrosine kinase EGFR and is FDA approved to treat non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations in EGFR.

However, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of gefitinib combined with radiotherapy in 178 patients with GBM reported no overall survival benefit of added gefitinib, and EGFR expression was found to be of no prognostic value for patients treated with gefitinib plus radiotherapy (Chakravarti et al., 2013; 23182702). A Phase 2 trial of preoperative gefitinib treatment in patients with recurrent GBM reported that although EGFR phosphorylation was decreased in treated patients as compared to the control group, measurement of 12 downstream molecules revealed no significant changes (Hegi et al., 2011; 21471286). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Panitumumab", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Panitumumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets EGFR.

No definitive correlation has been identified between EGFR amplification and length of survival in patients with GBM (Srividya et al., 2010; 20702468, Das et al., 2011; 20888234); however, EGFR amplification has been associated with prolonged survival in patients over the age of 60 with GBM (Smith et al., 2001; 11504770). For patients with non_small cell lung cancer, EGFR activating mutations may predict sensitivity to EGFR TKIs, including erlotinib (Rosell et al., 2011; 22285168), gefitinib (Douillard et al., 2014; 24263064), afatinib (Sequist et al., 2013; 23816960), dacomitinib (Mok et al., 2018; 29864379), and osimertinib (Janne et al., 2015; 25923549); however, the data for patients with other tumor types are limited (Hong et al., 2020; 32749686, Kim et al., 2015; 26462025, Kim et al., 2015; 25424851, Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840, Cavalieri et al., 2018; 29734047, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Audet et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 6041). A case study of a patient with multiple glioblastoma (GBM) tumors, one of which harbored EGFR amplification and multiple missense mutations, reported a near_CR of the EGFR_amplified and _mutated tumor to osimertinib (Makhlin et al., 2019; 31769726). A case series of 11 patients with bithalamic gliomas with EGFR mutations suggested that treatment with EGFR inhibitors, including osimertinib, prolonged patient survival relative to other types of treatment; however, no patients attained PR or SD (Mondal et al., 2020; 32303840). Another case series of 2 patients with osimertinib_treated bithalamic gliomas with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations reported that one patient experienced no progression at 4 months of treatment and that another patient did not progress until after 6 months of treatment (Goyal et al., 2021; 33940677). Clinical studies of the second_generation EGFR TKIs afatinib and dacomitinib for patients with EGFR_amplified gliomas have shown limited efficacy (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886, Reardon et al., 2015; 25140039, Blumenthal et al., 2016; 27531351); however, a small subset of patients has experienced clinical benefit (Sepulveda_Sanchez et al., 2017; 28575464, Tanaka et al., 2019; 30644426, Chi et al., 2020; 32923886). Multiple studies have failed to find a positive association between increased EGFR expression and clinical benefit from erlotinib or gefitinib for patients with glioblastoma (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176, Franceschi et al., 2007; 17353924, Chakravarti et al., 2013; 23182702, Hegi et al., 2011; 21471286, Rich et al. 2004; 14638850). There are conflicting data on the efficacy of anti_EGFR antibodies for the treatment of EGFR_amplified tumors. A meta_analysis of colorectal cancer patients treated with second_line or higher cetuximab or panitumumab observed an association between EGFR copy number gain and increased OS and PFS (Jiang et al., 2013; 23441167). However, studies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cancer found either no association or a negative association between EGFR copy number gain and survival after treatment with first_line cetuximab or panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy (Licitra et al., 2011; 21048039, Smyth et al., 2020; 33199443). The Phase 3 INTELLANCE trial of depatuxizumab mafodotin (ABT_414), an EGFR_targeted antibody_drug conjugate with a toxic payload, in patients with EGFR_amplified glioblastoma (GBM) was stopped for futility. Interim analysis demonstrated improved median PFS (mPFS) of ABT_414 monotherapy compared with placebo (HR=0.84); however, no OS benefit was observed (HR=1.01). Improved mPFS was also observed in patients harboring EGFRvIII (HR=0.73) but without an OS improvement (HR=0.95) (Lassman et al., 2019; Neuro_Oncology Abstract ACTR_21). The Phase 2 INTELLANCE trial demonstrated clinical benefit for EGFR_amplified GBM for the combination of ABT_414, temozolomide, and radiotherapy (HR=0.66, p=0.017), but there was no evidence of efficacy for ABT_414 monotherapy (HR=1.04, p=0.83)(Bent et al., 2020; 31747009). The presence of EGFR gene amplification or TERT promoter mutations are indicative of diffuse astrocytic glioma with molecular features of glioblastoma, WHO grade 4 in IDH1/2_wildtype tumors (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021) (Louis et al., 2021; 34185076).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.

In preclinical trials, cetuximab, matuzumab, and panitumumab were reported to be ineffective at blocking EGFR dimerization and activation in GBM cells expressing EGFR extracellular domain mutations (Gajadhar et al., 2012; 22232519). However, another study demonstrated that in patients with GBM harboring EGFR amplification but lacking expression of the EGFRvIII variant, treatment with cetuximab resulted in significantly better progression_free survival (PFS) and numerical (although not statistically significant) improvement in overall survival (OS) (Lv et al., 2012; 22752145). A Phase 3 trial of combined cetuximab and platinum/5_FU in patients with HNSCC demonstrated improved response compared to platinum/5_FU alone, but EGFR amplification was not shown to predict response to this treatment (Licitra et al., 2011; 21048039). A Phase 3 study of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma did not report any improved outcome in patients treated with a combination of cetuximab plus gemcitabine vs gemcitabine alone (Philip et al., 2010; 20606093).

A patient with EGFR_mutated metastatic lacrimal gland adenoid cystic carcinoma experienced clinical benefit from erlotinib treatment that was ongoing at 14 months (Nie et al., 2018; 29998897). A clinical study of patients with glioblastoma (GBM) treated with gefitinib or erlotinib found that 9/49 (18%) had tumor shrinkage of 25% or more; in this study, the extracellular domain EGFRvIII mutation was correlated with response (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; 16282176). In a Phase 2 study of 65 patients with GBM or gliosarcoma, treatment with erlotinib, temozolomide, and radiotherapy resulted in longer progression_free survival relative to a historical control study utilizing a regimen of temozolomide and radiotherapy alone (19.3 months vs. 14.1 months)(Prados et al., 2009; 19075262). However, in a Phase 1/2 trial of erlotinib monotherapy in 11 patients with relapsed or refractory GBM or anaplastic astrocytoma, all patients showed disease progression and the drug showed significant toxicity (Kesavabhotla et al., 2012; 22946346). In addition, a Phase 2 trial of patients with recurrent or progressive GBM treated with erlotinib and sorafenib did not meet its objective of a 30% increase in overall survival time compared with historical controls; sorafenib was found to increase erlotinib clearance (Peereboom et al., 2013; 23328813). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": null, "GenericName": "Gefitinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Gefitinib targets the tyrosine kinase EGFR and is FDA approved to treat non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations in EGFR.

In the TCGA dataset, amplification of MDM4 was observed in 8.5% of glioblastoma cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). MDM4 amplification or amplification of the 1q32.1 chromosomal locus, which encompasses MDM4 and PIK3C2B, has been frequently reported, particularly in Grade 3 and 4 astrocytoma or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cases; one study reported MDM4 amplification in 27% (23/86) of astrocytoma samples (Arjona et al., 2005; 16319692, Schiffman et al., 2010; 20068183, Nobusawa et al., 2010; 20406234, Rao et al., 2010; 19609742, Jin et al., 2010; 20472715, Riemenschneider et al., 1999; 10626796).

Although alterations such as also seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. Studies in the literature have indicated that PTEN alterations (mutation or homozygous deletion) occur most frequently in glioblastoma (GBM), less frequently in anaplastic astrocytoma, and rarely in lower grade glioma subtypes including low grade astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, oligoastrocytoma, and ependymoma (Zhou et al., 1999; 10096247, Rasheed et al., 1997; 9331072, Davies et al., 1999; 10188904, Smith et al., 2001; 11504770, Lin et al., 1998; 9796977, Schmidt et al., 1999; 10560660, Kato et al., 2000; 11051241, Furnari et al., 2007; 17974913). One study detected PTEN mutation in 42% (97/232) and loss in 10% (24/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). In the TCGA dataset, PTEN mutation was observed in 23% of GBM cases and PTEN deletion was reported in 7% of cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142), while in the Lower Grade Glioma TCGA dataset, PTEN mutation was observed in 4% of cases and homozygous deletion observed in 1.2% of cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751). Decreased PTEN expression is associated with the higher grade GBM tumors (Sano et al., 1999; 10213484). Loss of PTEN correlated with significantly worse prognosis in all grades of gliomas (Lin et al., 1998; 9796977, Srividya et al., 2011; 21134002). PTEN loss or mutation leads to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway (Courtney et al., 2010; 20085938, Simpson and Parsons, 2001; 11237521, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Milella et al., 2017; 28220839). Clinical studies in glioblastoma have not observed an association between PTEN deficiency and response to everolimus or temsirolimus (Galanis et al., 2005; 15998902, Kreisl et al., 2009; 19018475, Mason et al., 2011; 22160854). Preclinical data indicate that PTEN loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Mendes_Pereira et al., 2009; 20049735, Shen et al., 2013; 23881923, Chatterjee et al., 2013; 23565244, McCormick et al., 2016; 26905328, Forster et al., 2011; 21468130), and clinical benefit has been observed for patients with PTEN_altered breast cancer including triple negative breast cancer (Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006, Eikesdal et al., 2021; 33242536), ovarian cancer (Dougherty et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 5536), uterine leiomyosarcoma (Pan et al., 2021; 33970096), and endometrial cancer (Forster et al., 2011; 21468130) treated with PARP inhibitors. However, some studies have reported a lack of association between PTEN mutation and PARP inhibitor sensitivity (Sandhu et al., 2013; 23810788, Romero et al., 2020; 32988624, Piha_Paul et al., 2018; AACR Abstract A096). In a retrospective analysis of 66 patients with glioblastoma, tumors from nivolumab or pembrolizumab non_responders were significantly enriched for PTEN mutations (Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Peiwen et al., 2019; AACR Abstract A060). One or more of the PTEN variants observed here has been described in the ClinVar database as a likely pathogenic or pathogenic germline mutation (by an expert panel or multiple submitters) associated with hamartoma tumor syndrome (ClinVar, Sep 2021)(Landrum et al., 2018; 29165669). Follow_up germline testing would be needed to distinguish whether the finding in this patient is somatic or germline. PTEN mutations underlie several inherited disorders, collectively termed PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS), which include Cowden syndrome (CS) and its variant Lhermitte_Duclos disease (LD), Bannayan_Riley_Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), PTEN_related Proteus syndrome (PS), and Proteus_like syndrome (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191, Orloff and Eng, 2008; 18794875). The mutation rate for PTEN in these disorders ranges from 20 to 85% of patients (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191, Zbuk and Eng, 2007; 17167516). The estimated incidence of Cowden syndrome is 1/200,000, which may be an underestimate due to the high variability of this disorder (Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008; 18781191).

Although alterations such as also seen here have not been fully characterized and are of unknown functional significance, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. Studies in the literature have indicated that PTEN alterations (mutation or homozygous deletion) occur most frequently in glioblastoma (GBM), less frequently in anaplastic astrocytoma, and rarely in lower grade glioma subtypes including low grade astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, oligoastrocytoma, and ependymoma (Zhou et al., 1999; 10096247, Rasheed et al., 1997; 9331072, Davies et al., 1999; 10188904, Smith et al., 2001; 11504770, Lin et al., 1998; 9796977, Schmidt et al., 1999; 10560660, Kato et al., 2000; 11051241, Furnari et al., 2007; 17974913). One study detected PTEN mutation in 42% (97/232) and loss in 10% (24/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). In the TCGA dataset, PTEN mutation was observed in 23% of GBM cases and PTEN deletion was reported in 7% of cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142), while in the Lower Grade Glioma TCGA dataset, PTEN mutation was observed in 4% of cases and homozygous deletion observed in 1.2% of cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751). Decreased PTEN expression is associated with the higher grade GBM tumors (Sano et al., 1999; 10213484). Loss of PTEN correlated with significantly worse prognosis in all grades of gliomas (Lin et al., 1998; 9796977, Srividya et al., 2011; 21134002). PTEN loss or mutation leads to activation of the PI3K_AKT_mTOR pathway and may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway (Courtney et al., 2010; 20085938, Simpson and Parsons, 2001; 11237521, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27672108, Milella et al., 2017; 28220839). Clinical studies in glioblastoma have not observed an association between PTEN deficiency and response to everolimus or temsirolimus (Galanis et al., 2005; 15998902, Kreisl et al., 2009; 19018475, Mason et al., 2011; 22160854). Preclinical data indicate that PTEN loss or inactivation may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Mendes_Pereira et al., 2009; 20049735, Shen et al., 2013; 23881923, Chatterjee et al., 2013; 23565244, McCormick et al., 2016; 26905328, Forster et al., 2011; 21468130), and clinical benefit has been observed for patients with PTEN_altered breast cancer including triple negative breast cancer (Gruber et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3006, Eikesdal et al., 2021; 33242536), ovarian cancer (Dougherty et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 5536), uterine leiomyosarcoma (Pan et al., 2021; 33970096), and endometrial cancer (Forster et al., 2011; 21468130) treated with PARP inhibitors.

Both p15INK4b and p16INK4a bind to and inhibit CDK4 and CDK6, thereby maintaining the growth_suppressive activity of the Rb tumor suppressor; loss or inactivation of either p15INK4b or p16INK4a contributes to dysregulation of the CDK4/6_cyclin_Rb pathway and loss of cell cycle control (Gazzeri et al., 1998; 9484839, Roussel, 1999; 10498883). The tumor suppressive functions of p14ARF involve stabilization and activation of p53, via a mechanism of MDM2 inhibition (Sherr et al., 2005; 16869746, Ozenne et al., 2010; 20549699). One or more alterations observed here are predicted to result in p16INK4a loss of function (Ruas et al., 1999; 10498896, Jones et al., 2007; 17909018, Haferkamp et al., 2008; 18843795, Huot et al., 2002; 12417717, Rizos et al., 2001; 11518711, Gombart et al., 1997; 9324288, Yang et al., 1995; 7780957, Parry and Peters, 1996; 8668202, Greenblatt et al., 2003; 12606942, Yarbrough et al., 1999; 10491434, Poi et al., 2001; 11255261, Byeon et al., 1998; 9660926, Kannengiesser et al., 2009; 19260062, Lal et al., 2000; 10719365, Koh et al., 1995; 7777061, McKenzie et al., 2010; 20340136, Miller et al., 2011; 21462282, Arap et al., 1997; 905385, Scaini et al., 2014; 24659262, Jenkins et al., 2013; 23190892, Walker et al., 1999; 10389768, Rutter et al., 2003; 12853981). One or more alterations seen here have been observed in the context of cancer but have not been characterized and their effect on p14ARF function is unclear. Concurrent putative homozygous deletion of CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been reported in 35% of patients with gliomas (cBio_Ceccarelli et al., 2016; 26824661) and detected more frequently in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; 58%)(cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142) than in those with lower grade gliomas (13%) (cBioPortal, Sep 2021)(Cerami et al., 2012; 22588877, Gao et al., 2013; 23550210). In other studies, loss of CDKN2A/B by deletion has been reported in up to 78% of astrocytomas (including anaplastic astrocytomas and GBM) (Verhaak et al., 2010; 20129251, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337, Weber et al., 2007; 16909113). A study found homozygous deletion of both p16INK4a and p14ARF in 26% (13/50) of glioblastomas (GBMs); 18% (9/50) of cases showed homozygous deletion of the p14ARF_encoding locus alone (Nakamura et al., 2001; 11303791). One study detected CDKN2A/B loss in 69% (161/232) and mutation in 2.6% (6/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). Decreased p14ARF and p16INK4a expression levels were found to be tightly associated in a study of glioma samples (Chakravarti et al., 2001; 11489817). Homozygous deletion of the genomic region including CDKN2A and CDKN2B has been found to be associated with poor prognosis in GBM and likely serves as an early event in GBM progression (Feng et al., 2012; 21713760, Sottoriva et al., 2013; 23412337). In addition, expression of p16INK4a has been found to be lower in patients with high grade malignant gliomas compared to patients with low grade gliomas, and loss of p16INK4a expression has been associated with shorter overall survival in pilocytic astrocytomas (Raabe et al., 2011; 21636552, Liu et al., 2011; 21843312). Preclinical data suggest that tumors with loss of p16INK4a function may be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as abemaciclib, ribociclib, and palbociclib (Konecny et al., 2011; 21278246, Katsumi et al., 2011; 21871868, Cen et al., 2012; 22711607, Logan et al., 2013; 23898052). Although case studies have reported that patients with breast cancer or uterine leiomyosarcoma harboring CDKN2A loss responded to palbociclib treatment (Elvin et al., 2017; 28283584, Gao et al., 2015; 26715889), multiple other clinical studies have shown no significant correlation between p16INK4a loss or inactivation and therapeutic benefit of these agents (Gopalan et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 8077, Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528, Konecny et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5557)(DeMichele et al., 2014; 25501126, Finn et al., 2015; 25524798, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767, Johnson et al., 2014; 24797823); it is not known whether CDK4/6 inhibitors would be beneficial in this case. Although preclinical studies have suggested that loss of p14ARF function may be associated with reduced sensitivity to MDM2 inhibitors (Van Maerken et al., 2011; 21460101, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357), the clinical relevance of p14ARF as a predictive biomarker is not clear. Germline CDKN2A mutation is associated with melanoma_pancreatic cancer syndrome, a condition marked by increased risk of developing malignant melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer (Whelan et al., 1995; 7666917). Mutation carriers within families may develop either or both types of cancer, and melanoma cases may be referred to as familial or hereditary melanoma (Hansson, 2010; 20687502, Hogg et al., 1998; 9479083). CDKN2A is the most implicated gene in familial melanoma, with germline mutations present in 16% to 20% of familial melanoma cases (De Unamuno et al., 2018; 29543703, Soura et al., 2016; 26892650, Huerta et al., 2018; 29405243). CDKN2A alteration has also been implicated in familial melanoma_astrocytoma syndrome, an extremely rare tumor association characterized by dual predisposition to melanoma and nervous system tumors (Kaufman et al., 1993; 8414022, Bahuau et al., 1998; 9622062, Chan et al., 2017; 28699883). In the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of CDKN2A is recommended.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Microsatellite status", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "MS_Stable", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "MS_Stable"}}, "Interpretation": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). Low_level MSI has been reported in 5_9% of glioblastoma (GBM) samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927, Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285, Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). A large_scale study did not find high_level microsatellite instability (MSI_H) in any of 129 GBM samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), although a small_scale study reported MSI_H in 4 of 15 pediatric GBMs and 1 of 12 adult GBMs (Szybka et al., 2003; 12908754). The frequency of MSI has been reported to be increased in relapsed compared to primary GBM (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), in GBMs with a previous lower grade astrocytoma (Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285), and in giant cell GBM compared to classic GBM (Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI_H tumors to respond to anti_PD_1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI_H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non_MSI_H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., 2016; ASCO_SITC Abstract P60).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "TERT", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "promoter _146C>T", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "promoter _146C>T"}}, "Interpretation": "Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT, or hTERT) is a catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex, which is required to maintain appropriate chromosomal length (Shay et al., 2011; 22015685).

Mutations within the promoter region of TERT that confer enhanced TERT promoter activity have been reported in two hotspots, located at _124 bp and _146 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (also termed C228T and C250T, respectively)(Horn et al., 2013; 23348503, Huang et al., 2014; 23348506, Vinagre et al., 2013; 23887589), as well as tandem mutations at positions \u2013124/\u2013125 bp and \u2013138/\u2013139 bp (Horn et al., 2013; 23348503). TERT promoter mutations have been reported in 51_59% of gliomas (Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Killela et al., 2014; 24722048), most frequently in glioblastoma (GBM, 54_84%), gliosarcoma (81%), oligodendroglioma (78%), and historically in oligoastrocytomas (25_31%) but less frequently in lower grade astrocytomas (10_18%) and in only 1% of ependymomas (Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Liu et al., 2013; 23603989, Koelsche et al., 2013; 24154961, Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Killela et al., 2014; 24722048). In patients with glioblastoma (GBM), the prevalence of TERT promoter mutation is lower in pediatric primary GBM (11%) and adult secondary GBM (28%) compared with adult primary GBM (58_83%) (Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Killela et al., 2013; 23530248). One study detected TERT promoter mutations in 78% (181/232) of IDH_wildtype GBM samples analyzed (Yan et al. 2020; DOI:10.1200/PO.19.00385). TERT promoter mutation has been shown to be significantly associated with increased TERT gene expression in astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and GBM (Arita et al., 2013; 23764841). TERT promoter mutations significantly associate with poor prognosis in patients with GBM, although this correlation may be due to the association with primary GBM as opposed to IDH_positive secondary GBM (Killela et al., 2013; 23530248, Nonoguchi et al., 2013; 23955565, Reitman et al., 2013; 24217890, Arita et al., 2013; 23764841). In the context of IDH_wildtype glioma, TERT mutations are associated with reduced OS (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021). Therapeutic options for targeting tumors with TERT mutations are limited, although a variety of approaches have been investigated, including immunotherapies using TERT as a tumor_associated antigen and antisense oligonucleotide_ or peptide_based therapies. TERT peptide vaccines showed limited anticancer efficacy in clinical trials (Zanetti et al., 2017; 27245281); however, in one preclinical study, the combination of a TERT peptide vaccine and anti_CTLA_4 therapy suppressed tumor growth (Duperret at al., 2018; 29249395). A Phase 2 study of the TERT inhibitor imetelstat for patients with advanced non_small cell lung cancer reported no improvement in PFS or OS (Chiappori et al., 2015; 25467017). TERT mutations are associated with 1p/19q co_deletion in oligodendrogliomas, and are highly recurrent in IDH/ATRX_wildtype glioblastoma (GBM) (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021)(Weller et al., 2020; 33293629). The presence of EGFR gene amplification or TERT promoter mutations are indicative of diffuse astrocytic glioma with molecular features of glioblastoma, WHO grade 4 in IDH1/2_wildtype tumors (NCCN CNS Cancers Guidelines, v2.2021) (Louis et al., 2021; 34185076).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "Tumor Mutation Burden", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "00", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "00"}}, "Interpretation": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein_coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), treatment with temozolomide_based chemotherapy in glioma (Johnson et al., 2014; 24336570, Choi et al., 2018; 29452419), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Touat et al., 2020; 32322066, Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556, Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642). Glioblastoma (GBM) harbors a median TMB of 2.7 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 4.2% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). For pediatric patients, high TMB has been reported in a subset of high_grade gliomas, frequently in association with mutations in mismatch repair or proofreading genes and in TP53, whereas BRAF alterations or other oncogene fusions were observed more frequently in brain tumors harboring low TMB (Patel et al., 2020; 32386112, Johnson et al., 2017; 28912153). Increased TMB has been reported to correlate with higher tumor grade in glioma (Draaisma et al., 2015; 26699864) and glioblastoma (GBM) tissue samples with biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD) (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570), as well as with shorter OS of patients with diffuse glioma (Wang et al., 2020; 32164609). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In glioma, a lack of association between TMB and clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors has been reported (Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Touat et al., 2020; 32322066). However, multiple case studies have reported that patients with ultramutated gliomas driven by POLE mutations have benefited from treatment with anti_PD_1 (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556) or anti_PD_L1 (Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642) therapies. Therefore, although increased TMB alone may not be a strong biomarker for PD_1 or PD_L1 inhibitors in this cancer type, these agents may have efficacy for patients with glioma harboring both high TMB and POLE mutation.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "EGFR", "Alteration": "A289Vamplification", "Title": "Efficacy and Safety of Targeted Precision Therapy in Refractory Tumor With Druggable Molecular Event", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "EGFR, ERBB4, ERBB2, PARP, mTOR, MET, ROS1, RET, VEGFRs, BRAF, CDK4, CDK6", "Locations": "Shanghai (China)", "NCTID": "NCT03239015", "Note": "EGFR activating mutations, rearrangements, or amplification may predict sensitivity to EGFR_targeted therapies.
