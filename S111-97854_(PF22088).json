CDK4 and its functional homolog CDK6 are activated by D_type cyclins and promote cell cycle progression by inactivating the tumor suppressor Rb (Weinberg et al., 1995; 7736585, Musgrove et al., 2011; 21734724). Amplification of the chromosomal region that includes CDK4 has been reported in multiple cancer types, including lung cancer, glioblastoma, and liposarcoma, and has been associated with overexpression of CDK4 protein (Wikman et al., 2005; 15543620, Rao et al., 2010; 19609742, Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Chung et al., 2009; 19574885, Ragazzini et al., 2004; 15024701, Dujardin et al., 2011; 21336260, Zhang et al., 2013; 23393200, Horvai et al., 2009; 19734852). CDK4 amplification has been observed in 9.4% of glioma cases (cBio_Jonsson et al., 2019; 31263031). A study has reported amplification of the 12q14_15 region, where CDK4 and MDM2 reside, in 4.8% (2/42) of glioblastomas (Zheng et al., 2013; 23796897). Amplification of CDK4 and corresponding increased CDK4 protein expression has been reported to be associated with a poorer patient outcome in anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma (Kim et al., 2010; 20080666, Ruano et al., 2009; 19141386, Fischer et al., 2008; 18403636, B\u00e4cklund et al., 2005; 15970925). CDK4 amplification or activation may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors such as abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib (Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Flaherty et al., 2012; 22090362, Patnaik et al., 2016; 27217383, Infante et al., 2016; 27542767). Clinical benefit has been reported for limited tumor types including patients with CDK4_amplified liposarcoma and sarcoma in response to treatment with abemaciclib (Dickson et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 11004), palbociclib (Dickson et al., 2013; 23569312, Dickson et al., 2016; 27124835), and ribociclib (Peguero et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 2528).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": [{"nctId": "NCT04282031", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03239015", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02933736", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04801966", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02981940", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05159245", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT03994796", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT04116541", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT05252416", "Include": "true"}, {"nctId": "NCT02896335", "Include": "true"}]}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "KIT", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "KIT (also called c_KIT) encodes a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor that, upon ligand binding and dimerization, activates the PI3K_AKT and RAS_MAPK signaling pathways (Linnekin, 1999; 10582339). KIT aberrations, including point mutations, translocations, amplification, and overexpression, have been associated with various malignancies, and KIT is considered an oncoprotein (Fletcher, 2004; 15175998). KIT has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210) and may be biologically relevant in this context (Zack et al., 2013; 24071852, Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). In the TCGA datasets, KIT amplification has been reported in 2.5% of lower grade gliomas (grades 2 and 3)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751) and 9.2% of glioblastomas (Grade 4 astrocytoma)(cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). KIT amplification has been variously reported in 4_47% of glioblastomas in the scientific literature (Nobusawa et al., 2011; 21382095, Joensuu et al., 2005; 16021678, Burford et al., 2013; 23990986). Amplification of KIT has been strongly correlated with the presence of KDR and/or PDGFRA amplification in glioblastoma (Joensuu et al., 2005; 16021678, Holtkamp et al., 2007; 17504929, Puputti et al., 2006; 17189383). One study found no correlation between KIT amplification and overall survival in patients with glioblastoma, while a separate study reported that overexpression of KIT was associated with tumor grade and shorter survival in patients with malignant glioma (Nobusawa et al., 2011; 21382095, Skardelly et al., 2009; 19701495). On the basis of clinical evidence, primarily in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), melanoma, AML, and systemic mastocytosis, KIT activating alterations are associated with sensitivity to TKIs including imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib, dasatinib, nilotinib, pazopanib, regorafenib, ponatinib, midostaurin, apatinib, avapritinib, and ripretinib (Heinrich et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 10506, Heinrich et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 11011, DeAngelo et al., 2017; ASH Abstract 2, Evans et al., 2017; 29093181, Abbaspour Babaei et al., 2016; 27536065, Ramaswamy et al., 2016; 27563456, Demetri et al., 2013; 23177515, Gotlib et al., 2016; 27355533, Jawhar et al., 2017; 28424161, Xu et al., 2014; 25031773, Gotlib et al., 2005; 15972446, George et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 11511, Luo et al., 2017; 29066909). The use of mTOR inhibitors as an alternative therapeutic strategy has demonstrated limited success in KIT_mutated, imatinib_resistant melanoma, with 1 PR and 3 SD observed for 4 patients treated with everolimus (Si et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract 8562, Si et al., 2012; 22162580). However, no responses were observed for 10 patients with mastocytosis following everolimus monotherapy, with 8/10 patients harboring the KIT D816V mutation (Parikh et al., 2010; 20038218). The role of KIT amplification as a biomarker for response to mTOR inhibitors has not been investigated (PubMed, Mar 2022). Clinical benefit has been observed for patients with KIT amplified or overexpressing tumors following treatment with imatinib (Wei et al., 2019; 30075827, Hodi et al., 2013; 23775962, Carvajal et al., 2011; 21642685, Guo et al., 2011; 21690468, Debiec_Rychter et al., 2005; 15685537, DeMatteo et al., 2009; 19303137, Faivre et al., 2005; 16135502, Hotte et al., 2005; 15659505, Alcedo et al., 2004; 15350030, Brandwein et al., 2011; 21403650, Reardon et al., 2009; 19904263), nilotinib (Lee et al., 2015; 26424760), sorafenib (Llovet et al., 2012; 22374331, Zhang et al., 2013; 23058498, Seino et al., 2014; 25450081, Li et al., 2009; 18846437), and sunitinib (Minor et al., 2012; 22261812, Mahipal et al., 2012; 23114504), suggesting that KIT amplification may be sensitive to these inhibitors. However, evidence demonstrating clinical benefit for regorafenib, dasatinib, pazopanib, or ponatinib in the context of KIT amplified or overexpressing tumors is limited. One patient with KIT/PDGFRA/KDR_amplified GBM experienced a PR on ripretinib (de Groot at el., 2017; SNO Abstract ACTR_02, Jaku et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 2515).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "KIT amplification or activating mutations may predict sensitivity to small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

For imatinib_resistant Japanese patients with CML, a Phase 2 trial reported a 47.8% major medical response rate to treatment with nilotinib at 12 months (Takahashi et al., 2014; 24650752). A Phase 3 clinical trial of single_agent nilotinib in 240 patients with advanced GIST who failed prior treatment with imatinib or sunitinib reported no significant difference in progression_free survival between nilotinib and the best supportive care, but did report increased overall survival for nilotinib_treated patients (Reichardt et al., 2012; 22357255). A Phase 2 trial has shown that nilotinib was well tolerated and suggested it may be particularly useful for treating patients with GIST harboring mutations in KIT exon 17 (Cauchi et al., 2012; 22119758).

MDM2 acts to prevent the activity of the tumor suppressor p53; therefore, overexpression or amplification of MDM2 may be oncogenic (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675, Cordon_Cardo et al., 1994; 8306343). Overexpression or amplification of MDM2 is frequent in cancer (Beroukhim et al., 2010; 20164920). Although two retrospective clinical studies suggest that MDM2 amplification may predict a short time_to_treatment failure on anti_PD_1/PD_L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors, with 4/5 patients with MDM2 amplification (Kato et al., 2017; 28351930) and 2/3 patients with MDM2 or MDM4 amplification (Singavi et al., 2017; ESMO Abstract 1140PD) experiencing tumor hyperprogression, amplification of MDM2 or MDM4 was not associated with shorter progression_free survival (PFS) in a retrospective analysis of non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) outcomes with immune checkpoint inhibitors (hazard ratio of 1.4, p=0.44)(Rizvi et al., 2018; 29337640).

Amplification of MDM2 has been associated with poor survival in patients with glioblastoma (Fischer et al., 2010; 19839052, Zheng et al., 2013; 23796897). MDM2 antagonists disrupt the MDM2_p53 interaction, thereby stabilizing p53 (Cheok et al., 2011; 20975744). Preclinical studies have suggested that the amplification of MDM2, in the absence of concurrent TP53 mutations, may increase sensitivity to these agents (Ohnstad et al., 2013; 23165797, Gamble et al., 2012; 21725357). Preliminary Phase 1 studies of the MDM2_p53 antagonist alrizomadlin (APG_115) reported a PR in a patient with liposarcoma harboring an MDM2 amplification and wildtype for TP53 and SD in 21%\u201338% (6/28 and 5/13, respectively) of patients in genomically unselected solid tumors (Zhang et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3124, Rasco et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 3126). A Phase 2 trial of alrizomadlin in combination with pembrolizumab reported a PR in 1 of 3 patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor that had failed standard therapy, as well as PRs in patients with multiple types of solid tumors that had failed immunotherapy, including 1 out of 14 patients with non_small cell lung cancer; 1 out of 5 patients with urothelial carcinoma; and 2 out of5, 1 out of 5, and 1 out of 11 patients with mucosal, uveal, and cutaneous melanoma, respectively (Tolcher et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 2506). Phase 1b studies of the MDM2 inhibitor idasanutlin for refractory AML in combination with cytarabine or venetoclax reported anti_leukemic response rates of 33% (25/75) and 37% (11/30), respectively (Martinelli et al., 2016; EHA21 Abstract S504, Daver et al., 2018; ASH Abstract 767); clinical benefit (58% ORR, 7/12) with idasanutlin monotherapy has been reported for patients with polycythemia vera (Mascarenhas et al., 2019; ASH Abstract 134). The dual MDM2/MDM4 inhibitor ALRN_6924 led to an ORR of 27% (4/15) for patients with TP53 wildtype peripheral T_cell lymphoma in a Phase 2 study (Shustov et al., 2018; ASH Abstract 1623); responses have also been observed in TP53 wildtype AML, MDS, Merkel cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and liposarcoma (Sallman et al., 2018; ASH Abstract 4066, Meric_Bernstam et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 2505).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Inhibitors of the MDM2_p53 interaction are being tested in clinical trials.

MET has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210), with amplification positively correlating with protein expression in some cancer types (Ang et al., 2013; 23898085, Abou_Bakr and Elbasmi, 2013; 23996864, Ho et al., 2013; 24258573, Dziadziuszko et al., 2012; 22237262, Madoz_G\u00farpide et al., 2015; 26319934) and associating with therapeutic response to MET inhibitors in a variety of cancer types (Kwak et al., 2015; ASCO GI Abstract 01, Ou et al., 2011; 21623265, Schwab et al., 2014; 24192513, Lennerz et al., 2011; 22042947, Chi et al., 2012; 22162573, Palma et al., 2014; 25232318, Le et al., 2015; 25922291, Ali et al., 2015; 25882375, Kwak et al., 2015; 26432108). Rearrangements leading to a fusion of the MET kinase domain with a variety of partners predicted to constitutively dimerize and/or overexpress the MET portion, including the kinase domain (Yeh et al., 2015; 26013381, Vigna et al., 1999; 10435641, International Cancer Genome Consortium PedBrain Tumor Project et al., 2016; 27748748, Plenker et al., 2017; 29284707), have been characterized as activating and/or tumorigenic, as well as sensitive to various MET inhibitors, including crizotinib, cabozantinib, tepotinib, and foretinib in preclinical studies (Tiedt et al., 2011; 21697284, Zhang et al., 2014; 24741075, Accornero et al., 2008; 18381964, Liu et al., 2008; 18553959, Plenker et al., 2017; 29284707). Four patients with lung adenocarcinoma harboring MET fusions (Davies et al., 2017; DOI: 10.1200/PO.17.00117)(Plenker et al., 2017; 29284707, Cho et al., 2017; 29102694), a patient with lung adenocarcinoma harboring a MET kinase domain duplication (Plenker et al., 2017; 29284707), and a patient with glioblastoma harboring a MET fusion (International Cancer Genome Consortium PedBrain Tumor Project et al., 2016; 27748748) have benefited from crizotinib. A study of 53 pediatric patients with glioblastoma identified MET fusions in 11% of cases (International Cancer Genome Consortium PedBrain Tumor Project et al., 2016; 27748748). In the glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) TCGA dataset, putative amplification of MET is reported in 2.5% of cases whereas MET mutation is reported in 0.4% of cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). Lower level gain of MET has been reported in 47% and 44% of primary and secondary GBM, respectively, and in 38% of diffuse astrocytomas (Pierscianek et al., 2013; 22672415). Oncogenic fusions in receptor tyrosine kinases, including ALK, NTRK1/2/3, ROS1, and MET, are characteristic of a subset of infantile hemispheric high_grade gliomas with intermediate to good prognosis (Clarke et al., 2020; 32238360, Stucklin et al., 2019; 31554817). Multiple studies have reported MET expression to be associated with poor prognosis in patients with GBM (Abounader and Laterra, 2005; 16212809, Liu et al., 2011; 20832323, Olmez et al., 2013; 23740136); however, one study reported improved overall survival in patients with GBM expressing MET relative to those negative for MET expression (Kwak et al., 2015; 26823824). On the basis of extensive clinical evidence, MET amplification or activating mutations may predict sensitivity to MET_targeting therapies such as kinase inhibitors crizotinib, capmatinib, tepotinib, and cabozantinib. In a Phase 1b/2 trial for patients with MET_amplified recurrent glioblastoma, no responses were observed following treatment with capmatinib monotherapy (n=10) or capmatinib combined with buparlisib (n=33); patients in the combination therapy arm additionally harbored PTEN inactivating alterations (Van den Bent et al., 2020; 31776899). Crizotinib has benefited patients with MET_amplified non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of varied histologies (Vassal et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 2595, Li et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 8090, Ou et al., 2011; 21623265, Schwab et al., 2014; 24192513, Le et al., 2015; 25922291, Schrock et al., 2017; 28315738), gastroesophageal cancer (Lennerz et al., 2011; 22042947), glioblastoma (Chi et al., 2012; 22162573), and carcinoma of unknown primary (Palma et al., 2014; 25232318). Capmatinib has demonstrated clinical efficacy for patients with MET_amplified cholangiocarcinoma (Lefler et al., 2022; 35129063), as well as MET_amplified NSCLC both as a monotherapy (Schuler et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9067, Wu et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P1.01_97, Wolf et al., 2020; 32877583) and in combination with an EGFR TKI for patients with concurrent activating EGFR mutations (Wu et al., 2018; 30156984, Gainor et al., 2020; 31864558, Gautschi et al., 2020; 31864554). Tepotinib has demonstrated efficacy for patients with MET_amplified hepatocellular carcinoma (Faivre et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 329) and NSCLC (Le et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9021) as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with gefitinib for patients with MET_amplified and EGFR_mutated NSCLC (Yang et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT193, Park et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 477O, Wu et al., 2019; IASLC Abstract MA09.09). Savolitinib elicited responses for patients with MET_amplified papillary renal cell carcinoma (Gan et al., 2019; 30952639) and gastric cancer either alone or in combination with docetaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834, Kim et al., 2019; 30695737). AMG 337 elicited an ORR of 50% (5/10), including 1 CR, for patients with MET_amplified gastric, esophageal, or gastroesophageal junction cancer (Kwak et al., 2015; ASCO GI Abstract 01). Patients with MET_amplified NSCLC (Spigel et al., 2013; 24101053) or MET_amplified gastric cancer (Catenacci et al., 2011; 22389872) treated with the MET_targeting antibody onartuzumab (MetMAb) achieved clinical responses. In addition, high MET expression has been suggested to predict patient response to therapies such as the monoclonal HGF_targeting antibody rilotumumab, as well as the combination of ramucirumab and the monoclonal MET_targeting antibody emibetuzumab (Oliner et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract 4005, Harding et al., 2019; 31142504). The Phase 2 LUMINOSITY study of the MET antibody_drug conjugate telisotuzumab vedotin (teliso_V) reported a 37% (19/52) ORR for patients with non_squamous, EGFR_wildtype tumors; lower ORRs were observed for patients with squamous (11%, 3/27) or non_squamous EGFR_mutated (12%, 5/43) tumors (Camidge et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT179). A Phase 1 study showed that teliso_V plus osimertinib yielded an ORR of 56% (10/18) for patients with EGFR_mutated, MET_overexpressing NSCLC who progressed on osimertinib, including ORRs of 56% (5/9) for patients with EGFR L858R mutation and 67% (6/9) for those with EGFR exon 19 deletion (Goldman et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 9013). MET inhibitors crizotinib, capmatinib, PF_04217903, tepotinib, glesatinib, savolitinib, and foretinib have provided benefit for patients with MET_mutated papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (Choueiri et al., 2013; 23213094, Diamond et al., 2013; 23610116, Stein et al., 2015; 25457019, Choueiri et al., 2020; 32469384), histiocytic sarcoma (Frampton et al., 2015; 25971938), and non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of varied histologies (Drilon et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract OA12.02, Felip et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract OA12.01, Wolf et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9004, Schuler et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9067, Kollmannsberger et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 2589, Engstrom et al., 2017; 28765324, Paik et al., 2015; 25971939, Mazieres et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 1283P, Jenkins et al., 2015; 25769807, Waqar et al., 2015; 25898962, Mendenhall and Goldman, 2015; 25898965). Patients with MET exon 14 mutated NSCLC who were treated with 1 of several MET inhibitors exhibited superior outcomes (median OS 24.6 vs. 8.1 months; HR=0.11, p=0.04) compared with patients who were not treated with a MET inhibitor (Awad et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 8511). Tepotinib showed durable clinical activity in patients with NSCLC with MET exon 14 skipping mutations (Paik et al., 2020; 32469185, Mazieres et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 1283P), and yielded a PR lasting 9 months for a patient with HLA_DRB1_MET fusion_positive NSCLC (Blanc_Durand et al., 2020; 32716573). In another study, 11 patients with hereditary papillary RCC and germline MET mutations (4 of which were H1094R) experienced 5 PRs and 5 SDs after treatment with foretinib (Choueiri et al., 2013; 23213094). Savolitinib yielded ORRs of 49% (30/61) in patients with MET exon 14 mutated NSCLC (Lu et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 9519) and numerically higher ORR for patients with MET_driven papillary RCC compared to sunitinib (27% [9/33] vs. 7.4% [2/27]) (Choueiri et al., 2020; 32469384).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Activating MET alterations may confer sensitivity to MET inhibitors.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Capmatinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Capmatinib is a selective MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is FDA approved to treat patients with non_small cell lung cancer harboring MET exon 14 skipping_associated alterations.

Tepotinib has also been shown to be efficacious in combination with gefitinib for patients with concurrent EGFR mutation and MET amplification or MET overexpression in Phase 2 studies (Wu et al., 2019; IASLC Abstract MA09.09, Park et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 477O). In advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, Phase 2 studies of tepotinib reported improved ORR and PFS for both treatment_naive and previously treated patients with MET protein overexpression (Ryoo et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 186P, Ryoo et al., 2018; ESMO Abstract 621PD, Decaens et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 698P, Faivre et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 329). In a Phase 1 study of advanced solid tumors, tepotinib monotherapy yielded an ORR of 1.3% and a DCR of 24%, with 2 confirmed PRs observed for patients with esophageal or lung cancer and 2 unconfirmed PRs for patients with colorectal or nasopharyngeal cancer (Falchook et al., 2020; 31822497).

In a preclinical study, cabozantinib treatment reduced GBM tumor growth in 3 xenograft mouse lines, and increased survival in two of these lines, while showed no effect on the overall survival in the third line; however, combination treatment with cabozantinib resulted in sensitization of these xenografts to TMZ treatment (deCarvalho et al., 2014; AACR Abstract 3795). A Phase 1 ascending dose study of cabozantinib in patients with advanced solid tumors has reported early indications of drug response and prolonged stable disease, with no dose_limiting toxicities or serious adverse events (Yamamoto et al., 2011; AACR_EORTC Abstract C26).

The combination of cabozantinib and crizotinib has been found to result in an increase in overall survival in a glioblastoma xenograft model (Navis et al., 2013; 23484006).

MET has been reported to be amplified in cancer (Gao et al., 2013; 23550210), with amplification positively correlating with protein expression in some cancer types (Ang et al., 2013; 23898085, Abou_Bakr and Elbasmi, 2013; 23996864, Ho et al., 2013; 24258573, Dziadziuszko et al., 2012; 22237262, Madoz_G\u00farpide et al., 2015; 26319934) and associating with therapeutic response to MET inhibitors in a variety of cancer types (Kwak et al., 2015; ASCO GI Abstract 01, Ou et al., 2011; 21623265, Schwab et al., 2014; 24192513, Lennerz et al., 2011; 22042947, Chi et al., 2012; 22162573, Palma et al., 2014; 25232318, Le et al., 2015; 25922291, Ali et al., 2015; 25882375, Kwak et al., 2015; 26432108). Rearrangements leading to a fusion of the MET kinase domain with a variety of partners predicted to constitutively dimerize and/or overexpress the MET portion, including the kinase domain (Yeh et al., 2015; 26013381, Vigna et al., 1999; 10435641, International Cancer Genome Consortium PedBrain Tumor Project et al., 2016; 27748748, Plenker et al., 2017; 29284707), have been characterized as activating and/or tumorigenic, as well as sensitive to various MET inhibitors, including crizotinib, cabozantinib, tepotinib, and foretinib in preclinical studies (Tiedt et al., 2011; 21697284, Zhang et al., 2014; 24741075, Accornero et al., 2008; 18381964, Liu et al., 2008; 18553959, Plenker et al., 2017; 29284707). Four patients with lung adenocarcinoma harboring MET fusions (Davies et al., 2017; DOI: 10.1200/PO.17.00117)(Plenker et al., 2017; 29284707, Cho et al., 2017; 29102694), a patient with lung adenocarcinoma harboring a MET kinase domain duplication (Plenker et al., 2017; 29284707), and a patient with glioblastoma harboring a MET fusion (International Cancer Genome Consortium PedBrain Tumor Project et al., 2016; 27748748) have benefited from crizotinib. A study of 53 pediatric patients with glioblastoma identified MET fusions in 11% of cases (International Cancer Genome Consortium PedBrain Tumor Project et al., 2016; 27748748). In the glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) TCGA dataset, putative amplification of MET is reported in 2.5% of cases whereas MET mutation is reported in 0.4% of cases (cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). Lower level gain of MET has been reported in 47% and 44% of primary and secondary GBM, respectively, and in 38% of diffuse astrocytomas (Pierscianek et al., 2013; 22672415). Oncogenic fusions in receptor tyrosine kinases, including ALK, NTRK1/2/3, ROS1, and MET, are characteristic of a subset of infantile hemispheric high_grade gliomas with intermediate to good prognosis (Clarke et al., 2020; 32238360, Stucklin et al., 2019; 31554817). Multiple studies have reported MET expression to be associated with poor prognosis in patients with GBM (Abounader and Laterra, 2005; 16212809, Liu et al., 2011; 20832323, Olmez et al., 2013; 23740136); however, one study reported improved overall survival in patients with GBM expressing MET relative to those negative for MET expression (Kwak et al., 2015; 26823824). On the basis of extensive clinical evidence, MET amplification or activating mutations may predict sensitivity to MET_targeting therapies such as kinase inhibitors crizotinib, capmatinib, tepotinib, and cabozantinib. In a Phase 1b/2 trial for patients with MET_amplified recurrent glioblastoma, no responses were observed following treatment with capmatinib monotherapy (n=10) or capmatinib combined with buparlisib (n=33); patients in the combination therapy arm additionally harbored PTEN inactivating alterations (Van den Bent et al., 2020; 31776899). Crizotinib has benefited patients with MET_amplified non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of varied histologies (Vassal et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 2595, Li et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 8090, Ou et al., 2011; 21623265, Schwab et al., 2014; 24192513, Le et al., 2015; 25922291, Schrock et al., 2017; 28315738), gastroesophageal cancer (Lennerz et al., 2011; 22042947), glioblastoma (Chi et al., 2012; 22162573), and carcinoma of unknown primary (Palma et al., 2014; 25232318). Capmatinib has demonstrated clinical efficacy for patients with MET_amplified cholangiocarcinoma (Lefler et al., 2022; 35129063), as well as MET_amplified NSCLC both as a monotherapy (Schuler et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9067, Wu et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract P1.01_97, Wolf et al., 2020; 32877583) and in combination with an EGFR TKI for patients with concurrent activating EGFR mutations (Wu et al., 2018; 30156984, Gainor et al., 2020; 31864558, Gautschi et al., 2020; 31864554). Tepotinib has demonstrated efficacy for patients with MET_amplified hepatocellular carcinoma (Faivre et al., 2021; ASCO GI Abstract 329) and NSCLC (Le et al., 2021; ASCO Abstract 9021) as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with gefitinib for patients with MET_amplified and EGFR_mutated NSCLC (Yang et al., 2019; AACR Abstract CT193, Park et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 477O, Wu et al., 2019; IASLC Abstract MA09.09). Savolitinib elicited responses for patients with MET_amplified papillary renal cell carcinoma (Gan et al., 2019; 30952639) and gastric cancer either alone or in combination with docetaxel (Lee et al., 2019; 31315834, Kim et al., 2019; 30695737). AMG 337 elicited an ORR of 50% (5/10), including 1 CR, for patients with MET_amplified gastric, esophageal, or gastroesophageal junction cancer (Kwak et al., 2015; ASCO GI Abstract 01). Patients with MET_amplified NSCLC (Spigel et al., 2013; 24101053) or MET_amplified gastric cancer (Catenacci et al., 2011; 22389872) treated with the MET_targeting antibody onartuzumab (MetMAb) achieved clinical responses. In addition, high MET expression has been suggested to predict patient response to therapies such as the monoclonal HGF_targeting antibody rilotumumab, as well as the combination of ramucirumab and the monoclonal MET_targeting antibody emibetuzumab (Oliner et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract 4005, Harding et al., 2019; 31142504). The Phase 2 LUMINOSITY study of the MET antibody_drug conjugate telisotuzumab vedotin (teliso_V) reported a 37% (19/52) ORR for patients with non_squamous, EGFR_wildtype tumors; lower ORRs were observed for patients with squamous (11%, 3/27) or non_squamous EGFR_mutated (12%, 5/43) tumors (Camidge et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT179). A Phase 1 study showed that teliso_V plus osimertinib yielded an ORR of 56% (10/18) for patients with EGFR_mutated, MET_overexpressing NSCLC who progressed on osimertinib, including ORRs of 56% (5/9) for patients with EGFR L858R mutation and 67% (6/9) for those with EGFR exon 19 deletion (Goldman et al., 2022; ASCO Abstract 9013). MET inhibitors crizotinib, capmatinib, PF_04217903, tepotinib, glesatinib, savolitinib, and foretinib have provided benefit for patients with MET_mutated papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (Choueiri et al., 2013; 23213094, Diamond et al., 2013; 23610116, Stein et al., 2015; 25457019, Choueiri et al., 2020; 32469384), histiocytic sarcoma (Frampton et al., 2015; 25971938), and non_small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of varied histologies (Drilon et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract OA12.02, Felip et al., 2018; WCLC Abstract OA12.01, Wolf et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 9004, Schuler et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 9067, Kollmannsberger et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 2589, Engstrom et al., 2017; 28765324, Paik et al., 2015; 25971939, Mazieres et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 1283P, Jenkins et al., 2015; 25769807, Waqar et al., 2015; 25898962, Mendenhall and Goldman, 2015; 25898965). Patients with MET exon 14 mutated NSCLC who were treated with 1 of several MET inhibitors exhibited superior outcomes (median OS 24.6 vs. 8.1 months; HR=0.11, p=0.04) compared with patients who were not treated with a MET inhibitor (Awad et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 8511). Tepotinib showed durable clinical activity in patients with NSCLC with MET exon 14 skipping mutations (Paik et al., 2020; 32469185, Mazieres et al., 2020; ESMO Abstract 1283P), and yielded a PR lasting 9 months for a patient with HLA_DRB1_MET fusion_positive NSCLC (Blanc_Durand et al., 2020; 32716573). In another study, 11 patients with hereditary papillary RCC and germline MET mutations (4 of which were H1094R) experienced 5 PRs and 5 SDs after treatment with foretinib (Choueiri et al., 2013; 23213094). Savolitinib yielded ORRs of 49% (30/61) in patients with MET exon 14 mutated NSCLC (Lu et al., 2020; ASCO Abstract 9519) and numerically higher ORR for patients with MET_driven papillary RCC compared to sunitinib (27% [9/33] vs. 7.4% [2/27]) (Choueiri et al., 2020; 32469384).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "Activating MET alterations may confer sensitivity to MET inhibitors.", "Therapies": {"Therapy": [{"Name": null, "GenericName": "Capmatinib", "FDAApproved": "false", "Rationale": "<p><b>Approved Indications:</b> Capmatinib is a selective MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is FDA approved to treat patients with non_small cell lung cancer harboring MET exon 14 skipping_associated alterations.

In a preclinical study, cabozantinib treatment reduced GBM tumor growth in 3 xenograft mouse lines, and increased survival in two of these lines, while showed no effect on the overall survival in the third line; however, combination treatment with cabozantinib resulted in sensitization of these xenografts to TMZ treatment (deCarvalho et al., 2014; AACR Abstract 3795). A Phase 1 ascending dose study of cabozantinib in patients with advanced solid tumors has reported early indications of drug response and prolonged stable disease, with no dose_limiting toxicities or serious adverse events (Yamamoto et al., 2011; AACR_EORTC Abstract C26). Another Phase 1 study of cabozantinib in high_grade gliomas included 1 patient with anaplastic astrocytoma who had stable disease for >900 days (Schiff et al., 2013; Neuro_Oncology Annual Meeting Abstract MR026). A Phase 1 study examining the combination of cabozantinib and temozolomide for patients with high_grade gliomas reported that the combination was safe; however, dose reductions were common and 62% of patients experienced treatment_related grade 3/4 adverse events (Schiff et al., 2015; 26588662). The combination of cabozantinib and crizotinib has been found to result in an increase in overall survival in a glioblastoma xenograft model (Navis et al., 2013; 23484006).

In addition, PDGFRA amplification has been reported to occur in conjunction with IDH1 mutation in glioblastoma, and both alterations in the same tumor have been associated with poor patient prognosis (Phillips et al., 2013; 23438035). On the basis of extensive clinical evidence in solid tumors and hematologic cancers, PDGFRA activating alterations are associated with sensitivity to imatinib (Arefi et al., 2012; 22806436, Baccarani et al., 2007; 17666373, Cassier et al., 2012; 22718859, Chalmers et al., 2015; 25658984, Cools et al., 2003; 12660384, Curtis et al., 2007; 17555450, Debiec_Rychter et al., 2016; 15010069, Dileo et al., 2011; 20473908, Fanta et al., 2015; 24638008, Florian et al., 2006; 16406018, Frenard et al., 2016; 27051816, Griffin et al., 2003; 12808148, Heinrich et al., 2003; 14645423, Helbig et al., 2009; 19120352, Helbig et al., 2014; 24009127, Hus et al., 2011; 21093052, Ikezoe et al., 2010; 20303172, Intermesoli et al., 2009; 19735261, Jain et al., 2009; 19013640, Jovanovic et al., 2007; 17299092, Kang et al., 2012; 22150077, Klion et al., 2004; 14504092, Kobayashi et al., 2009; 19192229, Koc\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al., 2014; 24635438, Metzgeroth et al., 2008; 18950453, Murayama et al., 2012; 22645636, Ogbogu et al., 2009; 19910029, Ohnishi et al., 2006; 16856885, Pardanani et al., 2003; 12842979, Pardanani et al., 2004; 15284118, Qu et al., 2016; 27120808, Score et al., 2006; 16498388, Shah et al., 2011; 24669761, Sugimoto et al., 2015; 26319757, Volz et al., 2011; 20609486, von Bubnoff et al., 2005; 15618966, Walz et al., 2006; 16845659, Yoo et al., 2016; 26130666). Sorafenib has shown clinical and preclinical activity against the FIP1L1_PDGFRA fusion in chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) and mutations associated with clinical resistance to imatinib and sunitinib in both CEL and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)(Fumagalli et al., 2012; ESMO Abstract 1491P, Al_Riyami et al., 2013; 23157309, Lierman et al., 2006; 16645167, Lierman et al., 2009; 19212337, Metzgeroth et al., 2012; 21818111, Roubaud et al., 2012; 22294526, Von Bubnoff et al., 2011; 20972453). Complete responses to nilotinib have been reported in patients with CEL or hypereosinophilic syndrome with FIP1L1_PDGFRA or activating mutations (Hochhaus et al., 2013; 24057647, Ikezoe et al., 2010; 20303172, Tabouret et al., 2011; 20832858); preclinical evidence has reported efficacy of nilotinib in the context of PDGFRA mutations associated with GIST (Dewaele et al., 2008; 18794084, Weisberg et al., 2006; 17087936). Patients with GIST harboring PDGFRA activating mutations have been reported to derive clinical benefit from treatment with sunitinib (Heinrich et al., 2006; ASCO Abstract 9502, Brohl et al., 2015; 26396737) or regorafenib (Grellety et al., 2015; 28031906, Kollar et al., 2014; 25905001). Preclinical studies have reported sensitivity of activating PDGFRA mutations and FIP1L1_PDGFRA fusion to dasatinib (Dewaele et al., 2008; 18794084, Lierman et al., 2009; 19212337). PDGFRA D842 mutations were reported to be sensitive to avapritinib in clinical (Heinrich et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 11011, Evans et al., 2017; 29093181) and preclinical (Evans et al., 2017; 29093181) studies of GIST, and demonstrated sensitivity to ripretinib for 1 patient (Jaku et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 2515). One patient with KIT/PDGFRA/KDR_amplified GBM experienced a PR on ripretinib (de Groot at el., 2017; SNO Abstract ACTR_02, Jaku et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 2515).", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": "PDGFRA amplification may predict sensitivity to imatinib and to anti_PDGFRA antibodies.

However, other Phase 2 clinical trials of imatinib have reported no anti_tumor activity, with a study of 231 patients with glioblastoma reporting a radiographic response rate of only 3.4% (Razis et al., 2009; 19789313, Reardon et al., 2009; 19904263). In another Phase 2 study, imatinib plus hydroxyurea was shown to be well tolerated among patients with recurrent/progressive low_grade glioma, but had negligible antitumor activity (Reardon et al., 2012; 22371319). </p>", "ApprovedUses": null, "Effect": "Sensitizing", "Include": "true", "IncludeInSummary": "true", "ReferenceLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": {"ClinicalTrialLink": {"nctId": "NCT01738139", "Include": "true"}}}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "ATRX", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "E533*", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "E533*"}}, "Interpretation": "ATRX encodes a SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling protein implicated in histone variant H3.3 deposition, transcriptional regulation, and telomere maintenance (Clynes et al., 2013; 23916100, Ratnakumar and Bernstein, 2013; 23249563). ATRX inactivation or loss of expression is associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)(Lovejoy et al., 2012; 22829774, Bower et al, 2012; 23185534; Heaphy et al., 2011; 21719641, Liau et al., 2015; 25229770). Alterations that disrupt the ADD domain (aa 167_270) or helicase domain (aa 2010_2280) of ATRX are predicted to result in loss of ATRX function (Nan et al., 2007; 17296936, Garrick et al., 2004; 14729260, Eustermann et al., 2011; 21666677); however, the loss of ATRX function is not sufficient to induce ALT, which requires other undetermined factors (Clynes et al., 2013; 23916100, Flynn et al., 2015; 25593184). Germline mutations in ATRX give rise to alpha_thalassemia X_linked intellectual disability syndrome (ATR_X syndrome)(Gibbons et al., 1995; 7697714). Somatic mutation of ATRX has been reported in a number of solid tumor types, often associated with ALT (Heaphy et al., 2011; 21719641). ATRX mutation correlating with ALT has been reported in 10_20% of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs)(Singhi et al., 2015; USCAP Abstract 1797)(Jiao et al., 2011; 21252315, Heaphy et al., 2011; 21719641), 12.6% of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (Fishbein et al., 2015; 25608029), and 48% of adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with glioblastoma (GBM) or neuroblastoma (Morosini et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 11008)(Cheung et al., 2012; 22416102, Molenaar et al., 2012; 22367537, Pugh et al., 2013; 23334666, Cheung and Dyer, 2013; 23702928). ATRX loss in PNET (Singhi et al., 2015; USCAP Abstract 1797)(Marinoni et al., 2014; 24148618) and melanoma (Qadeer et al., 2014; 24468746) and mutation in other neuroendocrine tumors (Fishbein et al., 2015; 25608029) is associated with poor prognosis. Pediatric patients with high_grade glioma and ATRX mutation were shown to have more aggressive disease but are more responsive to treatment with double_strand break therapy (Koschmann et al., 2016; 26936505). ATRX mutation or loss of expression is more frequent in Grade 2/3 astrocytoma and secondary GBM than primary GBM, oligodendroglioma, and oligoastrocytoma (Kannan et al., 2012; 23104868, Haberler and W\u00f6hrer, 2014; 24559763, Reuss et al., 2014; 25427834, Sahm et al., 2014; 25143301) and has been proposed as a distinguishing biomarker (Haberler and W\u00f6hrer, 2014; 24559763, Reuss et al., 2014; 25427834, Sahm et al., 2014; 25143301). ATRX mutation has not been detected in concurrence with MYCN amplification in glioma and neuroblastoma (Cheung et al., 2012; 22416102, Molenaar et al., 2012; 22367537, Pugh et al., 2013; 23334666, Cheung and Dyer, 2013; 23702928). Low_grade gliomas with both IDH1/2 mutation and ATRX mutation are associated with worse prognosis than those with IDH1/2 mutation but no ATRX mutation (Haberler and W\u00f6hrer, 2014; 24559763). Loss of ATRX protein expression has been reported in 33_39% of incidences of leiomyosarcoma (LMS) associating with ALT, a poor prognostic factor across all LMS subtypes, and with poor prognosis in extrauterine LMS but not in uterine LMS (Singhi et al., 2015; USCAP Abstract 93)(Liau et al., 2015; 25229770). No targeted therapies are available to directly address ATRX inactivation. Based on preclinical (Liang et al., 2020; 31551363, Garbarino et al., 2021; 34118569) and limited clinical data (Cole et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT059), ATRX alterations may confer sensitivity to combination strategies involving WEE1 inhibition. In a Phase 2 study evaluating the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib plus irinotecan for the treatment of pediatric patients with neuroblastoma, prolonged SD was reported for 44% (4/9) of patients with ATRX_deficient tumors and responses were seen in two tumors that had evidence of ALT (Cole et al., 2021; AACR Abstract CT059). Preclinical evidence also suggests that ATRX deficiency may impart sensitivity to synthetic lethal approaches involving PARP inhibition and irinotecan (George et al., 2020; 32846370), combined PARP and ATR inhibition (Garbarino et al., 2021; 34118569), or double_strand break_induction with agents such as doxorubicin, irinotecan, and topotecan (Koschmann et al., 2016; 26936505); however, these approaches have not been demonstrated clinically.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}, {"Name": "KDR", "Include": "true", "Alterations": {"Alteration": {"Name": "amplification", "AlterationProperties": {"AlterationProperty": {"isEquivocal": "false", "name": "amplification"}}, "Interpretation": "KDR encodes vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) family. It is a receptor tyrosine kinase that transmits signals from VEGFA and is involved in both tumor angiogenesis and vasculogenesis during development (Takahashi, 2011; 22130231). KDR amplification has been reported in many tumor types and may be oncogenic (Takahashi, 2011; 22130231). KDR mutation has been reported in 2.0% of glioma samples analyzed in COSMIC (Jan 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878). In the TCGA datasets, KDR amplification has been reported in 2.5% of lower grade gliomas and 6.2% of glioblastomas (grade IV astrocytoma)(Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2015; 26061751, cBio_Brennan et al., 2013; 24120142). In the scientific literature, KDR amplification has been reported in 3_39% of glioblastomas analyzed (Nobusawa et al., 2011; 21382095, Joensuu et al., 2005; 16021678). Amplification of KDR has been strongly correlated with the presence of KIT and/or PDGFRA amplification in glioblastomas (Joensuu et al., 2005; 16021678, Holtkamp et al., 2007; 17504929, Puputti et al., 2006; 17189383). The activity of VEGFR2 has been shown to be correlated with disease progression in gliomas; a study reported constitutive activity of VEGFR2 in 71% and 15% of glioblastomas and anaplastic gliomas, respectively, but not in low grade gliomas (Carroll et al., 1999; 10506722, Plate et al., 1994; 7525492). In addition, increased VEGFR2 expression has been associated with poor progression_free survival in recurrent high_grade gliomas (Kuczynski et al., 2011; 21985798). On the basis of clinical benefit for patients with ccRCC (Beuselinck et al., 2018; 29095068, Song et al., 2015; 26228213, Dornbusch et al., 2013; 24086736, Terakawa et al., 2013; 21478036, You et al., 2015; 24710685) and a patient with breast angiosarcoma (Silva et al., 2015; 25639617), high VEGFR_2 expression has been associated with sensitivity to sunitinib. However, because data supporting concordance between VEGFR_2 expression and KDR genomic biomarkers are limited, it is unclear whether these therapeutic strategies would be beneficial in this case. On the basis of extensive clinical evidence across multiple tumor types, expression of plasma or tumor VEGFR_1 or VEGFR_2 has not been established as a reliable biomarker to predict response to the VEGFA_targeted agent bevacizumab (Baumgarten et al., 2016; 26627848, Sathornsumetee et al., 2008; 18182667, Olafson et al., 2019; 31582283, Nishikawa et al., 2013; ASCO Abstract 2023, Wick et al., 2013; WCN Abstract 1207, Duda et al., 2010; 20484123, Stremitzer et al., 2016; 27535973, Weickhardt et al., 2015; 26125443, Kopetz et al., 2009; 20008624, Miles et al., 2013; 23422754, Fountzilas et al., 2011; 21868552, Gianni et al., 2013; 23569311, S\u00e1nchez_Rovira et al., 2013; 23397155, Cameron et al., 2013; 23932548, Mok et al., 2014; 24807156, An et al., 2014; 24577128, Bais et al., 2017; 29059426, Cohen et al., 2009; 19201650, Van Cutsem et al., 2011; EMCC Abstract 803, Van Cutsem et al., 2012; 22565005, Lee et al., 2018; 29941486, Xu et al., 2009; 19826039, Heist et al., 2014; 25605928).

Germline de novo mutations of MLL2 are responsible for the majority of cases of Kabuki syndrome, a complex and phenotypically distinctive developmental disorder (Hannibal et al., 2011; 21671394). A significant number of inactivating MLL2 alterations have been observed in multiple tumor types, suggesting a tumor suppressor role (Fagan et al.,2019; 31128216). MLL2 alterations are observed in a number of solid tumor contexts (COSMIC, Jan 2022)(Tate et al., 2019; 30371878), and are especially prevalent in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2012; 22960745) and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) (Augert et al., 2017; 28007623). MLL2 mutation was found to be an independent prognostic factor of poor PFS and OS in non_small cell lung cancer, but not in SCLC (Ardeshir_Larijani et al., 2018; 29627316). One study reported that MLL2 truncating mutations were more common in recurrent ovary granulosa cell tumors (GCT) compared with primary GCTs (24% [10/42] vs. 3.0% [1/32])(Hillman et al., 2018; 29950560). In a study of esophageal SCC, high MLL2 expression positively correlated with tumor stage, differentiation, and size, and negatively correlated with OS (Abudureheman et al., 2018; 29532228).

Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). This sample is microsatellite_stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947).

A large_scale study did not find high_level microsatellite instability (MSI_H) in any of 129 GBM samples (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), although a small_scale study reported MSI_H in 4 of 15 pediatric GBMs and 1 of 12 adult GBMs (Szybka et al., 2003; 12908754). The frequency of MSI has been reported to be increased in relapsed compared to primary GBM (Martinez et al., 2004; 15331927), in GBMs with a previous lower grade astrocytoma (Martinez et al., 2005; 15672285), and in giant cell GBM compared to classic GBM (Martinez et al., 2007; 17498554).

This sample harbors a TMB below levels that would be predicted to be associated with sensitivity to PD_1_ or PD_L1_targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents (Touat et al., 2020; 32322066, Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556, Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642). Anaplastic astrocytoma harbors a median TMB of 1.8 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb), and 2% of cases have high TMB (>20 muts/Mb)(FMI_Chalmers et al., 2017; 28420421). For pediatric patients, high TMB has been reported in a subset of high_grade gliomas, frequently in association with mutations in mismatch repair or proofreading genes and in TP53, whereas BRAF alterations or other oncogene fusions were observed more frequently in brain tumors harboring low TMB (Patel et al., 2020; 32386112, Johnson et al., 2017; 28912153). Increased TMB has been reported to correlate with higher tumor grade in glioma (Draaisma et al., 2015; 26699864) and glioblastoma (GBM) tissue samples with biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD) (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570), as well as with shorter OS of patients with diffuse glioma (Wang et al., 2020; 32164609). On the basis of clinical evidence in solid tumors, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti_PD_L1 (Legrand et al., 2018; ASCO Abstract 12000, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), anti_PD_1 therapies (Cristescu et al., 2018; 30309915, Goodman et al., 2017; 28835386, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Marabelle et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 11920, Goodman et al., 2019; 31405947), and combination nivolumab and ipilimumab (Ready et al., 2019; 30785829, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29658845, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29657128, Rizvi et al., 2017; WCLC Abstract 1106, Hellmann et al., 2018; 29731394, Rozeman et al., 2021; 33558721, Hodi et al., 2019; AACR abstract CT037, Lee et al., 2019; ASCO Abstract 641, Sharma et al., 2020; 32916128). In glioma, a lack of association between TMB and clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors has been reported (Kamiya_Matsuoka et al., 2019; ESMO Abstract 393O, Zhao et al., 2019; 30742119, Samstein et al., 2019; 30643254, Touat et al., 2020; 32322066). However, multiple case studies have reported that patients with ultramutated gliomas driven by POLE mutations have benefited from treatment with anti_PD_1 (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570, Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556) or anti_PD_L1 (Lukas et al., 2018; 30073642) therapies. Therefore, although increased TMB alone may not be a strong biomarker for PD_1 or PD_L1 inhibitors in this cancer type, these agents may have efficacy for patients with glioma harboring both high TMB and POLE mutation.", "Include": "true", "ClinicalTrialNote": null, "Therapies": null, "ReferenceLinks": null, "ClinicalTrialLinks": null}}, "ReferenceLinks": null}]}, "Trials": {"Trial": [{"Gene": "CDK4", "Alteration": "amplification", "Title": "A Study of BPI_1178 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor and HR+/HER2_ Breast Cancer", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1/2", "Target": "CDK6, CDK4, ER, Aromatase", "Locations": "Shanghai (China)", "NCTID": "NCT04282031", "Note": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "CDK4", "Alteration": "amplification", "Title": "Efficacy and Safety of Targeted Precision Therapy in Refractory Tumor With Druggable Molecular Event", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "EGFR, ERBB4, ERBB2, PARP, mTOR, MET, ROS1, RET, VEGFRs, BRAF, CDK4, CDK6", "Locations": "Shanghai (China)", "NCTID": "NCT03239015", "Note": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "CDK4", "Alteration": "amplification", "Title": "Ribociclib (LEE011) in Preoperative Glioma and Meningioma Patients", "StudyPhase": "PHASE null", "Target": "CDK6, CDK4", "Locations": "Arizona", "NCTID": "NCT02933736", "Note": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "CDK4", "Alteration": "amplification", "Title": "Safety and Oversight of the Individually Tailored Treatment Approach: A Novel Pilot Study", "StudyPhase": "PHASE null", "Target": "CDK4, CDK6, PI3K_alpha, PD_L1, MEK, PARP, PD_1, BRAF", "Locations": "Melbourne (Australia)", "NCTID": "NCT04801966", "Note": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "CDK4", "Alteration": "amplification", "Title": "A Study of Abemaciclib in Recurrent Glioblastoma", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "CDK4, CDK6", "Locations": "Utah, California, Massachusetts", "NCTID": "NCT02981940", "Note": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "CDK4", "Alteration": "amplification", "Title": "The Finnish National Study to Facilitate Patient Access to Targeted Anti_cancer Drugs", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "BRAF, VEGFRs, RET, KIT, ERBB2, TRKB, ALK, TRKC, ROS1, TRKA, SMO, PD_L1, MEK, CDK4, CDK6", "Locations": "Kuopio (Finland), Helsinki (Finland), Tampere (Finland)", "NCTID": "NCT05159245", "Note": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "CDK4", "Alteration": "amplification", "Title": "Genetic Testing in Guiding Treatment for Patients With Brain Metastases", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "TRKB, ALK, TRKC, ROS1, TRKA, CDK4, CDK6, PI3K, mTOR", "Locations": "Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana", "NCTID": "NCT03994796", "Note": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "CDK4", "Alteration": "amplification", "Title": "A Study Evaluating the Activity of Anti_cancer Treatments Targeting Tumor Molecular Alterations/Characteristics in Advanced / Metastatic Tumors.", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "CDK6, CDK4, MDM2, MET, ROS1, RET, VEGFRs", "Locations": "Nice (France), Lyon (France), Marseille (France), Toulouse (France), Bordeaux (France)", "NCTID": "NCT04116541", "Note": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "CDK4", "Alteration": "amplification", "Title": "(VELA) Study of BLU_222 in Advanced Solid Tumors", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 1/2", "Target": "ER, CDK4, CDK6, CDK2", "Locations": "Massachusetts, Texas, Florida", "NCTID": "NCT05252416", "Note": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "CDK4", "Alteration": "amplification", "Title": "Palbociclib In Progressive Brain Metastases", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "CDK4, CDK6", "Locations": "Massachusetts", "NCTID": "NCT02896335", "Note": "CDK4 amplification may predict sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.", "Include": "true"}, {"Gene": "KIT", "Alteration": "amplification", "Title": "Cryoablation Combined With Sintilimab Plus Lenvatinib In Previously Treated Unresectable Liver Metastasis From Solid Tumors", "StudyPhase": "PHASE 2", "Target": "FGFRs, RET, PDGFRA, VEGFRs, KIT, PD_1", "Locations": "Shanghai (China)", "NCTID": "NCT05098847", "Note": "KIT amplification or activating mutations may predict sensitivity to small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
